When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call

Darling, that's all that you have to do
Show me a sign
A word or a line
One stitch in time
To save this poor heart
From breaking

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
I'll still be your friend

Right to the end of our river
And further still
This hurt it will mend
And I hope you'll remember all the time
Hope you'll remember every line
Hope you'll remember
All the love, all the love, all the love

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Just say my name

You don't have to say it loud
I'll still feel the same
I'll still be true
Waiting for you
To come sailing through
Cos I you know you can

When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
When that hurt in your heart has gone
Give me a call
