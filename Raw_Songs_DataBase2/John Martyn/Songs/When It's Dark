When I go away I know we sleep alone
And cold together, far apart
And close my eyes and I can feel you there
Warm and easy in my heart

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
I just want to be there darling when you start
I just want to be here darling when you start
I just want to be here darling when you start to fly

Never leave you, couldn't stay away
You've been my best friend for a while
And couldn't leave you, couldn't live alone
I couldn't be without your smile

And I never want to leave you, never want to say goodbye
Oh, I just want to be there darling when you cry
I just to be there darling when you start
I just want to be there darling when you start to fly

And I go away, the sun don't shine so warm
The people smile but not for me
And I go away the nights are twice as long
The wind blows lonely through the trees

And I never want to hurt you, never want to say goodbye
And I only want to love you darling when you start
I only want to be there darling when you start
I only want to be here lover when you start to fly

And I go away I know we sleep alone
Alone and lonely and far apart
And close my eyes and I can feel you there
Warm and easy in my heart

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
Oh I just want to be there darling when you start
Just want to be there darling when you start
I just want to be there darling when you start to fly

When I'm awake the sun don't shine so warm
The people smile but not for me
When I'm away the nights are twice as long
The wind blows lonely through the trees

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
And I only want to be there darling when you start
I only want to be here lover when you start
I only want to be there lover when you start to fly

Couldn't leave you, couldn't stay away
You've been my best friend for a while
Just couldn't leave you, couldn't live alone
I wanted be without your smile

And I never want to hurt you, never want to make you cry
I just want to be there, darling when you start
I just want to be there, darling when you start
I just want to be there, darling when you start to fly
