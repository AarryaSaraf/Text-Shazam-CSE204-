Did you hear a story about cocaine, Lill?
She had a cocaine house on cocaine hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine rat
And it's all round my brain

Been walking around 10th street and main
I've been looking for a girlie to give me cocaine
Cocaine sure running round my brain
Been strolling round 10th street and main
Been looking for someone to give me cocaine
Cocaine, sure running round my brain

Well, cocaine Lill and morphine Sue
They've been strolling down the avenue, two by two
Says Lill to Sue, it's gonna do no harm
If we both have a little old shot in the arm
And it's all round my veins, oh cocaine

Doctor tell me again and again
He says, cocaine's forces ain't for men
Cocaine sure running round my brain
You know the doctor tells me, tells me again and again
He says, cocaine will kill you son, it won't say when
Cocaine sure running round my brain

There's this story about cocaine, Lill
She had a cocaine house on cocaine hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine rat
And it's all round my brain

Yonder's baby, she's dressed in white
I said, hey now mama, gonna stay all night
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
Now there runs my baby, she's all dressed in black
You said, you know I didn't mean it, won't you please come back?
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

Hey baby, please come quick
This old cocaine's making me sick
Cocaine sure running round my brain
