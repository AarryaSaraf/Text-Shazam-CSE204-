Album: Salute

// Salute (A Lot More Livin' To Do) //

Listen mister I won't waste your time
I hope all the mistakes you made were a lot like mine
Lovin' girls too much sometimes they made you cry
Maybe we've got more livin' to do with a lot less pain
Here, let's drink to you
These are the words I knew would break the ice
I held my hand out and he shook it twice
It seemed to me like I'd been here before
Deja vu, familiar voice
And the salute of my choice

Salute gentlemen of days gone by
Ladies of leisure and of flashing eye
May some romantic fool turn on your light
As for me I'm in between
All that I can do is dream

You got a lot more livin' to do
And a lot more lovin' too

When you make it through the night with no end in sight
And the dawn peeks through
You got a lot more livin' to do

Salute nightingales upon the tide
Brothers of the cloth tonight who must be tried
May all of your martinis be forever dry
As for me I'm in between
All that I can do is dream

You got a lot more livin' to do
And a lot more lovin' too
When you make it through the night with no end in sight
And the dawn peeks through
You got a lot more livin' to do
And a lot more lovin' too
You got a lot more livin' to do
And a lot more lovin' too

// Gotta Get Away //

I'm on my way, got no time to waste
Places to go, people to chase
Gonna grab my comb 'n my toothpaste
Gotta get away from here
Twenty-one years from the day I was born
I was workin' on the night shift tootin' my horn
Through sheets of rain, through sleet and storm
You come to me 
You were the girls with the summer sunshine
In your eyes and in your smile
You were the one I thought I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here 

I'm a real bad loser that's what I am
Gonna grab my hat and my hexagram
You can stick my money in an old tin can
I think I fell in love again
I was down by the bus stop bidin' my time
I was hitchin' a ride with a friend of mine
Iwas almost gone, I was over the line
I said what's come over me 

You were the girl with the sound of springtime
In your songs and in your voice
You were the one I thought loved me
It was somethin' I never could quite believe
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get back to you 

I'm gonna make it today, I'm gonna get on my toes
Been awake so long I'm getting ready to doze
Gonna grab my bag and a few old clothes
Gotta get away from here
Gotta get back to you
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away, gotta get away
Gotta get away

// Whispers Of The North //

Whispers of the north
Soon I will go forth
To that wild and barren land
Where nature takes its course
Whispers of the wind
Soon I will be there again
Bound with a wild and restless drive
That pulls me from within 
And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away 

Whispers of the north
Soon I will return again
To those endless afternoons
In sunshine and in rain
Whispers of my love
Days and weeks on end
I will share my thoughts of her
In prayers that I will send 

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away 

Whispers of the north
The river and the shore
In the land that tested Eskimos
Ten thousand years before
Whispers of my heart
In the tracks of animals
I will leave my footprints there
To lie beneath the snow 

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away 

Whispers of the wind
I will feel it sting
I will see it rise and fall
I will hear it sing
The sound is like a song to me
It takes away the pain
The river is the melody
And sky is the refrain 

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away 

And we can ride away
We can glide all day
And we can fly away 

Whispers of the north
Soon I will go forth
Whispers of the north
Soon I will go forth

// Someone To Believe In //

Is there someone I can believe in
Is there somewhere I can hide
Take me out of the straits I'm in
Come and stay here by my side
Somebody I can rely on
I broke the law, I've been set free
Give me something to decide upon
Come and show yourself to me 
Is there someone sewing seams
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams
You know living a life of ease
Don't make yer meals taste better
If you please 

Is there someone I can relate to
Who will break the ice for me
Take me out of the place I'm in
Come and share your life with me
Somebody with nothing to live up to
Who will mend my broken dreams
Give me a wave I can ride upon
Come and show your strength to me 

I have felt the final rush
Of love's embrace, the magic touch
Running headlong to attract
I felt the breath of Satan
On my back 

Is there someone I can believe in
Is there something I can do
Take me out of the straits I'm in
Let me show myself to you
Somebody to whom I can belong
Take my hand, I've been set free
Give me some wings I can glide upon
Come and show yourself to me 

Is there someone sewings seams
Through all my hopes, through all my dreams
You know living a life of ease
Don't make yer meals taste better
If you please

// Romance //

You said you were through with romance
Why take a chance on anyone
You're so beautiful too
I can tell by the way that you dance
They say that people don't change
Why rearrange the original
You do something to me
That my eyes cannot see at a glance 
Signs of a new beginning
Signs of a life worth living
The better to forget than to be all that upset
It's the time to taste the wine 

And maybe someday things will change
And come with in range and be laughable
Everything is okay
I can tell by the way that you dance
They say that people don't try
That's just a lie, they work miracles
It's a gift from above
When we talk about love and romance 

Signs of a new tomorrow
Signs of a life without sorrow
The better to forget than to be all that upset
It's the time to taste the wine 

And maybe this time you will be
Romantic like me when I'm with you
And I think you might say
I can tell by the way that you dance
They say that people don't change
Like Home On The Range, it's original
You do something to me
That my eyes cannot see at a glance
You do something to me
When we talk about love and romance

// Knotty Pine //

She's my knotty pine
She leans with the wind, She cries turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me but I don't mind
Only now and then
When her branches lean beneath the snow

She's knotty but nice
Reaching for the sky, she don't like snow 'n ice
To leave things as they stand is my advice
She's been good to me
So I tend to go there when I can 

She's my knotty pine
Such a pretty scene, she tries to be kind
She gives birds a home and shelters them
In her coat of green
She's as green as evergreen can be 

She's a real delight
When little breezes call to ruffle up her skin
All her sap runs free and sticks to me
Hidden deep within
I will be her slave eternally 

She's knotty but wise
She holds her anger in, trees are her disguise
Cones are taking root before my eyes
Find them if you can
Among her boughs she keeps them out of sight

She's my knotty pine
Sunlight in her hair by the serpentine
Though she is independent, I don't mind
Standing over there
Just beyond that maple on the right

She's my knotty pine
She leans with the wind, she crys turpentine
Sometimes she nettles me but I don't mind
Only now and then
When her branches lean beneath the snow

// Biscuit City //

I'd like to be in Biscuit City
With my banjo in my hand
I don't need no long vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
Has been turning to a sigh
I wish that I could make the time
To be in Biscuit City by and by 
Oh the water is of emerald
And the beach is white as snow
And everyone's got money
And no place to go
In a land of milk and honey
It can really make you smile
And if I had a ticket
I would stay in Biscuit City for a while 

All the girls are in bikinis
All the boys are in the buff
With the baby in between and 
That makes three of us
And the streets are all so quiet
And the walls are squeaky clean
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til
The town of Biscuit City you have seen 

I'd rather be in Biscuit City
With my banjo in my hand
Than take a big vacation
In some foreign land
Cause the sound of my own breathing
has been turning to a sigh
If it were not for misfortune
I would be in Biscuit City by and by
If it were not for misfortune
I would stay in Biscuit City 'til I die

// Without You //

If I can last through another sunrise
In the past I knew what to do
But this was such a grim surprise
If I wait for the sun to shine
How can I pass the time
Without you, without you 
If I can break the spell that is in me
Any fool would no where to go
I guess I'd better send a mayday
If I find me a rainbow's end
how will I find it then
Without you, without you
Without you 

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you 

If I can last, wait until the wind dies
I've been all up and down like a clown
And this is such a thin disguise
If I wait for the sun to shine
How will I pass the time
Without you, without you
Without you 

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you

// Tattoo //

Whatever you think of me
I'm still your friend
So other than nothin' what's new
The water 's still flowin'
Through the rose on my skin
This here tattoo is for you 
The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste anytime puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away I can see it 
Go sailin' on by as it slips through my fingers
The bow and the wave never wait for tomorrow
They just keep on rollin' as straight as an arrow
Good night 

Girl of my dreams 
You get better each day
I wish I could see you somehow
Girls that I love is there no other way
This here tattoo is for now 

I'd been out drinkin' all day
I got carried away at the parlor last night
This summer rose is for you it's no wonder
I bothered to wander back into the parlor
It's red and in bloom and it's more than one color
It lives on forever for just a few dollars
Good night 

Whatever you think of me
I'm still your friend
So baby whatever you do
Now that it's taken its permanent home
This here tattoo is for you 

The boys at the parlor downtown
Didn't waste any time puttin' it down
Time has been wastin' away, you know time doesn't
Wait for nobody to find what they're after
It just keeps on rolling on down the deep canyons
And through the green meadows into the broad ocean
Good night 

Whatever you think of me
I'm still your friend
So other than nothin' what's new
The water's still flowing
Through the rose on my skin
This here tattoo is for you
The water's still flowin 
Through the rose on my skin
This here tattoo is for you

// Broken Dreams //

There's an ocean in my mind
I'd give the world if I could find
A sailing ship and leave the past behind
Now that I must say adieu
It's killing me, I'm telling you
When freedom calls what can a person do 
I have felt the winds of change
Go stealing through my heart and soul
How wild it seems
In love songs and in nursery rhymes
On movie screens, in fairy tales
Lie broken dreams
Life's broken dreams
Love's broken dreams 

Sometimes a broken dream
Will make you sad or make you mean
Sometimes things ain't as bad as they might seem
You might walk a lonely street
Until one day you chance to meet
A stranger who might ask where have you been 

You will see the light of change
Come shining through your windowpane
When hope is gone
Though money, fame, and riches are
For fools and kings or anything
That turns them on
Life's broken deals
Life's spinning wheels 

There's an ocean I have found
I'd like to sail the world around
And dream about the life I hope I'll find
Now that I must say adieu
To love's returns, I'm telling you
When freedom comes what can a person do 

I have felt the winds of change
Go stealing through my heart and soul
How wild they seem
In sounds of spring, in winter storms
In autumn gales, on summer morns
Lie broken dreams
In love songs and in nursery rhymes
On movie screens, in fairy tales
Like broken dreams
Life's broken dreams
Love's broken dreams
