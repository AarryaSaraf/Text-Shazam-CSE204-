// The Circle Is Small //

It's alright for some, but not alright for me
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me
Baby, can't you see that I know how it is

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright for some, but not alright to be
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found
The city where we live might be quite large
But the circle is small
Why not tell us all, and then all of us will know

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

It's alright to leave, but not alright to lie
When you come home and you can't say where you've been
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see
And you're doin' it to me
Baby, can't you see, that I know how it is

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

I can see it in your eyes and feel it in the way you kiss my lips
I can hear it in your voice whenever we are talking like this
I can see what you believe in when his name is mentioned and I die
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk, the way you close your eyes

// Daylight Katy //

She walks by the sea where the seaworld is
And she waits for the man to come
She lives in town with her high-heeled friends
And she knows it's a long way down
But she doesn't have to get up in the morning
With her hair so soft and long

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home 

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home 

She walks to the sea where the seaweed is
Where the rust in the dirt runs deep
She lives nine lives in her midnight world
While her old man's fast asleep
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'
With her hair so soft and long 

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home 

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home 

She lives by the sea when the summer wind comes
And the sea don't mind at all
She talks to the sea when the sea runs wild
And the waves run steep and tall
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'
With her hair so soft and long 

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home 

Daylight Katy come on
Daylight Katy come on
If you can't follow me down
Daylight Katy go home

// Sweet Guinevere //

Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, if you're kind

She loves a young man and he lives in the town
And he leaves the house early for he works underground
He makes a good wage for a coal miner's son
And she's a bit pretty, just turned twenty-one 

Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, shut the blind 

She knows her good mother's not feelin' no pain
She remembers an explosion and the black falling rain
She paints her thin lips in her dewy-eyed way
Then she says to the daughter, dear daughter I pray 

Sweet Guinevere you're off to the coal town tonight
And your young brother Ernie's up in Pittsburgh PA
You know mother loves you, and dad's in the mine
So don't go to the coal town, Guinevere, if you're kind

// Hangdog Hotel Room //

I go in for singing, I do it for my pay
But the kind of gig I can really dig is swiggin' at the break of day
With a few good friends and neighbors into playin' the nighttime tunes
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room

Oh Lord it feels so good to play a nighttime tune
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room

I believe in magic, a little monkeyshines
But the kind of row I can really hoe is playin' in tune on time
With rhythms all around us we're like weavers at the loom
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room 

Oh Lord it feels so good to play a nighttime tune
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room 

When it comes to mornin' and goin' out at night
Well the kind of test that I like the best is rubbin' the wrong girl right
And a few good friends and neighbors into playin' the nighttime tunes
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room 

Oh Lord it feels so good to play a nighttime tune
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room
With rhythms all around us we're like weavers at the loom
So pass the jar and that old guitar in this hangdog hotel room

// If There's A Reason //

If you should need me deep in the night
My arms (will open?) in shades of twilight
If there's a reason for livin' without me
Just let me know and I'll move on 
Down to the station with the big wheels burnin'
Gonna get there my ticket to play out that role which I've been given 

Home is where the heart is
But at times a good home must be broken
The wine has grown bitter
From the harsh words we have spoken 

If there's a chance for someone else
To make you feel life is worth livin'
Give it a try oh lady
Just let me know and I'll move on 

Home is where the heart is
But at times a good home must be broken
The wine has grown bitter
From the harsh words we have spoken 

If you should need me deep in the night
At shades of twilight
If there's a reason for livin' without me
Just let me know and I'll go on livin'

// Endless Wire //

I ain't got nothin' to hide
My mind is an endless wire
I got both feet on the ground
I ain't got no one for hire
I ain't got a thing to show
My lives have all expired
So don't go foolin' around
An' set my wheels afire 

Down in the dark of a burnt out soul
There's a few good second hand dreams
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you
Down in the black of a bottomless hole
There's a few good second hand scenes
Deep in the dark of a heavenly blue
Where the sea runs green 

I ain't got nothin' to give
My life is an endless climb
My love's a paperback dream
I don't have nothin' but time
I ain't got a thing to show
I don't know my own name
So don't go foolin' around
An' set my wheels aflame 

Down in the dark of a beat out soul
There's a few good second hand dreams
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you
Down in the black of a bottomless hole
There's a few good second hand scenes
Deep in the dark of a heavenly blue
Where the sea runs green 

I ain't got nothin' to hide
My mind is an endless wire
I got both feet on the ground
I don't have no one for hire
I ain't got a thing to show
My life is an endless rhyme
My love's a paperback dream
I ain't got nothin' but time

// Dreamland //

You come to me in times of need
When you can't find anyone
You seem to be much better off now
There's a rainbow number one
We could see life through the gutter then
Till it caused my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to take 

Sometimes I remember when
We were all dressed up in style
I don't recall the gist of it all
But you drove the young men wild
You could wrap me around your finger
Till it caused my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to take 
So if you need me near you
You can do it if you choose
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to lose 

You make me do what you want me to do
Then you run the rules on me
You seem to be the wiser now
Could it be you've been deceived
Anytime you felt like tryin'
You would cause my heart to break
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love mistake 

So if you need me near you now
You can do it if you choose
There was too much toil in dreamland
And too much love to lose

// Songs The Minstrel Sang //

It's almost over it's almost done
And you can't put the blame on anyone
It's almost easy and it's almost fun
Did you get caught with your britches on

Hi derry day in the month of May
Was the song the minstrel sang
To the good of Robin Hood
Maid Marian and all the gang 

His aim was mean and his shot was clean
And his suit was the shade of evergreen
The folks he knew hadn't naught to fear
When the sheriff was there they were over here 

Hi derry doon in the month of June
Was the song the minstrel sung
To the good of Robin Hood's
Good name and a place to run 

He loved strong ale and a run down jail
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed
There was no man on the sea or land
Who could get Maid Marian on the trail 

Hi derry day in the month of May
Was the song the minstrel sang
To the good of Robin Hood
Maid Marian and all the gang 

It's almost over it's almost done
And you can't put the blame on Marian
She almost made it to the friar's gate
But the old wooden bridge wouldn't elevate 

Hi derry doon in the month of June
Was the song the minstrel sung
To the good of Robin Hood's
Good name and a place to run

// Sometimes I Don't Mind //

Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine
Sometimes I need the rain
Sometimes I don't mind the fun times
Sometimes they're all the same

When I'm thinking of you
There's a fever around I don't know what to do
When I'm drinking to you
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues 

Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine
Sometimes I need the rest
Sometimes I don't mind a good time
Sometimes I do what's best 

When I'm thinking of you
Then I leave her alone this is sad this is true (?)
When I'm drinking to you
I get down in the mouth tell me what can I do 

Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine
Sometimes I need the change
Sometimes I don't mind a fun time
To me it's all the same 

When I'm thinking of you
There's a feeling inside which is long overdue
When I'm drinking to you
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues

Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine
Sometimes I need the rain
Sometimes I don't mind the good times
Sometimes they're all the same

When I'm thinking of you
There's a fever around I don't know what to do
When I'm drinking to you
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues

// If Children Had Wings //

There's a love I hold dear
And it shines through each year
And it makes things seem different somehow
It's for better or worse
It's for people who thirst
For a love that burns brighter right now

And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by 

There were things that were said
There were things that were done
And a wife cannot stand too much pain
And what I thought was best
Couldn't please her much less
But my love still goes on, that don't change 

And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by 

And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone
And if children had wings I would sing them this song
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye
Everything will be fine by and by
