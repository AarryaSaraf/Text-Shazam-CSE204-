Album: BackHereOnEarth

// Long Way Back Home //

From the railhead to the boatyard
From the factory to the farm
From the mines to the millhouse
I've weathered the storm
From the bar room to the bedpost
I've wasted my days
All I have is my drink
And the time left to think
While time slips away 
Just look at my face
As you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye
Just walk away
And leave me alone
It's a long way back home 

Now in case you should ask me
What it is that I've done
Well I say I'm a soldier
Who once had a son
But my son doesn't know me
That's his right to choose
Oh say can you see
My best friend is me
I'm a friend I could use 

Just look at my face
As you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye
Just walk away
And leave me alone
It's a long way back home 

Now the pages have faded
The story grows cold
And the plot falls to ashes
Like the ruins of old
Those rats in my rafters
They're after my shoes
And anything else
They can find on the shelf
I've said they could use 

Just look at my face
As you tell me goodbye
You'll see what I'm after
By the look in my eye
Just walk away
And leave me alone
It's a long way back home
It's a long way back home

// Unsettled Ways //

Forgive me my unsettled ways
Don't linger in time or finger what's mine
Don't make me do
What you wouldn't do yourself 
Forgive me the bad things I do
Don't ask me to change or exchange what I am
For something else
You know that wouldn't do 

If time gets to heavy and you can no longer bear it
And you need someone to share it
Tell me girl, I'll try to make amends 

Forgive me the ways of my heart
Don't try to pretend or lend me your love
Don't ask of me
What you wouldn't ask yourself 

If time gets to heavy and you can no longer bear it
And you need someone to share it
Tell me girl, I'll try to make amends 

Forgive me my unsettled ways
Don't linger in time or finger what's mine
Don't make me do
What you wouldn't do yourself
Don't make me do
What you wouldn't do yourself

// Long Thin Dawn //

That long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 
I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

Last night I came to Denver beneath the snow-capped ridge
I thought about my darlin' as I stood beneath the bridge
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned
That any time I've wandered I always have returned 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

While climbin' up a hillside, Bill drops 'er down a gear
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can
Drivin' like the restless wind across this precious land 

Says Bill "the air is clean tonight" as he puffs a big cigar
"And if this rig keeps rollin', my boy you'll travel far
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by" 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

That long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again

// Marie Christine //

Have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot
Now have you seen the lighthouse
Oh we are close to land
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band 
Now have you seen the harbor cried Marie Christine
Have you seen the jagged rocks in the waters in between
Now have you seen the lighthouse
Oh save me if you can
For if you do I promise I'll never sail again 

Now have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched lot
Now gather all your photographs
And don your coats of blue
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine 'tis you 

When I first saw Marie Christine the woman that she was
I ssigned aboard toman her sails and honor well her cause
I christened her with old champagne
And I drove her to the west
Of all the men who sailed on her, in truth I sailed her best 

Have you seen the lighthouse shining from the rock
For the ship Marie Christine and all her gallant lot
Now have you seen the lighthouse
Oh we are close to land
Cried the brave young captain to his wretched band 

Come all ye would be sailors
All ye would be sailors
All ye would be sailors
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine 'tis you
If anyone can save us now, Marie Christine 'tis you

// Cold Hands From New York //

I came down from Albany to New York to find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside, but I was young and able
When I came out the other end, ah through the smoke the winter light was feeble
Unreadable
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go
I thanked him
A face of white a face of brown, here a smile, there a look of danger
For a stranger 
It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York 

Cold hands from New York 
A voice within you cries won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me 

I came down to live alone in New York the city of the living
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men were taking, none we giving
Or forgiving
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways
I saw them
There were men who lived in style and others who had died where no one knew them
'Cause they couldn't win
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms where babies crept unwanted
Till I began to ask myself if there was hope or if it mattered what the did
Or if they lived 

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York 

Cold hands from New York 
A voice within you cries won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me 

I came down from Albany to New York to find what I'd been missin'
I looked across the river to the city where the windows all stood glistenin'
I stood listenin'
There were prophets in the squares and people there who smiled and said forget it
There were lovers in the park and there was danger in the dark, I felt it
So afraid of it
There were preachers of the word and poets who were never heard
I heard them
There were those who would not try to learn the measure of the lie
They're livin'
I heard a young musician play in a place where they paid you not to listen
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by and offered their best wishes
That's how it is 

It was too unreal for me
I found no one who trusted me
There was no man could offer me
A cold hand from New York 

Cold hands from New York 
A voice within you cries won't someone please help me
I'll do the same for you one day
If you should ever pass my way and need me

// Affair On 8th Avenue //

The perfume that she wore was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night 
Her long flowing hair came softly undone
And it lay all around
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side
In the warmth of her love 

And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And then we played a game only she could win
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget
Then left with the answer I've never found yet 

How long, said she, can a moment like this
Belong to someone
What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die
We must almost be born
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide 

The perfume that she wore was from some little store
On the down side of town
But it lingered on long after she'd gone
I remember it well 

And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin
And then we played a game only she could win
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night

// Don't Beat Me Down //

When he was a man, my father would stand
I never saw him run
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend
And the strength of his will was the tool of his trade
And he did his work well
Till the powers that be took a liking to him
And they traded his body for a cold empty shell 
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down 

When I was a youth, I found the truth
In the eyes of a friend
There wasn't anyone could make the light dim
And we talked and we rambled and we gambled to win
And the learning was good
Till the powers that be to a liking to him
And they traded their fortunes for the sight of his blood 

When I was a child my mother smiled 
At the cradle she bought
For the little tot she held to her breast
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love
It was all that I heard
Till the powers that be took a liking to me
And they told me that love was a four-letter word 

Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got one life to live
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down 

Now I've got a place, got a worried face
And the question in mind
Please let me find a reason somehow
Why some reap the harvest while other men die
And the joker runs wild
And if powers that be take a liking to us
Then we all must return to the ways of a child
We all must return to the ways of a child 

So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
I've got something to say
Don't you stand in my way
And don't beat me down
I've got one life to life
And that's all I can give
So don't beat me down
Don't beat me down
Don't beat me down

// The Gypsy //

Step inside my tent, said she, I'd like to read you palm
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind
I'll tell you if you should quit now or if you should go on 
Then I said, now what do ya see
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
Where'll I go, what'll I be
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee 

She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake
She told me the town where I was born, she almost knew the date
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight 

Then I said, now what do ya see
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
You are so old, you are so wise
Deedlee-dum, deedlee-dy
Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
Then she spoke most quietly
Deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee 

When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot
You were told when you should speak and when you should not
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not 

Then I said, now what do ya mean
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
Where'll I go, what'll I be
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee 

Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read 

Then I said, now what do ya mean
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
Where'll I go, what'll I be
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
You are so old, you are so wise
Deedlee-dum, deedlee-dy
Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee 

Where'll I go, what'll I be
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee
You are so old, you are so wise
Deedlee-dum, deedlee-dy
Give me a sign, tell it to me
She said, deedlee-dum, deedlee-dee

// If I Could //

If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me 
If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold
Would I stand in the marketplace before
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall
And shot by the man in blue 

If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free
Would it mean anything to you 

If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time
I would turn his head away to the river
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free
For everyone to see 

If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again
To take you away from me
