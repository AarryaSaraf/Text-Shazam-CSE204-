// Bend In The Water //

Come on Pearl, come on Kitty, if you feel inclined
Down around the bend in the water, bring your fishin' line
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready, got my fishin' pole
Down around the bend in the water to the fishin' hole 
It's a fine July on a beautiful night
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay 

Down around the bend in the water, if you feel inclined
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty, I'm gonna make you mine 

All around the world tonight
What a beautiful scene below
Too fine a time to stand in line
I'm gonna take my love to go
It's a fine July and a beautiful way
For a boy and a girl to pass the time of day 

Come on Pearl, come on Kitty, if you feel inclined
Down around the bend in the water, bring your fishin' line 

All around the world tonight
What a beautiful sight below
Too fine a time to stand in line
I'm gonna take my love to go
It's a fine July on a beautiful light
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay 

Down around the bend in the water, if you feel inclined
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty, bring your fishin' line
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready, got my fishin' pole
Down around the bend in the water to the fishin' hole

// Rainy Day People //

Rainy day people always seem to know when it's time to call
Rainy day people don't talk, they just listen till they've heard it all
Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell 'ya they've been down like you
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two 

If you get lonely, all you really need is that rainy day love
Rainy day people all know there's no sorrow they can't rise above
Rainy day lovers don't love any others, that would not be kind
Rainy day people all know how it hangs on a piece of mind 

Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell you, they've been down there too
Rainy day people don't mind if you're cryin' a tear or two. 

Rainy day people always seem to know when you're feeling blue
High stepping strutters who land in the gutters sometimes need one too
Take it or leave it, or try to believe it
If you've been down too long 

Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside they just pass it on
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside they just pass it on

// Cold On The Shoulder //

All you need is time
All you need is time, time, time to make me bend 
Give it a try, don't be rude
Put it to the test and I'll give it right back to you 

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day 

Kick it around, take it to town
Try to defy what you feel inside
You better be strong
Your love belongs to us 

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day 

All I need is trust
All I need is trust, trust, trust to make it show
I don't want to know everything you done
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos 

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day 

All we need is faith
All we need is faith, faith, faith to make it nice
Kick it around, don't be rude
If you're gonna make a mistake don't you make it twice 

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day

// The Soul Is The Rock //

The soul is the rock and the rock will not be moved
Nothing is disputed, yet nothing is disproved
And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow 
Say what you like to, do what you do
Everyone's sleeping now two by two
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The sea is the space which the rock has displaced
The mind is some stranger that some soul has embraced
And somewhere between, in a no-man's land of dreams
The heart becomes the soldier yet the rock is not redeemed 

Say what you like to, do what you can
Live like a sheep, die like a lamb
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will always roll
In circles 'round the sun doing rings around the pole
When the mind is not sure what the heart will do next
The rock becomes the master and the road becomes what's left 

Late one night when the moon shone down
We went to the mill on the edge of the town
She wore white, I wore black
The town was sleeping when we got back 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will not be harmed
Though man must be cheated just as women must be charmed
And the mind is the light for the heart which cannot see
The soul becomes the stranger but the rock will always be 

Say what you like to, do what you do
Everyone's sleeping now two by two
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Oh.. Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will not be moved
Nothing is disputed yet nothing is disproved
And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow 

And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow

// Bells Of The Evening //

Bells of the evening, O sing to my love
Tell her I miss her, my own turtledove
The streets of the old town are covered with rain
I think I might never know true love again 
I'm lost with no road signs to guide me
A slave to my whiskey and dreams
Bells of the evening, O bells that I love
I've got some feelings I long to be rid of 

I'm not one to ramble; I'm not one to boast
Though I had one lover more lovely than most
She was a country girl born to be free
Who took to the city by chance there to find me 

Bells of the evening go pealin'
I'm down here listenin' to you
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her, that I'm lost and so lonely 

Bells of the evening, your sweet Sunday sound
Reminds me of the redwoods and moss covered ground
So if I should wander on back to the coast
Tell her to remember it's her I need the most 

I'm caught by the minstrel's misfortune
Of being forever displaced
Bells of the evening, O bells of the sea
Tell her that I love her; That I'm lost I'm so lonely

// Rainbow Trout //

In the name of love she came
This foolish winsome girl
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout
Swimmin' up stream in the world
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, in the name of love"
So I took her by the hand, she took me by the will
She was all dolled up like a blue eyed pup
Looking for something to spill
And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, in the name of love"

In the name of love she came
This foolish winsome girl
She was all decked out like a rainbow trout
Swimmin' upstream in the world
And she gave one flip of the rainbow tip of her tail
And she swam back down 

And she said "Please, please, I've lost my way
The current is too strong
In the name of love, kind sir I pray, in the name of love"

// A Tree Too Weak To Stand //

I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes 
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free 

The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand 

I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

// All The Lovely Ladies //

All the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could know them one by one
All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds
Strolling in to take the ladies home 
Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness
Heaven can be yours just for now. 

All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile
To everyone who cannot hold a pen
To all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains
Who dread the thought of going 'round the bend 

Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things
Heaven can be yours just for now. 

To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight
I wish that I could kiss you while you knit
To all the ones who learn to live with bein' second-guessed 
Whose job it is to give more then to get 

Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand
Heaven can be yours just for now. 

To all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last
To all the sleeping giants who must wake
To every man who answers to the letter of the law
And all the rest imprisoned by mistake 

Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass
Heaven can be yours just for now 

To all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen
To all of you with heartache that remains
Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore
If someone could relieve you of your chains 

Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea
Heaven can be yours, just for now

// Fine As Fine Can Be //

You're as soft as the rose
You're as sweet as the honey
You're as warm as the bright morning sun
You're as cool as the breeze on the last days of April
You're as fine as fine can be 
You're like time is to space
You're like faith is to trustin'
You're like blue is to feelin' unkind
You're like joy is for love,
You're like dreams are for chasin'
You're as fine as fine can be 

And when I am gone my thoughts are all with you
You're my little angel you see
You're as bright as the moon
You're as light as a feather
You're as fine as fine can be 

Like the rain is for the crops
You're like food for my thoughts
You're like true is for knowin' what's not
You're like leaves are for trees
You're like bees are for buzzin'
You're as fine as fine can be 

You're as bright as the moon
You're as light as a feather
You're as fine as fine can be

// Cherokee Bend //

His father was a man who could never understand,
the shame on the red man's face.
So they lived in the hills and they never came down,
but to trade in the white man's place.
Early in the spring when the snow had disappeared,
they came down with a bag of skins.
In the fall of the year of 1910,
daddy died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend.

Daddy didn't like what the white man said,
'bout the dirty little kid at his side.
Daddy didn't like what the white man did,
nor the deal or the way that he lied.
There was blood on the floor of the government store,
when the men took his daddy away,
but the boy stayed back till he'd come to his end,
then he run like the wind from Cherokee Bend.

Now the mother was alone and the winter was at hand,
and she prayed to her spirit kin.
It was warm in the lodge in the Kentucky hills,
on the day when the boy came in.
Then a blizzard came down and it covered up the door,
till they thought that it never would end,
and he told her the tale of the terrible affair,
in the government store down in Cherokee Bend.

Daddy didn't like what the white man said,
'bout the dirty little kid at his side,
daddy didn't like what the white man did,
nor the deal or the way that he lied.
For three long days and three long nights,
they wept and they mourned and then,
she returned to her work and her weavin',
and they tried to forget about Cherokee Bend.

Now the boy wasn't big but he hunted what he could,
and they lived for a time that way,
but the food run low and the meat  went bad,
and she said to the boy one day.
"I'm leavin' tonight and I never will return,
from the land of my spirit kin,
you must take what you need and trade what you can,
for a red man's grave down in Cherokee Bend".

It wasn't very long till she closed her eyes,
and he wrapped her in a robe,
he found her a place on the side of a hill,
and he buried her in the snow.
Early in the spring he was seen comin' down,
with his load lookin' ragged and thin.
Not a year had gone by till he stood once again,
in the government store down in Cherokee Bend.

He was ten years tall and a redskin too,
so he hadn't much face to save,
and the men sat around and they laughed and they clowned,
at the talk of a criminal's grave.
Then a man from the east didn't smile when he said,
"you're the son of that indian scum,
if you value your hide then you better abide,
by the white man's rules here in Cherokee Bend".

Daddy didn't like what the white man said,
'bout the dirty little kid at his side.
Daddy didn't like what the white man did,
nor the deal or the way that he lied.
And he spit on the floor of the government store,
and it served him to no good end,
at the close of the day they had taken him away,
to the white man's school down in Cherokee Bend.

It's been twenty one years since the boy disappeared,
where he run to nobody knows,
but they say he fell in with a man named Jim,
and he rides in the rodeos,
and they say he returns all alone to a place,
hidden deep in the Kentucky glen,
and it's pretty well known who hauled up the stone,
to the grave on the hill above Cherokee Bend.

Daddy didn't like what the white man said,
'bout the dirty little kid at his side.
Daddy didn't like what the white man did,
nor the deal or the way that he lied.
There was blood on the floor of the government store,
when the men took his daddy away,
it was 1910 and they never had a friend,
when he died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend.
It was 1910 and they never had a friend,
when he died by the rope down in Cherokee Bend.

// Now And Then //

I think this time you've said enough to make me want to leave this place
Still I keep coming back for more of the same to fan the dying flame
Here inside these walls that seem to move a little closer every day
There must be a way out of this crazy game we play out to the end
Let us just pretend a while
Think about the good things now and then 
I think this time that was the best time that we two had ever known
We tried the handle of the house upon the shore and found the open door
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam doing dances on the floor
We were only playing like two children who had stayed away from school
Two of us could not be wrong
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule 

I think this time we've learned enough to know that nothing is the same
But still the pounding of my heart hasn't changed and leavin's so strange
Here among my thoughts of you I find a gentle longing to be free
There must be a way out of this crazy game we play out to the end
Take away the in-between
Think about the good things now and then
We will see the day when you or I will stay or face up to the end
Let us just pretend a while
And think about the good things now and then

// Slide On Over //

Momma's got her long dress on
See how that little girl walks
Now we got it rollin', how're we gonna get it stopped
Momma's got something 
Daddy needs more than a lot
Now we got it rolling, how're we gonna get it stopped
Momma put your long dress on
I'd like to take that little girl to town
Now that we have rolled it, how're we gonna hold it down
Gonna slide on over to that pretty little love that I've found
Now we've got it rolling, how're we gonna hold it down 
Now momma's got her long dress on
Listen to that little girl talk
Now we got it rolling, how're we gonna get it stopped
Gonna slide on over to that funny little love that I've got
Now we got it rolling, how're we gonna get it stopped
Cause my momma's got something, daddy needs more than a lot
Now we got it rolling, how we gonna get it stopped
