// 14 Karat Gold //

If you see me smile don't think I'm acting strange
I got my just reward for all my pains
I you see me on the TV talking proud
Please understand if I don't talk too loud 
Step around and dance a bit
Polish up the dice
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll
This is my advice
Keep your mind a mystery
Runnin' hot 'n' cold
She's more than money
She's 14 Karat Gold 

If you wonder why I'm acting up this way
Gonna cash my chips I'm leavin' town today
I got more love than I could ever spend
So long, farewell, good-bye, this is the end 

Step around and dance a bit
Polish up the dice
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll
Be as cool as ice
Keep your mind a mystery
Runnin' hot 'n' cold
She's more than money
She's 14 Karat Gold 

If you get hit by the bug that bit on me
If you get caught with something soft and sweet
If you get found with something you can't waste
Then listen bud, let me give you a taste 

Step around and dance a bit
Polish up the dice
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll
This is my advice
Keep your mind a mystery
Runnin' hot 'n' cold
She's more than money
She's 14 Karat Gold 

Step around and dance a bit
Polish up the dice
Set 'em loose and let 'em roll
Be as cool as ice
Keep your mind a mystery
Runnin' hot 'n' cold
She's more than money
She's 14 Karat Gold

// In My Fashion //

In my fashion I have been a good man
I have loved and I have lost
Ever after I will be remembered
In my fashion, in my way 
There have been times, I have seen the reaper
In the bad times, and in the good
I have bent down, I have touched the ground
Saying prayers and touching wood 

In my fashion, I have been a father
I have loved and been loved in return
From the ashes, I have kept the homefires
Burning after all was said and done 

Now take a look at me
Do I look like the kind of guy
The kinda fool who went to school 
And had to stand on a stool,
Because he couldn't come t' terms with a slide rule
Take a look around again
Is it any different now than it was then 

In my fashion I have been a good man
I have loved and I have lost
And ever after I will be remembered
In my fashion, in my way

// Shadows //

Won't you reach out love and touch me
Let me hold you for awhile
I've been all around the world 
Oh how I long to see you smile
There's a shadow on the moon 
And the waters here below
Do not shine the way they should
And I love you just in case you didn't know

Let it go,
Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind
And it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me 
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door 

Won't you lie down by me baby
Run your fingers through my hands 
I've been all around the town 
And still I do not understand
Is it me or is it you 
Or the shadow of a dream
Is it wrong to be in love
Could it be the finest love I've ever seen 

Set it free,
Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind
And it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me 
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door 

Please kiss me gently darlin'
Where the river runs away
From the mountains in the springtime
On a blue and windy day
Where there's beauty all around 
As the shades of night grow deep
When the morning stars grow dim
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep 

Let it go,
Let it happen like it happened once before
It's a wicked wind
And it chills me to the bone
And if you do not believe me 
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door

// Blackberry Wine //

There's a south wind risin' and the moon shines on my window sill
I've got a feeling I might walk on over the hill
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest
And a bottle of your very best
Blackberry wine 
There's a new moon risin' and the wind sings its old song
Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share
Of a bottle of that very rare
Blackberry wine 

My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime
Try as she will she can't get me to come home on time
But I'd never cheat her or mistreat her you know
As over the mountain I go
Blackberry wine 

I'll be soft spoken
All I need is my rest
And a bottle of your very best
Blackberry wine 

Now my days are numbered and one more heel's been killed
Blackberry John left me his old recipe in his will
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some time
And a bottle of your very fine
Blackberry wine 

Blackberry wine,
You know that I'm quite dry without you
Blackberry wine

// Heaven Help The Devil //

In this land of chance do we know right from wrong
Even at a glance we know the road is long
We don't owe a single thing to anyone 
Most of us do not believe in come what may
Everything we fought for was in vain they say
Even when called upon to throw our lives away 

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories 

In these times of trial and uncertainty
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy 

Our love for each other may not be explained
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain 

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories 

To every unsung hero in the universe
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth
To all good men of reason may they never thirst 

We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea
And faith that will remain through all eternity
We try to be helpful to the ones in need 

We have been captured by the thieves of the night
Held for ransom if you please
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories

// Thank You For The Promises //

Thank you for the promises we make
I know I can't complain
I think I did all right
No failures are in sight
Only now and then
I'd like to reminisce
Do you remember when 
Even if we're angels we can't ask 
To wander through the past
The future is our goal
The night is black as coal
If I could pay the price
I'd like to love you once
I'd love to love you twice 

Thanks
We cannot say enough
The road is sometimes rough
But we can get along
The going will get tough 
But we won't be afraid 
Of the promises we made 

Thank you for the promises you keep
When I am fast asleep
To be where we belong
Is all that I can ask
We can do it in the shade
As long as I have you
And the promises we made 

Thank you for the promises we break
If you made a clean mistake
Well that's what love's about
No need to stand and shout
The truth is in your eyes
The answer lies within
No need to criticize 

Thanks 
For the promises at hand
The abuse that we must stand
Is often heaven sent
They may not pay the rent
You never can be sure
When promises get bent 

Thank you for the promises that live
This is all that I can give
Forever in my mind 
To leave the past behind
And seal it with a kiss
Forever in my soul
I will remember this

// Baby Step Back //

Now it looks to me like the same old place,
in the sky it looks like rain.
The same old town with the same old streets,
my address has not changed.
You can find me there with the door shut tight, 
and the one wish that remains.

Baby step back, baby step back, 
either step up or step back.

Now you know I don't write no bad checks,
I have no wish to repent.
I've seen a few but whatever I do,
I don't cause no accidents.
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time,
I don't leave no evidence.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.

Still I don't kneel down I was born to fight,
so you best leave me alone.
Maybe I'll get much more than I need,
or much less than I should own,
last of all let me say it again,
either step up or step on.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby walk back, baby walk back,
either walk on or walk back.

Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.
Baby walk back, baby walk back,
either walk on or walk back.
Baby step back, baby step back,
either step up or step back.

// All I'm After //

All I'm after is to be on your winning side
All I need is to be turning back the tide
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess 
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day 

All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through
This is just a guess but I must confess
It feels better being certain
Please excuse my truthfulness
What I'm seeing's worth believing
When you thrill me like you do
So you wonder why my feelings never fade
I think I got it made 

In the evening when the rain begins to fall
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all
But you sound so sad, in your special way
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways
Ain't it funny how life changes every day

// Triangle //

Oh the gist of it all is the first day of fall is the day when my ship will set sail
The best of all friends will say good-bye again there's still time for one last glass of ale
We'll sail away proudly, our backs to the wall on a southwind and lots of good cheer
And when we've looked over the white cliffs of Dover, We'll be in Bahama next year
From Bermuda on down the Triangle around us will teach us a lesson or two
There's many a mate who unevenyly stated the course he had charted was true
"Don't worry 'bout me," he said "Go down below, give a certified sailor a turn,
Just sip on your rum or I'll give you my thumb and say, son you got something t' learn!" 
It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip from an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of the dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight I might have her at my fingertips 

Oh the best of all things is the first day of spring when when the water runs heavy and fast
The mermaids have all gone to Davy Jones' Ball
And it seems their first trip was their last
They had so much fun
They don't wish to return
to the beach where they lay all day long
They'd rather stay under
And boy it's no wonder
When all the rock lobsters roll on
It's a mighty fine way to be found 

Triangle Triangle 
Oh see my ship dangle
We're bound for Bahama my friend
Like lovers like danger
Like babies like mangers
But that's where my storybook ends
Like soldiers of fortune, believers in God
And all kings without crosses to bear
All sweepers and cleaners
with no misdemeanors
Should try the triangle out there 

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found
So hand me my grip
From an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight 
I might have her at my fingertips 

When she took her last tumble
The sea bottom rumbled
There was no confusion or blame
The captain said "Men we must answer again to the sea so ye may not complain"
And as they lay sleeping down there in the deep
With their faces turned up to the stars
A tuna fish turned
To a mermaid in bed and said 
"There goes another sandbar" 

It's a mighty hard way to come down
And a mighty fine way to be found 
So hand me my grip 
From an old sailing ship
Put the kiss of the dawn on my lips
With some luck tonight
I might have her at my fingertips

// I'll Do Anything //

Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today
I'd never leave you
I'll do anything that you say
I've been around some walking on the down street
Feeling as low as the soles on the shoes of my feet
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway 
Many's the time I've wished that I were free
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see
I'd never leave you
I'll do anything that you say
Whenever the thought seems better off left alone
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway 

I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say
Try to believe me, I'll do anything that you say
Though it might never grieve me, I'll do anything that you say
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say

// She's Not The Same //

Ah the living ain't easy
With all of these false emotions
Too little devotion
And I'm tired of just
Being alone, she's just not the same
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain 
Like any good gambler
I was chained to a wishing well
I keep wishing in vain
But listen friend
Don't look now, she's right behind you
Looking for someone to take her inside
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride 

I'm a little uneasy
And there ain't much pride inside me
She don't know how it hurts
And I'm telling you
It's too late now, she's not the same
She's a red hot kid, she's a crying shame 

Anytime is the right time
To get on with a new tomorrow
But I could never let yesterday go
And when the falling rain makes me sad
She comes to me in the dreams I've had
In the morning light, in the dead of night 

Ah the lovin' ain't easy
An' I let it get the best of me
She don't know how it hurts
And I'm telling you
It's too late now, she don't talk no more
She don't make me feel like she did before
There's too much wait and too much give and take 

I'm a little uneasy
And there ain't much pride inside me
She don't know how it hurts
And I'm telling you it's
Too late now, she's just not the same
It's too late now, she's not the same
It's too late now, she's not the same
