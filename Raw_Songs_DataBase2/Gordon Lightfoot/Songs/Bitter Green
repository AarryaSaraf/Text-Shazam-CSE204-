Upon the Bitter Green she was
The hills above the town
Echoed to the footsteps
As soft as heather down
Waiting for her master
To kiss away her tears
Waiting through the years

Bitter Green they called her
Walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter Green they called her
Waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Some say he was a sailor
Who died away at sea
Some say he was a prisoner
Who never was set free
Lost upon the ocean
He died there in the mist
Dreaming of her kiss

Bitter Green they called her
Walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter Green they called her
Waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

But now, that Bitter Green is gone
The hills have turned to rust
There comes a weary stranger
His tears fall in the dust
Kneeling by the churchyard
In the autumn mist
Dreaming of her kiss

Bitter Green they called her
Walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter Green they called her
Waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone to take her home

Bitter Green they called her
Walking in the sun
Loving everyone that she met
Bitter Green they called her
Waiting in the sun
Waiting for someone
To take her home
