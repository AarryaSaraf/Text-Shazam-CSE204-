I come to this garden
I come here to rest
Early each day upon risin'
I think of my lost love
From over the sea
And sometimes I've wondered
If she thinks of me 
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart 

There's peace in the garden
There's peace in the air
Peace in the sound of the river
There's peace in the meadow
The sun shines like gold
And if she were with me
There'd be peace in my soul 

I long to return to the place, I remember
The taste of her lips close to mine
I could do much better
If I could be strong
Come into my garden
But leave me alone 

I come to this garden
I come here to rest
Just as the night comes stealin'
Someone is weeping
She's calling my name
Deep in the garden
Deep in my brain 

I long to recall every kiss, every kind word
I miss her so much I could die
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart
But the creatures of evil
Have captured her heart
And that same old obsession
Still keeps us apart
