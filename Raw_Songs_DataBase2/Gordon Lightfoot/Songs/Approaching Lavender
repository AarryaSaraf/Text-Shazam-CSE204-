If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching lavender
You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure
You'll never be the same
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding lavender
Then you must be very sure
That life is not a game 
You might even learn a thing or two approaching lavender
You'll soon be on a one night tour
Forgetting your own name
You won't need a reason just to be alone with lavender
For the light so warm and pure
Will draw you like a flame 

The colors that surround you there will be the shade of lavender
Shadows dancing everywhere
Like flowers in the rain
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to lavender
With words you never spoke before
And will not speak again 

Oh sweet lavender I understand you perfectly
There is no way that I can see
You living by yourself
Oh sweet lavendar I must be with you constantly
Your presence means so much to me
Much more that life itself 

Oh sweet lavender as fragrant as the name you bear
Please cast away the clothes you wear
And give your love to me
Oh sweet lavender your smile is like the golden sun
I'd love to see you laugh and run
As naked as the sea 

If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching lavender
Don't try and get the best of her
She will not share the blame
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding lavender
Then you must be very sure
That life is not a game
There is no shame
