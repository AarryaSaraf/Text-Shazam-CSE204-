I spent most of my life outside in the drivin' rain
I was only trying to get my with some of life's amenities
Well nothin's free
I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see
I can't depend on love to defend me 
It took most of my time to do what never was done
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone
Come right or wrong
It was laid to rest that way
I hate to be unkind
Pretending is for strangers who don't know you 

I spent most of my life outside in the drivin' rain
I was in some one-horse town just waitin' for a plane to take me back
Now where's that at
I paid the price, well ain't that nice
Knowin' I'm so free
I can't depend on love to defend me
I got more than I bargained for
Now it's plain to see
I can't depend on love to defend me
