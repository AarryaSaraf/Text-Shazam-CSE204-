The way I feel is like a robin
whose babes have flown to come no more
like a tall oak tree alone and cryin'
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare 
Now a woman Lord is like a young bird
and the tall oak tree is a young man's heart
among his boughs you'll find her nesting
when the nights are cool she's warm and dry 

Your coat of green it will protect her
her wings will grow your love will too
But all too soon your mighty branches
will cease to hold her and she'll fly from you 

Now the way I feel is like a robin
whose babes have flown to come no more
like a  tall oak tree alone and cryin'
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare
