Just like birds of a feather
We too have followed the golden sun
It feels so good, 
Knowin' the watchman's gone 
If I give you a rose, buddy
Would you please bury it in the fields?
I seen a rose
Watchin' it all fold out 

There's a train down at the station
It's come to carry my bones away
Two engines on
Twenty-one coaches long
End to end
Twenty-one coaches bend
The watchman's out
Kickin' the bums about 

If I wait for the right moment
You can bet I'll climb aboard unseen
I've done it before
I know I can do it in my sleep 

The watchman's out
Kickin' the bums about
The watchman's out
Kickin' your dreams about 

As I leave you in the sunset
Got one more nothin' I'd like to say
"You don't know me
A son of the sea am I"
As I say to you, my brother
If you live to follow the golden sun
You better beware
Knowin' the watchman's always there 

If you find me feedin' daisies
Please turn my face up to the sky
And leave me be
Watchin' the moon roll by
Whatever I was
You know it was all because
I've been on the town
Washin' the bullshit down 

The watchman's out
Kickin' your dreams about
It feels so good
Knowin' the watchman's gone
It's like a song
Knowin' the watchman's gone
