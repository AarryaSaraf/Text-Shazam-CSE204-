Another lazy mornin'
No need to get down on anyone
My son
Coffee's in the kitchen
Woman on the run
No need to get bothered
I'll think about Monday
When Monday comes
It's two for one
Mister hoot 'n holler
Gotta make a dollar
Another lazy mornin'
I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two
The most delicious brew
Keepin' up with the Joneses
I hope no one telephones us 
I'd take a place in the country
But for now the old back yard
Looks to me like fifty acres
Of the roundest ground in town 

Another lazy mornin'
Come suppertime I'm gonna light my barbecue
Nothin' new
Only that she loves me
And nothin' I know can change me
No need to get bothered
I do more livin' than it might seem
Some dream
Livin' like a pauper
Bless my darlin' daughter 

I'd like to know what makes a man go
Over land and sea
I guess it must get kinda lonesome
That's the way I used to be 

Another lazy mornin'
No need to get down on anyone
Such fun
Coffee's in the kitchen
Woman on the run
