When I woke this mornin', something inside of me told me this would be my day
I heard the morning train, I felt the wind change, too many times I'm on my way
Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain

And then I saw the sunrise above the cotton sky like a candycane delight
I saw the milkman, I saw the business man, I saw the only road in sight
Then I got to thinkin' what makes you want to go, to know the wherefore and the why

So many times now, oh lord I can't remember if it's september or july

Then all at once it came to me, I saw the wherefore, and you can see it if you try
It's in the sun above, it's in the one you love, you'll never know the reason why

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain
So much to lose, so much to gain
