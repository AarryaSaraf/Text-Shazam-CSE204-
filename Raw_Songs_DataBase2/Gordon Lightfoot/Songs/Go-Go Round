Alone upon the sidewalks of despair
'Twas there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care 
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there 
And the band was groovin' 
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time
He would mistreat her 

In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew
She would be his loved one 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere 

He's playin' up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone
The song was ended 

But as she walks, she waits for him the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart she knows there is no way
She can hope to change him 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care 
A go-go girl in love
