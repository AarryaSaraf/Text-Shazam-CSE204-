Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do
Forget about music and alcohol to
Forget about yer baby, we've got other work for you
Better drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to rise 'n shine
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for 
It was back in '39 when I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence and the world had turned to cold
Drink yer glasses empty now was all that they were told
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's no time to wonder why 

We'd love to take life over, that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie to remind us once again
Better drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to hit the line
You got one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's a tear in every eye 

I'd like to take things one at a time
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal, or borrow you got another hill to climb
So drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's no time to wonder why 

We'd like to take life over again
When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie to remind us of the planes
Just drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to rise 'n shine
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
