Poor little Allison
Standing in the night wind
Wishing out loud
Turning her face to the summer rain
Poor little Allison
Never had much goin'
Hard to forget
Always in step with the world she's in 
Never knowin' never feelin'
Showin' so much pride
Never sayin' what she's thinkin'
Or feelin' deep inside 

Poor little Allison
Dreaming of the right one
Laughing out loud
Lost in a crowd of fair weather friends 

Never knowin' never feelin'
Showin' so much pride
Never sayin' what she's thinkin'
Or feelin' deep inside 

Poor little Allison
Standing in the night wind,
Wishing out loud
Turning her face to the summer rain
Hard to forget
Always in step with the world she's in
