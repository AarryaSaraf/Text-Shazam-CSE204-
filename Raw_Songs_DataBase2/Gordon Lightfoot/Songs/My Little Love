I've got a song that it is my mind, my little love who is never unkind
I'm a poet and I'm better off dead. These are the words she said 
Down by the breadline pickin' up dough, hand me the guitar, there I'll go
I would rather make a living instead, instead of bein' in the red 

My little love from the world outside, helpin' me keep, turnin' the tide
Come and meet me by the neon light. And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love 

My little love movin' in my soul, my little love who will never turn cold
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, it doesn't matter if I ain't behaved 

My little love you been on my side, helpin' me keep turnin' the tide
Havin' a hard time livin' right now, havin' a hard time showin' ya how 

My little love from the world out there, helpin' me keep a-doin' my share
Come and meet me by the neon light, And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love 

Down by the breadline pickin' up dough, hand me the guitar, there I'll go
It doesn't matter if I ain't shaved, it doesn't matter if I ain't behaved 

I got a light that is in my soul, I got a love that'll never turn cold
Come and meet me by the neon light. And I'm hopin' you'll make it alright 

I'll do anything you see fit, my little love
I'll do anything you see fit, my little love
