Album: 9thWalnut

// Ride The Wild //

You messed around with all my friends and everyone you see
But you're trying to ride the wild when you mess around with me
And all my friends tell me they see you out on the town
They all look down upon you with some pity and a frown

Bankshot baby, I saw through your eyes
I see you run around with a thousand other guys
Tell them all your newly thought up lies

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't show some love for me then I don't want to see you
Girl, you got me runnin', why can't you see?

Now lately when I wake, it's on the wrong side of the bed
And I know your voice distinctly, it reverberates in my head
And all my friends tell me they see you out on the town
Tryin' to ride the wild, but the words been passed around

Ride the wild, baby, you like to ride all night
Ride the wild, baby, I'm sure you're not so tired
Come on, baby, now give me a try

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't trust a liar, then I don't want to trust you
Girl, you got me running, why can't you see?

Ride the wild, baby, you like to ride all night
Ride the wild, baby, I'm sure you're not so tired
Come on, baby, now give me a try

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't trust a liar, then I don't want to trust you
Girl, you got me running

// It's a Hectic World //

It's a hectic world, making me a nervous wreck
It's a hectic world, wish I had no intellect

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race

Hey!
You!

Try to get ahead is what I'm supposed to do
No matter what I do, I gotta get ahead of you

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race

// Sailor's Choice //

Red, white, black and yellow, I just yellow
I just yellow, I just yellow

I'm degenerate, I just yellow
I'm no hippie, no, no, I just yellow

Nothing you can do and nothing you can say
Is gonna make me change my way

'Cause I just yellow, I just yellow
I just yellow, I just yellow

I just yellow on the phone
I just yellow and don't get stoned
No, I just yellow, I just yellow

// Crepe Suzette //

Give me a chance, I'd shoot you
Give me a chance, baby
You'd see what I could do to you
You look pretty nice, so good, even kind
But I'm sure that you would dump me
And then not even look behind

But that's the way you are
Impossible to change
I'd kill you right now
But you're a little out of range

Give me a chance, I'd shoot you
Give me a chance, baby
You'd see what I could do to you
You know what I could do
You saw what I could do to you

But that's the way you are
Impossible to change
I'd kill you right now
But you're a little out of range

Let's go

// You Make Me Sick //

You make me sick with your pretty face
Can't stand you stinkin' up the whole place
Don't want to see you out on the street
I hope we never meet

'Cause you make me sick
You make me sick
You make me sick

You're in the magazines, you're on TV
If there's money, then that's where you'll be
Don't be nice to me, don't even try
I hate your guts, and I'll tell you why

'Cause you make me sick
You make me sick
Yeah, you make me sick

// Lullaby //

Cute little lullaby
It's time for you to come outta there
Cute little lullaby
You know people are just gonna stare

'Cause they know what you've been through
They know everything you do
And they know about your lies
And they know that you've not got
One fucking thing to hide

Cute little lullaby
It's time for you to come outta there
Cute little lullaby
You know people are just gonna stare

'Cause they know that you're a whore
They know what you've got in store
And they know about your lies
And they know that you've not got
One fucking thing to hide

// Nightage //

I'm upset, she don't know why
She don't know why I'm so high
I'm depraved, too far gone to save
She is fast, I will never last

I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night

She is playing with my heart
She is playing with my heart
But that's the way it goes

I'm depressed, she don't know why
Wanting more than a ticket can buy
I'll go in, and face reality
Watch her burn, but the fire is in me

I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night

She is playing with my heart
She is playing with my heart

But that's the way it goes
The way it is
The way it goes
Don't you know

// Baby Doncha Know //

The world passes by, but I have not yet realized
We both know it's you that I cannot recognize

So you come up to me, asking me to assist you
But baby doncha know I've already been told
And I'm really through with you
And I really hate you

You're getting older and you always try to look young
But baby doncha know your best has already been done

So you come up to me, asking me to assist you
But baby doncha know I've already been told
And I'm really through with you
And I really hate you

Do you know what you're gonna do with yourself?
I guess not

// Tired Of Being Tired //

Tired of being tired, bored of being bored
Tired of being stared at, tired of being ignored
By you

Tired of being sick, sick of being sane
You're so stupid, you don't know it's gonna rain
On you

I don't know what I'm gonna do
Guess I have to get away from you

Tired of being tired, bored of being bored
Tired of being stared at, tired of being ignored
By you
By you
By you

// I'm Shaky //

Last night, I made love to my radio
Last night, I curled up in bed with my canary

Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
It sure was fun, I guess I'm pretty weird
To you, to you
To you, to you

But we're all weird down deep inside
And we're all strange, indeed
Why is it so? The parts we hide
In order to keep our foolish pride

Last night, I gave head to my microphone
Last night, I curled up in bed with my canary

Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
It sure was fun, I guess I'm pretty weird
To you, to you
To you, to you

But we're all weird down deep inside
And we're all strange, indeed
Why is it so? The parts we hide
In order to keep our foolish pride

// Grudge //

Grudge, it works like a gun
Shoot it at people to make them hurt
Grudge, it works like a gun
Shoot it at people to make them hurt

Mad enough to look back at you
Mad enough to shoot back at you
Mad enough to look back at you
Mad enough, I've had enough of
Grudge
Grudge

Now I got a grudge on you, yeah
I got a grudge on you, yeah
I got a grudge on you, yeah
I got a grudge on you, yeah
I got a grudge on you, yeah

Grudge, it works like a gun
Shoot it at people to make them hurt
Grudge, it works like a gun
Shoot it at people to make them hurt

Mad enough to look back at you
Mad enough to shoot back at you
Mad enough to look back at you
Mad enough, I've had enough of
Grudge
Grudge
Grudge
Grudge

// Mohicans //

About three years ago, you know
They said rock and roll was too slow, so it's gotta go
Then a couple of blokes said they don't wanna toke
And they made some noise on their electric toys
They had a lot of fun, the world was stunned
They said, "New wave, man"
And that's when punk began

Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans

And if you cut your hair a certain way
Then you're in the game, and you're gonna play
Playing

Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans

// To Remember //

Stumbled in last night
My head was still throbbing
Then I remembered

Ah, the things I said to you
I didn't mean it
I didn't want to say it
So I ask your forgiveness
Just give me one kiss

To remember
The way we were
To remember
The things I said
To remember
To remember you

Oh, I want you to know
That I feel for you
And I want you to know
That I walk with you
And I want you to see

To remember
The way we were
To remember
The things I said
To remember
To remember you

// Yore Disgusting //

Yore disgusting, like the hind of a dog
Yore disgusting, you know you look like a hog
Yore disgusting, you know you always were
Yore disgusting, subhuman, that's for sure

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place
Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place

Yore disgusting, take a look you might find it
Yore disgusting, pretty rough and crude
Yore disgusting, and I don't want see you

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face

Yore disgusting, take a look you might find it
Yore disgusting, pretty rough and crude
Yore disgusting, and I don't want see you

// It's My Hair //

Gotta clean, gotta shine
Gotta weep, gotta whine
Got a good piece of ass
Down on Sunset and Vine
You gotta come on me, bitch
And stop all this fuckin' around
And you gotta somehow please stop
Before you let go and become loose
Like how you are from my hand
And I just hope you're real good
'Cause you gotta take care
Don't you ever dare fare
And take good care, a real good air
And lay 'em bare there without a stare
A stare from anywhere 'cause it's my hair
It's my hair, it's my hair
And I'll do what I want

Gotta clean, gotta shine
Gotta weep, gotta whine
Got a good piece of ass
Down on Sunset and Vine
You gotta come on me, bitch
And stop all this fuckin' around
And you gotta somehow please stop
Before you let go and become loose
Like how you are from my hand
And I just hope you're real good
'Cause you gotta take care
Don't you ever dare fare
And take good care, a real good air
And lay 'em bare there without a stare
A stare from anywhere 'cause it's my hair
It's my hair, it's my hair
And I'll do what I want

// I Need Some //

There will never be another one just like her
Nobody comes close, and that's for sure
I need someone to see me through
Not just anybody, I need you

'Cause I need someone about your age
Other girls, they wanna play games
Gimme a kiss girl, 'cause that's what I need
Gimme some lovin'

A girl that won't hesitate, yeah

See that girl, she's so fine
Take a good stare, she's gonna be mine
A little bit close, a little bit snug
She's the woman I want to hug

'Cause I need someone, I need someone

I need someone, I need someone
I need someone

A girl that won't hesitate, yeah
