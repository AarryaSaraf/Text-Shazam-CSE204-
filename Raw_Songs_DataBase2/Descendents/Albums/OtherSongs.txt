// Like The Way I Know //

When I walk down the street people can't resist to stare 
I don't exist and I'm not really there 
Tired and sick I wanna get outta here 
'Cause the people round here don't like the way I know 

They don't like the way I know 

Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know

Getting scared I wanna get outta here 
'Cause people round here don't like the way I know 

They don't like the way I know 

Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know

// Gotta //

Money, it'll feed my tummy
But it, will never feed my soul
Where my soul should me
There's a hole in me
I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem

Funny, when you got no money
Then your, time is not your own
Where my time should be, there's only drudgery
I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem

Gotta have a reason to get out of my bed
I never want to feel my life's been wasted
Makin money, it'll feed my tummy
But it, will never feed my soul
When my soul should be
There's a hole in me

I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem
Gotta have a fantasy

Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem to me

// Lucky //

Walking home on St. Patty's Day
I found a lucky penny along the way
Put it in my pocket
The one with the hole in it
These days things don't seem to go my way

I know it's tough sometimes to be with me
When I'm predicting rain most every day
Lately I've been right, almost every time
These days things don't seem to go my way

What would I do, if I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you

So I keep telling myself something's going to change
Maybe I'll get lucky then I can smile again
Cause that's what I want to do
I want a smile for you
I'm waiting for some things to go my way

What would I do, If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
Fuck St. Patty's Day
I'm throwing my pennies away
But I'm holding on to a single lucky charm
That's what I want to do
I want a smile for you
I'm waiting for some things to go my way

What would I do, If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't found you what would I do?
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't-a wouldn't-a couldn't-a, what would I do
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you

// Original Me //

Mirror, mirror please believe 

I need to find a sign 

All of my life's spent wondering 

Whose hiding behind this face of mine 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 


I need a sign, a simple chime 

A windblown kiss across my mind 

Solitude in the craziness 

Of a world gone mad, a world behind 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me 


Chance the day and spring a laugh 

Don't stray off the beaten path 

Mental prostitution 

In this universal institution 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 

Confession, agression, my time to end the session 

One bang and I'm free 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me.

// Sad State Of Affairs //

It's such a sad state of affairs, and I don't care
A sad state of affairs
It's such a sad state of affairs – I don't care

Look at things long enough until they go away
But they're still there, aren't they?
And each little insect doesn't make me angry
And the dirt in the sink gets washed down the drain

It's such a sad state of affairs, and I don't care
A sad state of affairs
This place could use a little repair – I don't care

The TV on the table says listen to me hum
I sit on the sofa with my mind all numb
And each little murderer doesn't make me angry
And the dirt in the sink gets washed down the drain

Follow the flow, wherever it goes
Down the drain, and everything's clean
Follow the flood, where is the blood?
Washed away, away from the scene

Use your time and memorize the lullaby of the day
Process the data and throw it away
And each little question doesn't get me thinking
And the lies of my life still buzz around my brain

// Shattered Milo //

I looked in her eyes but I can see 

My place in her's a mystery 

Struggle, as I try to say 

The words I know she won't believe 

Growing tired, of this game 

I must know, what she wants from me 

Oh and what, does she say 


Well I'm beginning to wonder 

I'm beginning to doubt 

What kind a spell are you under 

I can't figure you out 


Keep your eyes away from me, 

Leave alone that's what I need 

Now don't touch me 

Don't look me in the eye 

Stay at least a foot away 

The more I want, the more I sweat 

The more I blow everything I say 

You may think I'm bitching now 

But you'll find out who I really am some day 


Why don't you give me a sign 

Walk with me, smile, just let me know 

Do you like my act? 

And am I putting on a good show 


Cause that's all you'll get from me 

What am I like? 

Even I don't know 

They call me a fucking Milo 


Well I don't see the attraction 

Your not telling the truth 

I don't give satisfaction 

And I won't play those games with you

I think you're getting to close to me 

Leave alone that's what I need 


My mind, is my saving grace 

My cage, my hiding place, 

My mind, helps me chose the fate 

Today a man felt self disgrace 

My mind, I wish it could erase 

I've erased 


Everything but your face 

Leave your face 

Oh not a trace 

Except your face 

Your face 

Your face

// Silver //

First fear can I make all day
Silver melts like a glass of ice
Silver born you were led a stray
Memories control his future

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
This time, I feel shy, won't melt into myself

First time, for everything my sacred view
Don't think on anything, it's all in your head
I still want your lies

A first fear can I make all day
Silver melts like a glass of ice
Silver born you were led a stray
I will reserve this fast
First fear, it felt okay
First time for everything
Your friends were still in my face
Oh I will not turn away

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
And I, and I, won't melt into myself
And all I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
And I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

First time for everything, my sacred view
Don't think on anything it's all in your head
(Or anything) not any more drugs
More silver, silver, silver gone blue

Third week I start a new
Silver me, instead of blue
I feel a shiver on my face
But it's just another cold sweat

And I, and I, won't melt into myself
And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
Well I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
Well I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

And I wish I could tell you
I wish I could be with you again
And I wish I could hold you
Well I'll see ya, I'll see
I've lost another friend

Next time when I see the van
Next time I'll feel my love
Give it back my innocence
Give it back my dignity
Throwing out the innocent
Throwing out the human heart
All I fool there is to this
And all my silver begins to glow

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
And I, and I, won't melt into myself
Well I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
Well I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

First year, can I let it bleed

Don't think on anything, its all in your head
The words you like
Are silver, silver, silver, silver, silver

// That's The Breaks //

You asshole Twitter troll
Go home, asshole Twitter troll
Go, fucking twit
We are not impressed with you
Fucking twit
Crawl back to your hole of hate
Your hole of hate

You asshole Twitter troll
Go home, asshole Twitter troll
Go, fucking twit
Caught in a bold-faced lie again
Fucking twit
Small mind, small hands, small everything
Small everything

You asshole Twitter troll
Go home, asshole Twitter troll
Go home
