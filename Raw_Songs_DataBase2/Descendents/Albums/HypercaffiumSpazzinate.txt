Album: HypercaffiumSpazzinate

// Feel This //

Busted heart, my brain is beat, yeah
Don't want a doctor
Need zero anesthetic to make me numb
Escape is easy and everybody's offering

I wanna feel this
Gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this
So I can kick this sickness
The only way to get my mind around it

Busted brain, my heart is beat, yeah
Don't want a bottle
Or well-intended smiles and lies
Escape is easy and everybody's offering

I wanna feel this
Gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this
So I can kick this sickness
Wanna take pain straight the way I found it
Can't get around it
Can't heal without it

// Victim Of Me //

I just quit this joke of a life plan
It won't get me nowhere, no
I'm a fear driven service robot
A spectacle of a man with no options

No further will I travel 
Aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be 
A victim of me

Complain about everything in my life
And blame everybody I know
I make every decision laced in panic
Regrettable, but I know it's amendable

No further will I travel 
Aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be 
A victim of me

I don't have to run from me
Just turn away
And be satisfied
And I'm not going to fight with me
Just turn away
And stop wandering aimlessly

Yeah I'm not going to choose to be
A victim of me
I'm not going to let myself be
A victim of me

// On Paper //

I'm not so easy on the eye
It's been said my face can make an onion cry
I mean no harm, but I've got the charm
Of a murdering serial raper
I never get none, and I know why
But there's more to me than meets the eye
The real live me ain't certified
But I look good on paper

Statistically I'm far above the rest
I do my homework, never have to guess
My social life's an empty wreck
Romance is an alien labor
There are things about me you'll never know
Unless you scratch the surface and look below
My resume is solid gold
I look good on paper

I got straight A's on every test
A perfect credit score
My ledgers never in the red
I look good on paper

I never get none, and I know why
But there's more to me than meets the eye
If you got the time I'm qualified
I look good on paper
I look good on paper
I look good 
On paper
On paper

// Shameless Halo //

Shameless halo
I think you forgot love along the way
Shameless halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?

I know what your prophet meant
But every time you vent
Sweet honey turns to poison
Sweet honey turns to poison

Shameless halo
You believe in heaven, why are you so afraid?
Shameless halo
There's a victim card that you play
When you don't get your way
You judge other peoples choices
You'd silence different voices

Shameless Halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?
You call it the book of love
You're swinging it like a club
Sweet honey turns to poison
I watch what you say and do
I can't stand the tone of your tune
Sweet honey turns to poison
Sweet honey turns to poison

// No Fat Burger //

Can't have no more juicy burgers
Can't have no more greasy fries
Doctor took my lipid profile
He told me I'm barely alive

No more fat
No more fat
No more chicken pot pies, no more chorizo
I can't have that

Got this problem from my father
Grandpa died at 45
Heart attack and a triple bypass
Future's looking very bright

No more fat
No more fat
No more apple fritters, no more ice cream
I can't have that
No more fat
No more fat
I like food, but all the food that tastes good…
I can't have that

// Testosterone //

Need it bad, someone gimme a dose
Need it bad, testosterone
I'm not God… I wanna be one
[x2]

Good things don't come to those who wait
They only come to those who take
I waited so long to have my chance
They told me I didn't have what it takes
So slam it right here in my vein

Need it bad, someone gimme a dose
Need it bad, testosterone
I'm not God… I wanna be one

So gimme more – no, gimme all of those
I want the lion's share… I know
I'm not God… I just wanna be one, yeah

And all you fuckin' dicks who beat your chest
Don't even think that I'm impressed
But they're trying to take my wife,
My life, my job, so…
Right now I need something for my brain
Right now I need to go insane
Insane

Need it now

// Without Love //

Long years waiting for it
Lost pages given to disease within me
Long days fighting for it
Lost years left praying for relief from sickness
Then madness
 
Life won't wait for us
And love won't heal itself
Let's find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
Another year goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
 
Shock faded, no one passed away
We live to fight a million days… in silence
Dark pages no one has to see
Lock every door around us in self-defense
We conceal this
 
Life won't wait for us
And love won't heal itself
Let's find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
A life just passing by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
 
We let it down… gave in to infatuation
We tore it down by giving way to blind temptation
But I know there's a reason
We've gotta believe it's true
And find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
Our final chance to try
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love

Can't live without love
Can't live without love

// We Got Defeat //

Yeah the world just kicked my ass again
Old news, it's the same way it's ever been

Just like before
Sprawling senseless
To the floor
With no defenses

Don't have the time to be angry
I'll use my mind, find out how they beat me

Not like before
I'll learn some new tricks
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time

Winning never taught anybody anything
Underdogs get the bone eventually

Not like before
I think I got this
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time

// Smile //

I can see your pain has left you locked up, beat down
I can see the fear has made you desperate, burnt out

Too much regret and shattered hope
Sent you slipping down that slope
All I can do is lend a hand
Be a friend again
And it's ok if you want to vent, but…

What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while

I can feel the bitterness that drains you, poisons you
And all those grass-is-greener thoughts, I'm telling you, they're killing you

You're not a have-not, can't you see
What you've got's so important to me
Measuring your life versus theirs
You'll always come out ahead
In all the ways that really matter, so…

What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Oh what I wouldn't, wouldn't
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while

I can see your pain has left you locked up, beat down, desperate, burnt out
I'm telling you, it's killing you, killing you, killing you

I can see your pain
There's nothing I can say except

Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played

// Limiter //

They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all

Back then, everybody knew a spaz or two
We never thought those kids were bad, did you?
These days, everybody's found another way
Just give 'em a pill and send 'em on their way

But whatever happened to drug-free youth?
What's to become of our sons, what can we do?

Cause they gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
Limiter, limiter
Are you limited for life?
Society don't want to see

They drug you for this, and then they drug you for that
'Til you don't even know where your head is at
School's the pusher - we don't even have a choice
So what is the future of the limited boys?

Shame on all of us if they're hooked for good
I'd fix you by myself, if I only could

They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
I'm so sorry, son
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see

// Fighting Myself //

On the run since before ever after
Standard family disaster
Lovers, brothers, other bastards
Told me where to go
I shook my lumps, then took off running
Short on wisdom, wits, or cunning
One for all, but all for nothing
Into the unknown

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

I tried to drown your memory
It learned to swim and clung to me
Kissed my cheek sadistically
And dragged me down below

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

I was so angry then, in psychic self-defense
Wasting energy, fighting something I couldn't see…
Just fightin' myself

I know time unfolds and then it tangles
Strings attached and feelings mangled
Some threads are severed, some still dangle
Some just drift away

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

The last thing I tried to do was end up hurting you
I found my enemy staring back from the mirror at me
I've been fightin' myself
Fightin' myself

There's nobody in the ring but me
I broke some things I know just can't be fixed
While I fought for what I wanted more than anything
You stuck around for kicks

// Spineless And Scarlet Red //

Scarlet red is all that's left of us
A room where no honesty remains
Still farther fetched is our return to grace
Though I'd give anything to turn back these idle hands of shame

So let the rain come down, let the lightning fly
Rest assured, your stars won't have the answers
Erosion therapy, all that's left of you and me
Falling down and hiding all the ways that we've gone wrong

Let's watch the people point and stare at us today
You know we've brought this on ourselves
They'll see us crumble as we count the many ways
You left us spineless and scarlet red… scarlet red

Both found complicit in this mess we've made
Intruders lay with us in bed
Rabid yet penitent we hide in shame
And these spurious adulterations… our vile form of treason

So let the rain come down, let the lightning fly
Rest assured, we'll never have the answers
Erosion therapy, all that's left of you and me
Falling down and hiding all the ways that we've gone wrong

Let's watch the people point and stare at us each day
You know we've brought this on ourselves
They'll see us crumble as we count the many ways
I left us spineless and scarlet red… scarlet red

Dishonor and disgrace
Shining bright for all to see
Betrayal in our faces
And every stop sign in between

// Human Being //

I can't change the fact
That there's enough nukes in this place
To kill the world one million times over
We all sit back and accept it

Just part of being alive
Just part of being a human being

Trip over the homeless on the way to the store
We don't even notice anymore
Just waiting for the Prez to fix it
But his hands are tied just the same

A part of being alive
A part of being a human being

// Full Circle //

X marks the spot on the map where the treasure was found
A glint of brilliance when we all started to dig underground
We got bad reception down there, like we were from or on Mars
But everything became so clear, once I got all four bars

And now I've come full circle
Crash landing 1980
Time travel to the creepy crawl
The big crux of intensity
Keep me alive

Once I saw it with my own eyes, everything started shifting gears
I listened to the true sounds of adolescence and had no fear
Just an alley cat, looking for some skank in the danger zone
And if I had one more minute, man, this is the last thing I wanna hear

And now I've come full circle
Crash landing 1980
Time travel to the creepy crawl
The big crux of intensity
Keep me alive

Notes and chords mean everything to me
Infected for life, I've got the disease
Like germs spreading throughout the land
If you were there, you understand
Keep me alive
Keep me alive

X marks the spot on the map where the treasure was found

// Comeback Kid //

I thought…
If I could just shout it in your face
I could make it happen
You live you win, boy, and can't you see
You're the most valuable player to me

Comeback Kid – it's exciting to watch you live
What's inside of your broken lid
We all want you to win
I really want you to win

Where did you go? But I didn't know 
You were facing elimination
So many people rooting for you
They'd do anything to see you through

Comeback Kid – it's exciting to watch you live
What's inside of your broken lid
We all want you to win

You cleared your head – turned back time just like Superman
At the top of your game again
Now I know you can win

So much to do and so much time
Fill in the gap you left behind
So many lights inside your mind
I could feel it when you 
Called me after to fill in the gap
And when you laughed I knew everything was fine

Comeback Kid – it's exciting to watch you live
What's inside of your broken lid
We all want you to win

Hey, Comeback Kid
Welcome back the Comeback Kid… make him laugh
The Comeback kid… we all want you to win
I really want you to win

You live, you win
You live, you win

// Beyond The Music //

Started out with nothing to say
In a carpet cave we learn how to play
Talk about our favorite songs
We didn't know that this would last forever
As it played along

We set our course for any way out
Prayin' that the van wouldn't break down
Found some places we belong
Load the gear, play our songs
Who'd have known this would last forever
As it moved along

Here we are today
Still look each other in the face
Not expecting a single thing beyond the music

Still finding ways to share what we feel
For kids with no friends, it doesn't seem real
And there's nothing in this world
Not a dollar, dream or girl
That can rival what we have between us
Beyond the music

Here we are today
Still look each other in the face
Not expecting a single thing beyond the music

Frustrato-rock or chainsaw pop
Or whatever it is we play
This is our family
And it will always be this way
Beyond the music

We found our family
Beyond the music

// Days Of Desperation //

Most of our lives we been tryin' just to be happy
Most of our lives we been tryin' just to be free
 
Yeah we got plenty left to fight for
But now we got no one to fight against
 
Because our days of desperation
Are over now
Because our days of desperation
Are over now
 
Hidin' from authority
Hidin' from you and me
Duckin' in the alleyway
Hide from the world we both can see
 
Yes our days of desperation
Are over now
Because our days of desperation
Are over now
 
The rest of our life is free
Not gonna cower away
The rest of our life is easy
It's got to be… got to be

// Thinkin' //

Behind the smoke and lies and misdirection   
Lives a filthy joke not fit for virgin ears
Open hearts are prone to vivisection
And broken faith is epidemic here
So lock and load your guns, it's murder season
And once again the tyrants have their way
Dirty, and impervious to reason
Each trigger finger grows itchier every day
And along the way
 
It's strip mall hell and burger stands from jail to private jail
Worship those who prosper, heaven help you if you fail
Sobriety brings no relief, and drinking does no good
I think I've just been thinking just a little more than I should
 
I'll take the mandatory Prozac 
For something I have, something I lack
The latest fabricated disease
Still the pills preserve my mental welfare
So I'll still be insane, but won't care
Narcozombie smiling while…
 
Divided still we stand, and will demand the right to choose
Designer slavery chains and cheap TV
While every decent thing is torn up screaming by the roots
To feed the beasts, and all that they believe
Â

// Grindstone //

You took the bait, bought the whole rotten ticket
I know you're feeling betrayed
Life showed you how and where you could stick it
Maybe your trust was mislaid
Grindstone grinding
It's really wearing you down
Shoveling dung in the daily world circus
As "Chumpy," the everyday no class clown
 
They stick you up to shake you down
They set you up to take you down
 
Too late for a new bad decision
The fix is already in
Just keep shooting, you'll hit what you're missing
But come up empty again
Anger rises
And it's an impotent rage
Sing chapter and verse of your obsolete anthem
While time and the grindstone wear you away
 
It beats you up, and wears you down
It sets you up to tear you down

// Business A.U. //

Drank the Kool-Aid but it don't taste good
I'm doin' the things you said I should
I know my job is to be in control
But everything seems so out of control

Business as usual
How did I get here?
Business as usual
It's boring me to tears

How can it be that I hate my life
Two beautiful kids and a wonderful wife
But every time I'm staring at that screen
Those spreadsheets and numbers make me wanna scream

Business as usual
How did I get here?
Business as usual
It's boring me to tears

"Working from home" – playing guitar
Procrastination won't get you far
Is this a sign I'm not… cut… out?
I'll never Excel at PPT
And Word? FAIL.  My Outlook is bleak
Maybe it's time to quit… right… now
Don't even save your work

Business A.U.

Drank the Kool-Aid but it don't taste good
I'm doin' the things you said I should
But really I'm not, I'm just writing this song
And waiting for the end, I know it won't be long

Business as usual
How did I get here?
Business as usual
It's boring me 

Business as usual
Guilty as charged
I had to go postal
You broke my fucking heart
Business… Useless
Business A.U.

// Unchanged //

Turn around and run
This pair of broken vows is waiting up 'till dawn
There's no way it could ever be
Then it happened to you and me
And there's no super hero trying' ta save us
We're just stuck here
 
But it's OK - I'll be alright
Though I may call your name in vain 
In the throes of the darkest night
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged 
 
Lift your wheels and fly
And hold safe our memories by never asking "why"
Start living along the way
And maybe laugh again someday
'Cause there's no tragedy great enough to nullify us
It meant something
 
And it's OK - I'll be alright
Though I may call your name in vain 
In the throes of the darkest night
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged 
 
No, we're not the people in those photographs
Those better times have come and gone
But as we let it fall, try to recall the way I loved you
 
It's OK - I'll be alright
Though a thousand things may shake me
I'll take it without a fight
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged
