Time for a new me

I hear they're having a sale

At thrifty

I'm trading myself in

And I don't care what I get for it

'Cause I finally burned out

Been kicking myself 

For way too long


Finally found out 

What it feels like to be living a lie

Wasting my time, paralyzed

Wishing I was in another world


I'm taking a new tack

Gotta turn my back to turn back

I don't wanna close doors

But I don't wanna feel this way anymore

So I'm finding my way out

By turning away from a brick wall


Finally found out 

What it feels like to be living a lie

Wasting my time, paralyzed

Wishing I was in another world


Somebody tell me what to do

I've wasted my last 15 years

Jumping through their hoops

Only to find nothing waiting for me

But academic oblivion 

My proud destiny


See I finally burned out 

Been kicking myself 

For way too long


Finally found out 

What it feels like to be living a lie

Wasting my time, paralyzed

Wishing I was in another world


Wishing I was in another world..

(Somebody tell me what to do)

Wishing I was in another world:


Time for a new me.
