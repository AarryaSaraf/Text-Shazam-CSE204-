What do I care what you think of me
What do you think you mean to me
You mean nothing, can't you see
And I don't want to smell your stinky beaver

No fat beaver
No fat beaver
Swear I'm gonna leave her
Can't stand her fat beaver

You look real nice to talk to
But I can't stand to look at you
Stop chasing me all over the place
And get your fucking f.b. out of my face

No fat beaver
No fat beaver
Swear I'm gonna leave her
Can't stand her fat beaver

You may be the only chance I've got
But I think I'd rather be shot

What do I care what you think of me
What do you think you mean to me
You mean nothing, can't you see
Get away from me, you fucking f.b.
