I get up every morning
And make her coffee like I've always done
She won't look in my eyes
What has our love become?

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
I gave her everything I got
And she don't care

She don't care...
No she don't!

Ten years before
I recognized the sacrifice she made to be with me
Said 'when you want to you can leave'

It's easy to make promises
While you're dumb in love
Watch them all evaporate 
Because she's had enough

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
I gave her everything I got...

She made up her mind
I lost my wife, my lover, my best friend
And I don't think I'll ever be right again

It's easy to make promises
While you're dumb in love
Watch them all evaporate 
Because she's had enough

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
And I'm lonelier than you know...
She don't care

She don't care
She don't care
