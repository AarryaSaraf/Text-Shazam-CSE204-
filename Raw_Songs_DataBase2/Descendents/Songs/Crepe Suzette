Give me a chance, I'd shoot you
Give me a chance, baby
You'd see what I could do to you
You look pretty nice, so good, even kind
But I'm sure that you would dump me
And then not even look behind

But that's the way you are
Impossible to change
I'd kill you right now
But you're a little out of range

Give me a chance, I'd shoot you
Give me a chance, baby
You'd see what I could do to you
You know what I could do
You saw what I could do to you

But that's the way you are
Impossible to change
I'd kill you right now
But you're a little out of range

Let's go
