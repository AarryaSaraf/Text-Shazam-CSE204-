Do you know what I think about you? 
Do you know what I feel is true? 
Do you know what I think about her? 
I know she thinks about me, I'm sure

I don't know why it's so, but it's true 
I don't know why it's so, but it's true 


So you know what I think about you 
Do you know what you want me to do? 
When you see me staring at you,
Do you know what I want you to do? 

I don't know why it's so, but it's true 
I don't know why it's so, but it's true 
I don't know why it's so, but it's true 
I don't know why it's so, but it's true 


I don't want to have sex with you 
I want to be your friend 
I want to be with you 
I want you to marry me 

So you know what I think about you 
Do you know that my speed is you?
I know I want you to be my wife 
It's you and me for the rest of your life 

Do you know what I think about you?
