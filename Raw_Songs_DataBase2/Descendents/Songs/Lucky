Walking home on St. Patty's Day
I found a lucky penny along the way
Put it in my pocket
The one with the hole in it
These days things don't seem to go my way

I know it's tough sometimes to be with me
When I'm predicting rain most every day
Lately I've been right, almost every time
These days things don't seem to go my way

What would I do, if I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you

So I keep telling myself something's going to change
Maybe I'll get lucky then I can smile again
Cause that's what I want to do
I want a smile for you
I'm waiting for some things to go my way

What would I do, If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
Fuck St. Patty's Day
I'm throwing my pennies away
But I'm holding on to a single lucky charm
That's what I want to do
I want a smile for you
I'm waiting for some things to go my way

What would I do, If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't found you what would I do?
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
If I hadn't-a wouldn't-a couldn't-a, what would I do
If I hadn't already got lucky once with you
