Clean sheets mean a lot to a guy who sleeps on the floor. 
I wanted your love and a shelf on your dresser drawer. 
You tucked me in, stopped my tossin' and turnin',
But I turned back the covers, and I saw those sheets are dirty.

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

The warmth of a bed to a guy who sleeps on the floor
Was enough to perpetuate all the lies I heard before,
And now I wanna hold you, gotta hold my pillow instead,
'Cause my pillow will never lie, or be with a stranger in my bed.

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Where's the love I was lookin' for? It's out the door. 
I'm afraid to see you anymore, so it's back on the floor,
'Cause those sheets are dirty. 

[Guitar solo]

Woke up this mornin', alone on the floor,
Thinkin' about those clean sheets and the way it was before. 
When I looked in the mirror, I saw your face and thought of the past, 
But now I know how dirty you are-took my fist and smashed the glass!

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Those sheets are dirty.
Those sheets are dirty. 
Those sheets are dirty.
