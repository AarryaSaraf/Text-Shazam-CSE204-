Shove all your problems under the rug
Then you wonder where the smell came from
Rotting out from the inside

This is your fucked up family
So many minds that nobody ever speaks
Rotting out from the inside
Rotting out

Nuclear family falling out
Winter forever in this house, they're
Rotting out from the inside

So put me out of my misery
If it ever happens to me, no
Rotting out from the inside
Rotting out

Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out

Beat my head till I can't speak
Not gonna let it happen to me, no

Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out
