Started out with nothing to say
In a carpet cave we learn how to play
Talk about our favorite songs
We didn't know that this would last forever
As it played along

We set our course for any way out
Prayin' that the van wouldn't break down
Found some places we belong
Load the gear, play our songs
Who'd have known this would last forever
As it moved along

Here we are today
Still look each other in the face
Not expecting a single thing beyond the music

Still finding ways to share what we feel
For kids with no friends, it doesn't seem real
And there's nothing in this world
Not a dollar, dream or girl
That can rival what we have between us
Beyond the music

Here we are today
Still look each other in the face
Not expecting a single thing beyond the music

Frustrato-rock or chainsaw pop
Or whatever it is we play
This is our family
And it will always be this way
Beyond the music

We found our family
Beyond the music
