I'm upset, she don't know why
She don't know why I'm so high
I'm depraved, too far gone to save
She is fast, I will never last

I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night

She is playing with my heart
She is playing with my heart
But that's the way it goes

I'm depressed, she don't know why
Wanting more than a ticket can buy
I'll go in, and face reality
Watch her burn, but the fire is in me

I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night
I'll never make it through the night

She is playing with my heart
She is playing with my heart

But that's the way it goes
The way it is
The way it goes
Don't you know
