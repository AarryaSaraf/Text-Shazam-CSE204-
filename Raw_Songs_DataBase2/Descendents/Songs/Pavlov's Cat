Ring the bell but I'm not gonna listen
I'm no rat, don't want your cheese
I won't behave or be conditioned
Screw that, I'm Pavlov's cat

Every tired temptation put in front of me
Is just a new distraction to ignore
I don't want what you want me to
Won't run the maze no more

Ring the bell but I'm not gonna listen
I'm no rat, don't want your cheese
I won't behave or be conditioned
Screw that, I'm Pavlov's cat

You have a vested interest in obedience
You take pleasure in the power and control
It's easy to undo you
The magic word is "no"

Ring your bell (You get no compliance)
Can you tell (Existence is defiance)
Might as well (Condemn me to science)
Probe, shave, sterilize, euthanize me...

Ring the bell but I'm not gonna listen
I'm no rat, don't want your cheese
I won't behave or be conditioned
Screw that, I'm Pavlov's cat
Pavlov's cat
