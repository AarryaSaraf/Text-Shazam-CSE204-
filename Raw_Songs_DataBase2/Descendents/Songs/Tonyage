You beat up Fearl's bass player
You were all surfers last year
3 years ago it wasn't cool
You spit on me, but I'm no one
Eh, bobby pin had long hair
But you spit on Darby Crash
He had a fucking mohawk man
3 years ago
Forming in 1975
I'm a new waver
My girlfriend's a surfer
I'm no more a trendy than you are
And she's not going to fuck you anyways
Eh, it dosen't matter, you all suck
You don't know shit about punk rock
You're just a bunch of drug addicts
Screwing up what we call fun
I hate everything, that means you
I hate you more than I do
I got no time to sleep, time to get laid
I got a 2"x 2", but it dosen't matter
Fake hard core
You spit on urinals
