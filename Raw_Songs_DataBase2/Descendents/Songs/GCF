All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun

You can freak out, you can shoot up
You can fall down, you can self-destruct
Just leave me alone

Work hard, play hard
Work up a sweat stay out of trouble
If you're able don't spoil my day

So don't misunderstand what I say
It's hard to say no and not o.k.
Just take the drugs out of sex and drugs
And rock and roll

All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun

You can freebase, fall on your face
Waste what you got don't corrupt my life
Just leave me alone

Drown it in alcohol, I don't care at all
I like lust and sexual thrust
I like good clean fun

So don't misunderstand what I say
It's hard to say no and not o.k.
Take the drugs out of sex and drugs
And rock and roll

All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun
A good clean fun
