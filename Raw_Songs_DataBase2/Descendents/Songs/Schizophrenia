It's dark outside, I'm riding alone
But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road
A little scared, but I know where to go
Cuz I know the road
I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road

Hold on
Hold on
A fork in the road
Life in transition
Hold on
Hold on
Moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on
Hold on
Gotta feel the road
Know my position

Break the speakers
Crack the books
Over you shoulder
Not another look
Burn off the shackles
Of a wooden past
Melt through the ice
Be free at last
Dare to be stupid
Dare to smell
You can be crazy
You can be hell
The end result
Is always the same
Whichever you choose
You lose
You're insane

Granite poured into my veins
Black hole explodes in my brain
The accident is to blame

You say you're going insane
Say it like you mean it, man
I wish I could, but I can't

You say that life is a pain
It isn't for me, man
I don't feel anything at all

Shield myself from the world
Hold everything inside
Fold my arms across my chest

Shield the world from myself
Make sure the sleeves are tied
Wrap my arms across my chest

Death is my life
Life is my Death
Lay my arms across my chest

I know the road
I know where it goes
I know the road
I know where it goes
Don't tell me what I already know
I know where it goes
That's why I'm going so slow
