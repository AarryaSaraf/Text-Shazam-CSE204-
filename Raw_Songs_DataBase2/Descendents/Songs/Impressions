That could be me
That could be me
Walking along the Seine
Where I'd throw my glasses away

That could be us
That could be us
Walking through the garden

Watch the flowers melt together
Boats reflected in the river
The picture on my wall
Your picture in my wallet
Blurry and beyond
If I stare and stare
Maybe I'll be there

And we'd walk through
Breathe through
Open mouth

I don't care

And we'd walk through
Breathe through
Open mouth

What they'd say
