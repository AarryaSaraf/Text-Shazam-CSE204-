Hey hey, what do you say?
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what do you know?
Are you ready to go?

Go, go, go-go
If you think that everything's okay
Then go on home and lock your brain away

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready!

Hey hey, what do you say?
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what are we for?
Are you ready for war?

Fight, fight, fight-fight
Now's the time to defend your worthless life
Are you going to kill, or be killed?

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready to die?
