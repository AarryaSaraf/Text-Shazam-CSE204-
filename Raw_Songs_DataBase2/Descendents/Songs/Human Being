I can't change the fact
That there's enough nukes in this place
To kill the world one million times over
We all sit back and accept it

Just part of being alive
Just part of being a human being

Trip over the homeless on the way to the store
We don't even notice anymore
Just waiting for the Prez to fix it
But his hands are tied just the same

A part of being alive
A part of being a human being
