Go shoot your M-16. 
Go shoot your M-16.
Go shoot your M-16. 
I'm not gonna live your American dream.

Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.

Shoot him; you're better than him.
Shoot him in the eye.
Shoot him; it gives you a thrill.
Just like as a kid, only now it's for real.

Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.
