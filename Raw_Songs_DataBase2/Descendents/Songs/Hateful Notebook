The words she writes will change the world
She's much smarter than me
Inside she writes a side of herself
She won't let me see

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
It's all there in her little book
And I can't help but wonder
But she says I'll never understand

She says there's no love and everyone's out to get her
She keeps me shut out and I don't want to let her

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
It's all there in her little book
And I can't help but wonder
What chapter I fit under, yeah

I'm a stone age male and that's a fact
There's so much more to me than that

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
She's writing in her little book
She don't like me but she's got me hooked
And I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers
I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers
I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers, yeah
