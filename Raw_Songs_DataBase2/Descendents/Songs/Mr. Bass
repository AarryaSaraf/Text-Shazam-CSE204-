Mr. Bass lies waiting in his kelpy room
Waiting, til comes doom
He comes and then he goes
He sees Orca and then he knows

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

We finished the island with a broken motor
We went knocking on the bass' door
They were biting at alarming rate
Mr. Bass, he was irate

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes

He lies behind in a greenish hue
He'll eat whatever, he'll even eat you
Mr. Bass, he knows my hook
'Cause I've been reading them bassin' books

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes
