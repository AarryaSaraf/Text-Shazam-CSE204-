I see the anger in the back of your eyes
I know the vengeance running through your mind
You're up on the cross with a heart full of nails
Hanging your head low whenever you fail

You're thinking (now's the time)
You keep saying (now's the time)
But you still keep standing still
You're free now (now's the time)
It's over now (now's the time)
And I believe now's the time to live

And there ain't a thing now that you can do
You expect everyone to have pity on you
Nobody else can put their life in your hands
So get up and move while you still have the chance

With all of your mind
And all of your soul
And all of your heart
If you want to be smart
You've got a lot to give
Don't throw it away
You'll have your way some day
It will come to you

You're thinking (now's the time)
You keep saying (now's the time)
But you still keep standing still
You're free now (now's the time)
It's over now (now's the time)
And I believe now's the time to live

Do what you do with the rest of your days
You had it all and you gave some away
It's not going to matter when you're dead and gone
You'll be rewarded for the good that you've done

So quit thinking (now's the time)
And start doing (now's the time)
You've got a lot to live for
So quit crying (now's the time)
And start trying (now's the time)
Now's the time
Now's the time to live

You say you've been run through the lover's mill
But people are starving while you get your fill
There's no time for standing still
There's another void that you can fulfill
That you can fulfill

With all of your mind
And all of your soul
And all of your heart
If you want to be smart
You've got a lot to give
Don't throw it away
You'll have your way some day
It will come to you

So quit thinking (now's the time)
And start doing (now's the time)
You've got a lot to live for
So quit crying (now's the time)
And start trying (now's the time)
Now's the time
Now's the time to live
