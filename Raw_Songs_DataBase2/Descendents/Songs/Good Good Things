I know a place,
Up in the air
It's not very far,
I've been there before

Well I know a place,
Cool and warm
Cooling my blood,
Warming my heart

So come on down and walk with me,
And tell me I'm your man
I only want to know a couple of things about you

Where were you when I was in so much trouble with myself
And do you still believe in me like I believe

I've been thinking good good things about you
Cool and warm, good good things about you
If you've been thinking good good things about me
So cool and warm when you put your arms around me

On my own,
I know where to go
Living the lie,
In your eyes

Well I know a place,
Cool and warm
Cooling my blood,
And warming my heart

So come on down and walk with me,
And tell me I'm your man
Let's see if I can get it right with you this time around

I'm not afraid of losing you, my little girl
But do you still believe in me like I believe

I've been thinking good good things about you
Cool and warm, good good things about you
If you've been thinking good good things about me
So cool and warm when you put your arms around me
