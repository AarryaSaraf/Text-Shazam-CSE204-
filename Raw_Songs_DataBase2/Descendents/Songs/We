I don't care what they say
Those numbers don't mean a thing
We've got it made

This world is just me and you
And we know just what to do
We've got it made

Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made together)
Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made)

I don't care if we get a job
We've already got a life
We've got it made

I don't know what the future holds
All I know is you're there with me
That's all I need

Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made together)
Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made)

When I look in your eyes
I know what I want in life

Nothing more, nothing less
Nothing more, nothing less
(Everything's gonna be okay)

Nothing more, nothing less
(Everything's gonna be okay)
Be the key to my success
Nothing more, nothing less
