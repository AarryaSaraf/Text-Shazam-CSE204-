o worshippers of the mighty all

i had a dream

the bass master general came to me

we had a little snack at the donut shop


he said

"drink of my bonus cup, it is my blood"

"eat of this crapper, it is my body"

and his spirit entered me and i became all-ular

the bass master said "you are the chosen one"


"these are the all-o-gistics" 



thou shalt not commit laundry

thou shalt covet thy neighbor's food (all)

thou shalt not create ties with the scathed (no all)

thou shalt always go for greatness

thou shalt not commit adulthood (all)

thou shalt not partake of decaf (all!)

thou shalt not suppress flatulence 

thou shalt not commit hygiene (all!)

thou shalt not have no idea (all)

thou shalt commit thyself to an institution (no all)

thou shalt not take the van's name in vain

thou shalt not allow anything to deter you in your quest for all (all!)


tell me good people who is the sole achiever 

who has ground his teeth and gums 

so we may live in the beauty of all 

(bass master general)


you may achieve all 

and not wallow unknown for eternity, 

all you have to do is do it! all!

(we shall achieve all)


study them, believe in them, 

you must believe, do you believe in it?! 

believe and you shall achieve 

(we shall achieve all)


he who bears the most gas, 

let him also bear forth his ass, 

and cast forth the first frap 

(all!)


you may achieve bass by chanting the small psalm of all (all!)

chant with me

qwah qwaaaah qwaoh qwah 

chant!

qwah qwaaaah qwaoh qwah

pretty good, pretty good

qwah qwaaaah qwaoh qwah 
qwah qwaaaah qwaoh qwah 



oh no! here we go again! 

the mighty spirit has taken over! 

do you feel it, do you feel it?! 

(bass master general)


he does everything for us  

for when he brought it among us 

the bass master issued forth an all-timatum: 

(we shall achieve all)


if you believe, if you believe 

you shall achieve all, all, allll!!! 

(we shall achieve all!)
