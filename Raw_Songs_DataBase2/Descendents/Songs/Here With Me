Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey
You would call it a perfect day
And naturally I'd have to agree
If you were here with me

When I'm hanging out with all my friends
Something still holds back my smile
Something tells me they're the enemy, the enemy
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

And I know she was everything
When everybody's having fun
I sit and stare at everyone
Back to myself again

I took a walk outside along the beach
Watch the waves roll along the shore
The things I felt before aren't there anymore, not anymore
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

And everybody's having fun
But not me
I sit and stare at everyone

Back to myself again
Back to myself again

Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey

Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about
Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about her
