Why do I daydream?

Oh why do I get my hopes up at all?

I've been living this Walter Mitty life for too long

Somebody save me

I'm a prisoner of my own fears


Sometimes fantasy is the only problem I bear

My mind is a dream filled balloon

Dripping dreams into my shoes

And I'm too afraid to move

To face the real world

And when I fall, I fall down hard

When will I ever learn?

Don't take your dreams to heart 

You'll only wind up getting burned

(BURNED)


Well maybe I'm lazy

But circumstances always knock me down

So I'll just lie here

Never get up, off the ground

Well maybe it's crazy 

To sit and think of all the things I want to do

What's the use of dreaming

When dreams never come true?


And when I fall I fall down hard

When will I ever learn?

Don't take your dreams to heart

You'll only wind up getting burned


Why do I daydream? 

Why do I daydream? 

Why do I bother? 

WHY?


Why do I daydream? (Time to get up off your ass)

Why do I daydream? (Pull your head up take a chance)

Why do I bother? (Grab whatever you can grab)

WHY? (There's no such thing)


It's time to get up off your ass

Pull your head up take a chance

Grab whatever you can grab

There's no such thing


It's time to get up off your ass

Pull your head up take a chance

Grab whatever you can grab

There's no such thing


It's time to get up off your ass

Pull your head up take a chance

Grab whatever you can grab

There's no such thing

No such thing
