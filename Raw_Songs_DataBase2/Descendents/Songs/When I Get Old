What will it be like when I get old

Will I still hop on my bike, and ride around town
Will I still want to be someone, and not just sit around
I don't want to be like other adults 'cause they've already died
Cool and condescending, fossilized

Will I be rich, will I be poor
Or will I still sleep on the floor
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old

Will I still kiss my girlfriend and try to grab her ass
Will I still hate the cops and have no class
Will all my grown up friends say they've seen it all before
They say hey act your age and I'm immature

Will I do myself proud
Or only what's allowed
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old

Will I sit around and talk about the old days
Sit around and watch T.V.
I never want to go that way
Never burn out not fade away

As I travel through my time
Will I like what I find
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old
