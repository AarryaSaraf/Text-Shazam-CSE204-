Spent the last years

In denial of my grief

Because you hated me

Anyone could see

I'll always wonder

What I meant to you

And why you hated me

What I did to you


I can't get anywhere

Pretending that I don't care

Lying to everyone I see

When the only thing I needed was


One more day like yesterday

I'd pick you up, you'd put me down

Wish you were still around

For one more day like yesterday

With you


And in the end

We didn't have a thing to say

Still those games to play 

Then you passed away

I'll always wonder

Why you had to leave

Why you hated me

Then laid the blame on me


Cold antiseptic stares

The smell of the sickroom air

Yeah, I let you go down there

The only child

Who never cared about


One more day like yesterday

I'd pick you up, You'd put me down

Wish you were still around

For one more day like yesterday

With you


I'll always wonder

If I could have meant more to you

I'll always wonder 

If I could have done more for you

How could I just turn my back

How could I just walk away

How could I just close my eyes 

And watch you die


We never got along

We never got a chance

To sing our song of love


I loved my daddy boy

Did you love your boy?

Oh, you feel so warm to me now

But it's cold in this room

Tomorrow they'll put you

In the ground

Then there's nothing I can

ever do to have


One more day like yesterday

I'd pick you up, you'd put me down

Wish you were still around

For one more day like yesterday

With you
