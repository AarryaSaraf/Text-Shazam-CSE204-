In the world of man in the great rat race
Makes his speeches then he does what he please
Winners of the mosh impart their grace
As I wallow in the mush in a doggy daze

I live in a kennel smells like rotten cheese
Chums lots of flies but why should I mind
Then I get trashed by the ho that's my wife
She can't get enough of kickin' my hiney

Life in the canine world
Cats to chase and a bone to bury
Full of doggy stench in this poo poo place
If I get a piece of tail I don't want to get married

This is just a doghouse why should I stay
If these folks are crazy
They try to tell me that they know where it's at
I don't know maybe I'm lazy

This is just a doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

So now it's time to go work for the man
I work for the man at the taco stand
I keep on grinding like a dog always does
No place to hide for this American dog

This is my doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

When I frickin' find what I'm lookin' for
I dig right in and take my place
Maybe I seem crass and crude
But a dog's gotta do what a dog has to do

This is my doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

I'm just a dog, I eat cat feces
Feel like a hydrant on this doggy street
I live in the doghouse, everybody hates me
I want to get laid, but everybody takes me

I'm your dog and you're bitches
