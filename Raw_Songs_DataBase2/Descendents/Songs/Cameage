I'm looking straight down
I'm sick and I need a friend
I didn't know they came like that
I'm thinking things now
I thought I'd never think
I didn't know they came like that

You came so quickly
Right in and out of my life
I didn't know they came like that
Did I ever tell you
How much I love to hold you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one

I judged too quickly
I've never been good at trust
I didn't know they came like that
But did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one
No turning back from this one

It's not that I don't want your love
But I don't deserve anyone
I didn't know they came like that
I will return to you
When I am 32
I didn't know they came like that

You came so quickly
Right in and out of my life
I didn't know they came like that
Did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one
No turning back from this one

Did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that
