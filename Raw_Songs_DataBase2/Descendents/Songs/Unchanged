Turn around and run
This pair of broken vows is waiting up 'till dawn
There's no way it could ever be
Then it happened to you and me
And there's no super hero trying' ta save us
We're just stuck here
 
But it's OK - I'll be alright
Though I may call your name in vain 
In the throes of the darkest night
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged 
 
Lift your wheels and fly
And hold safe our memories by never asking "why"
Start living along the way
And maybe laugh again someday
'Cause there's no tragedy great enough to nullify us
It meant something
 
And it's OK - I'll be alright
Though I may call your name in vain 
In the throes of the darkest night
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged 
 
No, we're not the people in those photographs
Those better times have come and gone
But as we let it fall, try to recall the way I loved you
 
It's OK - I'll be alright
Though a thousand things may shake me
I'll take it without a fight
Life's not the same
But must we remain unchanged
