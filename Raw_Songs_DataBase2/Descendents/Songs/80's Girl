She says you're the only one
But she's an 80's girl
And she can't get enough
Treat you so right till your supply runs dry

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please

Vroom - in a brand new car
She drives to the beach
Knows the language well
The moves and the speech
Behind a blinding smile
Hides her empty eyes

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please suck my friends
Won't you please

80's girl needs a friend
Party down with everyone
80's girl needs a friend
Love you for the weekend
Won't you please love my friends

She's so modern
She's so stylish
Mohawk on one side
Long hair on the other
She's got all her bases covered

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please suck my friends

She always wants someone else
She's an 80's girl, looking out for herself
So where do you draw the line
Between a whore and a concubine?

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please

80's girl needs a friend
Getting the goods and having such a good time
80's girl needs a friend
Love you for the weekend
80's girl needs a friend
Never, never let it happen again

Won't you please love my friends
Won't you please fuck
