Money, it'll feed my tummy
But it, will never feed my soul
Where my soul should me
There's a hole in me
I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem

Funny, when you got no money
Then your, time is not your own
Where my time should be, there's only drudgery
I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem

Gotta have a reason to get out of my bed
I never want to feel my life's been wasted
Makin money, it'll feed my tummy
But it, will never feed my soul
When my soul should be
There's a hole in me

I can't live from 9 to 5
That's not enough to keep me alive

Gotta have a fantasy
Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem
Gotta have a fantasy

Gotta have a dream
Doesn't matter what it may be
Only what it may seem to me
