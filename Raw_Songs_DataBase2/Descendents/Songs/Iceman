He's not alive
He can't dream
Stone cold monster
Thinking machine
Never feels
Anger or pain
What's left of his heart
Is inside his brain

Get down on your knees
Say pretty please
Or do you want to freeze?

The iceman cometh

My pretty pretty thing
Do you you want to freeze?

Born without a hug
Or an ounce of love
Doesn't know how much
He can hurt someone
Do you feel the chill
In his calculated prose?
His words will kill
If you leave yourself exposed

He is part of our generation
Let us mourn
It's too late to save this child
It started when he was born

The iceman cometh

Keep your distance
Don't get too close
A beautiful girl once made that mistake

She froze

The iceman cometh

He is part of our generation
Let us mourn
