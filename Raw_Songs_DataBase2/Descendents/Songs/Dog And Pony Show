Another night of maybe and almost

Abandoning a land of passin' ghosts


Just a lot of sad people forgive them Lord

They don't care what they do

Or who they do it to

At the dog and pony show


They don't wanna know


To think I could have stayed home

Instead of watching this ugly lust and ordinary dirt

But no one cares, so nobody gets hurt


Just a lot of sad people forgive them Lord

They don't care who they do

Or what it does to you

At the dog and pony show

They don't wanna know

They're doing some blow


They all stand in line and take their chances

Roping all their robot dances

Dying to get off

There's a lot of pretty girls here looking tight

They're not good girls

But they're good for the night

They're telling me to buzz off

Well that's okay, cause I never liked them anyway


It's no place for a mongrel mutt like me

Mating rights go to the best of breed


Just a lot of sad people

Caught in between 

Desire and despair

I guess I'll see you there

At the lost and lonely

Dog and pony show


They don't wanna know

They don't wanna know

They don't wanna know

So afraid and alone
