Child of autumn was born
To a world of deceit and then a land of lies
Break her bonds would take her away
The stars that stands are lost in eternal sorrow

Ah...

She walks across the country
She holds her hand up high in the rain
Mother was screaming for help
She turns around to stare at a scene from her memory

Ah...

She sighing, wishing her heart
Flew through a flap of wings that's come from a dream
That someone is waiting to see her name
Coming to inside at the cusp of eternity

Ah...
