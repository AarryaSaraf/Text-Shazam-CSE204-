As we witness the hunt begin
In the aura of blood, the hounds move in
As you follow a failing heart
And crack the norms apart
Remain perfectly still

Arch your spine, cat your shame
Accusation to your name
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth

Dragging bygones into the sun
Attempt to flee persecuted by speeding time
You are giving yourself away
Behind the mask but straight against the heart of events

Arch your spine, cat your shame
Accusation to your name
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth

Self woe
It is glaring
You have made up your mind
As you deem fit
The devil's wit
Makes you ask for it
And God submits

The pendant shackled around your neck
The decision is made behind darkened glass
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features of the drawing mirrors you
But your defense present a new detail
Shedding light upon a brother's trail

A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
But your defense present a new detail
Shedding light upon a brother's trail
