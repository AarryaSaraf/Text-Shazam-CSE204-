"För det... om man man slutar tänka... då blir man död"

// Dignity //

"Vid ett årsskifte så upplever många en känsla av vemod vid tanke på det som aldrig mer återkommer. För andra är det ett ögonblick av förväntan inför möjligheten att erövra det nya. Andra åter känner oro inför en förändring som innebär ovisshet och kanske försämring. Alla dessa stämningar är var för sig förklarliga. Någon sa här om dagen att vi lever i det stora uppbrottets tid..."

Prince of lies is on his knees
Holy rites, spreading the disease
By his side a youthful girl
Wedlocked force unfurls
She's young
Far too young

Far too young

Can we dictate a life with dignity?
Foul agenda corrupt in secrecy
Oh no no no no no

One false prayer wielding blasphemy
Price the spirit as a wanted property
Oh no no no no no

Congratulations to the five men of affairs
There was a purpose with this life
Insinuations (that) if she holds anything dear
Then it motivates submission in his lair

Roar

He is waiting for darkness
He opens the door
He's slithering

// Heart In Hand //

"Det är för bedrövligt! Usch!"
"Vem fan är du?"

Take it as a threat now and leave
Drop of toxins flows to a habit
Tell me what it is you can't see
Teeth grinding flesh in the sabbath

Factual drowning stream, you believe
Slaves will follow conspiracy
Turn the locks on brother and kin
Murder lust on affinity

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real, and we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

Intolerance disguised as a faith
In secrecy we shun empathy
Soul critique online far too late
A throne for the devout enemy

War in utopia
Slay cornucopia for symmetry

The parody is real, and we're biding time
And while losing ground, make sure to worship monarchy
Death is but a story in a land of borrowed wealth
The burdened scale weighs heavy with the hunt for dopamine

When I was young
So, so much younger than today
It seemed easier to lead your life
There was no time to surrender
And no reason to perceive
The burden of pain
As it passed through our lives every year somehow
And it never really went away
Yet behind my door
Was a kingdom
A secret outline showed the way
To treasures of clay
And beads made of glass

"Usch!"

// Next Of Kin //

Every morrow, every year
Choir in the sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

Someone dies within creation
Doubts in everlasting life
How to lie to one innocent child
You are loved, I'm execrated
You belong, I circle strife
Routine pathways in escape from the wild

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

Every morrow, every year
Choir in the sounds
The final sorrow, so shed a tear

We are left in a city all alone
In the breathing of ashes
On the earth, one second
Just a piece of meat in essence

We are left in a world that's burning
Crawling through embers to safety
And my name is next to last
Feast on famine and death on the broadcast

Finding friends in algorithms
Forgot the sound of my daughter's voice
Please remind me of my emptiness
The hissing of machines lost rhythm
As death would give an interview
In a metropolitan holiness

I am outside waiting
Outside waiting
I am outside waiting
Outside waiting

Am I the last one of my kind,
Who's afraid of dying?
But I would perish to save a child
And give all I can for love
It seems I might have reconciled
Even if my destiny's lying
For the ones I hold dear I hold close
And force my way through the ether

// Lovelorn Crime //

A voice through vapor
20 yards ahead
Is calling for your name
The empty paper
Waiting on the bed
It sets the waiting game

Credits to a dream

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you

Ghost of memories, heavy on my brow
But changing over time
New ambitions corrupting every vow
Unfolding lovelorn crime

Credits to a dream

You can always strike me down
You can always say I'm wrong
You can always strike me down
But I will always wait for you
Yes, I will always wait for you

// Charlatan //

"Vem är Gud? (Vad är Gud?)"
"Det är en svår fråga!"
"Jag tror inte på Gud? (Tror du på Gud?)"
"Nej!"
"Varför skulle jag?"

Three thousand dreams in pale moonlight
Counting...
Three thousand years of Winter's blight
Ticking off against my heart

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Three hundred days in an endless night
The frost smiles
Three hundred weapons on manhunt
Craving more blood to its name

Here come the months of squalor
Clasp death in his parlor
A sorrow celebration
She canes a thousand creations

Cities, violated graves
Yonder distance, perfect slave
You!

"Gud, Gud, Gud... är Gud hans namn?"
"Nä, Jesus!"
"Finns det bara en Gud?"
"Nä"
"Hur många finns det?"
"30 miljoner hundratusentals"
"Oj!"
"Det är en I varje land"
"Ok"
"Kan de prata med varandra?"
"Nä"

"Han kan flyga bara har ([?]) ett huvud, på en månbild!"
"Folk säger att han vakar över oss där uppe"
"En dör"
"Det finns inget rätt eller fel" [x4]
"Vad tror du händer när man dör?"
"Jag tror väl mest att man... ligger kvar på sin gravplats, typ"

// Universal Truth //

Sweat on the brow runs over faces made of snow
There comes a time in life when death may come too slow

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You have waited far too long
But Spring is set in bloom
You have conquered love inside
Yet sorrow is your doom

The debts are long since paid, inheritance is set
Still agitation reels inside, lest you forget
Lest you forget

At sunrise Friday morning
A haven for your sins
The written dedication
Etched into your skin

Time won't heal the wounds you bare
Between old pride and desperate prayers

Time won't heal any wounds you bare
A set few years of your life are stolen
Light cast on the obvious
Behold the white when it's faded golden

A stranger's truth holds no water here
But soon we may have learned
Dead sympathy, a aversion proceeds

A voice lives in your chest
That comforts wary thoughts
Yet the brook is still too wide
To bridge the gap you've sought

Honesty in the necrology
The offspring smear your name in print

You trade your vices every day religiously
A pack of vultures wait for everyone to see

You gave away too much, a harness on your kin
For any transgressions never mirrored mortal sin
Mortal sin

You're still alone

The day in zenith now
You made it through the night
Voice of perdition
Came and went far out of sight

// The Garroter //

Lone hunter in the fray
Of a lonely fading light
A manifest for the garroter
Stuck to his plight

Young and elder, nevermind
Programmed mortal set lifeline

A mother says no
And father cracks a simple plan
A knife is sharpened
His children run but he'll advance

Alas, how fragile life can be
Love is strong when death foresees
Yet the story won't end here
No, oh no, oh no

Ulterior motive
The grinning face of leadership
A selfish wish to control
A nation in his grip

Strong against weak and immobilized
Secular for fascist lies

The beautiful people
Look down from ruby vantage points
While in the gutter
Starvation invites us to join

Barricades of wealthy youth
Protesting their inborn truth

// Continuum //

Empty house, and empty pockets
There's an echo in the hall
I keep your picture in a locket
In the past, we had it all
But the Summer fades away
Rainy day tomorrow

In the company of dawning
In the presence of a friend
I was subject to a wanting
And unable to ascend
So I opened up my gate
It's too late to wonder

"Det är bara en ny dag, inget särskilt har hänt"

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

You are moving away from home
Escaping the monochrome
One after another
Striding along the road
Past the crest, you will be free
Laid to rest now, let it be
Honest promise to a degree
The edge too sharp for guarantees

Once there was a moment
Time was on my side
Rust and silk bestowment
Balanced on my pride

A part of our past is still there
Underneath your shoes
The memory's stuck in your chest
The idle truth is up to you
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

Life is so fragile, I know
And even if I heard
A yearning voice in your heart
Old routines always kept us apart
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless
The river of time flows on
Blind and ruthless

// All Things Will Pass //

Rose of Summer, withered times
Shadows fall on contouring lines
Far beyond a sleeping wish
Lunar tongue on a lasting bliss

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Lend yourself...

Clouds of dust in a waning light
You have given up on plight
Time is now, my dearest friend
Hidden years and a heart to mend

And should we meet again
The loss of everything
Three wishes to a friend
Three hundred sorrows gather
But if we lend ourselves
Amidst rock and poison grime
There may well be a time
A kingdom past its prime

Dead within a dream
Icy river stream

Your silver voice in my throat
Potion without an antidote
A routine death for the well-immersed
After all, the years have left us cursed
A simple test in an iron cage
Old tradition in a modern age
Strong and true are the weak at heart
I am you, you am I

If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?
If everything ends
Is it worth to turn back home again?

// The Mob //

Autumn creeps away now, vanquishing mob rules
Torches in their eyes, prowling to unravel hidden jewels
Drown me in the lake where stones divide the mist
Inheritance of others courting the dismissed

Take me too away from here
Far away
Please don't leave me be

The forests waning beauty 'neath a drafted epitaph
It's our human duty as plastic in the rough
To tether on the heartstrings of a mythic century
Paving for destruction
Waving mock decrees

Watch yourself every day
You are dying
But please don't leave me be

Do it for yourself
Tomorrow is the past
Do it for yourself
Not even actual facts can last

Please don't leave me be

Is it true that the mirror shows the enemy?

// Width Of A Circle //

As we witness the hunt begin
In the aura of blood, the hounds move in
As you follow a failing heart
And crack the norms apart
Remain perfectly still

Arch your spine, cat your shame
Accusation to your name
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth

Dragging bygones into the sun
Attempt to flee persecuted by speeding time
You are giving yourself away
Behind the mask but straight against the heart of events

Arch your spine, cat your shame
Accusation to your name
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth

Self woe
It is glaring
You have made up your mind
As you deem fit
The devil's wit
Makes you ask for it
And God submits

The pendant shackled around your neck
The decision is made behind darkened glass
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features of the drawing mirrors you
But your defense present a new detail
Shedding light upon a brother's trail

A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
And deconstructing everything you've said
Jaws of speculation, lust for truth
A trail to investigate, deceptive eyes
The features in the drawing mirrors you
But your defense present a new detail
Shedding light upon a brother's trail

// Freedom & Tyranny //

Let us refuse to wait 'til morning
Return the ghost from whence it came
A version of the forgery slipped through
Tampered with the facts and changed its name

Yet every night has its consoling agents
Close your eyes and see

The emperor will ride without direction
And give us submission as a price
Salvation is hidden in the fire
Fall to your knees, devour the lies

Yet every night has its consoling agents
Close your eyes and see

Sovereign smoke is overcast
Free will wasn't meant to last

Hidden in a dream
Suffrage reigns
The changing, unshackled yearning
Once again, same refrain
Echo through the kingdom
Songs of love and death
Wounds of love and death
