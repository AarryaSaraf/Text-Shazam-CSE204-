// Mellotron Heart //

I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promise to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghosts of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now, don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

// The Throat Of Winter //

The throat of Winter is upon us
And the cold will linger in me

A shield on the eternal river again

Our fevered bodies will return
to the bowels of the vast decrepit earth

The devil spoke and called you to his side

Never will return again
Never will I see the rain
Never will return again
Never will I feel the rain

The throat of Winter

A demigod is observing us through child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
A demigod is observing us through child-like eyes
And his hordes are returning now
