Album: 21stCenturyBreakdown

// Song Of The Century //

Sing us a song of the century
That's louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Leading us into the promised land

Tell us a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
They're playing a song of the century
Panic and promise and prosperity

Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

// 21st Century Breakdown //

[Part I]

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born, and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost, but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games through the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost, but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

[Part II]

We are the class of, the class of '13
Born in the era of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised through the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride (Hey!)
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands and a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet (Hey!)
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The freedom to obey
It's the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line

[Part III]

Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons

// Know Your Enemy //

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, rah-eh!
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
And silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes, say!

Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!

Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, silence is the enemy, so gimme, gimme revolution!

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

(Do you know the enemy?)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
(Do you know the enemy?)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
So rally up the demons of your soul! (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)

// ¡Viva La Gloria! //

Hey, Gloria, are you standing close to the edge?
Look out to the setting sun, the brink of your vision
Eternal youth is a landscape of a lie
The cracks of my skin can prove, as the years will testify
Say your prayers and light a fire, we're gonna start a war
Your slogan's a gun for hire, it's what we waited for
Hey, Gloria, this is why we're on the edge
The fight of our life's been drawn to this undying love

Gloria! ¡Viva la Gloria!
You blast your name in graffiti on the walls
Falling in broken glass that's slashing through your spirit
I can hear it like a jilted crowd!
Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
You found a home in all your scars and ammunition
You made your bed in salad days amongst the ruins
Ashes to ashes of our youth!

She smashed her knuckles into winter (Gloria!)
As autumn's wind fades into black
She is the saint of all the sinners (Gloria!)
The one that's fallen through the cracks
So don't put away your burning light!

Gloria! Where are you, Gloria?
Don't lose your faith to your lost naiveté
Weather the storm, and don't look back on last November
When your banners were burning down!
Gloria! ¡Viva la Gloria!
Send me your amnesty down to the broken hearted
Bring us the season that we always will remember
Don't let the bonfires go out!

So, Gloria, send out your message of
The light that shadows in the night
Gloria, where's your undying love?
Tell me the story of your life, your life!

// Before The Lobotomy //

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singing, I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dying, everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Signed, "My love," a lost memory
From the end of the century

Well, it's enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
But when the sky is falling down
You burned your dreams into the ground

Christian's lesson's what he's been sold (Hey!)
We are normal and self-controlled (Hey!)
Remember to learn to forget (Hey!)
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes

Well, I'm not stoned, I'm just fucked up
I got so high I can't stand up
Well, I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed
I'm not in love, 'cause I'm a mess

Like refugees (Ooh)
We're lost like refugees (Ooh)
Like refugees (Ooh)
We're lost like refugees (Ooh)
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singing, I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dying, everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground

// Christian's Inferno //

I got under the grip between this modern hell
I got the rejection letter in the mail and it was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chased in blood
There's fire in my veins and it's pouring out like a flood

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby, baby, maybe you're the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb, I am your chosen one
Toxin your reservoir and then return man to ape

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno
Whoa-oh, Christian's inferno

// Last Night On Earth //

I text a postcard sent to you
Did it go through?
Sending all my love to you
You are the moonlight of my life
Every night
Giving all my love to you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you

With every breath that I am worth
Here on Earth
I'm sending all my love to you
So if you dare to second-guess
You can rest
Assured that all my love's for you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
I'm sending all my love to you

My beating heart belongs to you
I walked for miles 'til I found you
I'm here to honor you
If I lose everything in the fire
Did I ever make it through?

// East Jesus Nowhere //

"Reberu rajio!"
"¡La última noche!"
"And we will see how Godless a nation we have become."
(...em sseug dnoceS) ...em tset t'noD

Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well
(Stand up!) All the white boys
(Sit down!) And the black girls
(Stand up!) You're the soldiers
(Sit down!) Of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in "the river of a shadow of doubt"
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
The missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion!

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

Yeah!

// Peacemaker //

One, two, three, four!

Well, I've got a fever, a non-believer, I'm in a state of grace
For I am the Caesar, I'm gonna seize the day (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call of the banshee, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
As God as my witness, the infidels are gonna pay
Well, call the assassin, the orgasm, a spasm of love and hate
For what will divide us? The righteous and the meek (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call of the wild, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the girl at the end of the serenade

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Well, shots ringing out on the holy parasite

Well, I am a killjoy from Detroit, I drink from a well of rage
I feed off the weakness with all my love (Ah, ah-ah)
Well, call up the captain, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the lover that you were dreaming of
Well, this is a stand-off, a Molotov cocktail's on the house
You thought I was a write-off, you better think again (Ay, ay-ay)
Well, call the peacemaker, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began

Vendetta, sweet vendetta
This Beretta of the night
This fire and the desire
Well, shots ringing out on the holy parasite

Well, now the caretaker's the undertaker
So I'm gonna go out and get a peacemaker
This is a Neo Saint Valentine's massacre (Ah, ah-ah)
Well, call up the Gaza, hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

// Last Of The American Girls //

She puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She is paranoid, endangered species headed into extinction
She is one of a kind, well she's the last of the American girls

She wears her overcoat for the coming of the nuclear winter
She is riding her bike like the fugitive of Critical Mass
She's on a hunger strike for the ones who won't make it for dinner
She makes enough to survive for a holiday of working class

She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated
She won't cooperate, well she's the last of the American girls

She plays her vinyl records, singing songs on the eve of destruction
She's a sucker for all the criminals breaking the laws
She will come in first for the end of western civilization
She's an endless war, she's a hero for the lost cause

Like a hurricane in the heart of the devastation
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls

She puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
She's got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
She will come in first for the end of western civilization
She's a natural disaster, she's the last of the American girls

Aw, yeah
Alright
Aw, yeah

// Murder City //

Desperate but not hopeless
I feel so useless in the murder city
Desperate but not helpless
The clock strikes midnight in the murder city

I'm wide awake after the riots
This demonstration of our anguish
This empty laughter has no reason
Like a bottle of your favourite poison
We are the last call and we're so pathetic

Desperate but not hopeless
I feel so useless in the murder city
Desperate but not helpless
The clock strikes midnight in the murder city

Christian's crying in the bathroom
And I just want to bum a cigarette
We've come so far, we've been so wasted
It's written all over our faces
We are the last call and we're so pathetic

Desperate but not hopeless
I feel so useless in the murder city
Desperate but not helpless
The clock strikes midnight in the murder city

Desperate but not hopeless
I feel so useless in the murder city
Desperate but not helpless
The clock strikes midnight in the...

// ¿Viva La Gloria? (Little Girl) //

Little girl, little girl, why are you cryin'?
Inside your restless soul, your heart is dyin'
Little one, little one, your soul is purgin'
Of love and razor blades, your blood is surgin'

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

Little girl, little girl, your life is callin'
The charlatans and saints of your abandon
Little one, little one, the sky is fallin'
Your lifeboat of deception is now sailin'
In the wake (All the way!) All the way, no rhyme or reason
Your bloodshot eyes will show your heart of treason
Little girl, little girl, you dirty liar
You're just a junkie preaching to the choir

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray for the Salvation Army
There is no place like home when you got no place to go

The traces of blood always follow you home
Like the mascara tears from your getaway (Gloria!)
You're walking with blisters and running with shears
So unholy, sister of grace

Run away from the river to the street
And find yourself with your face in the gutter
You're a stray from the Salvation Army
There is no place like home

// Restless Heart Syndrome //

I've got a really bad disease
It's got me begging on my hands and knees
So, take me to emergency
'Cause something seems to be missing
Somebody, take the pain away
It's like an ulcer bleeding in my brain
So send me to the pharmacy so I can lose my memory

I'm elated, medicated
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away

I think they found another cure
For broken hearts and feeling insecure
You'd be surprised what I endure
What makes you feel so self-assured?

I need to find a place to hide
You never know what could be waiting outside
The accidents that you could find
It's like some kind of suicide

So what ails you, is what impales you
I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied

I'm a victim of my symptom
I am my own worst enemy
You're a victim of your symptom
You are your own worst enemy
Know your enemy

I'm elated, medicated
I am my own worst enemy
So what ails you is what impales you
You are your own worst enemy
You're a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy
You're a victim of the system
You are your own worst enemy

// Horseshoes And Handgrenades //

One, two, three, four!

I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters
I think we've got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around?
Want you to knock me out?
Well, you missed me, kissed me
Now you better kick me down

Maybe you're the runner-up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and handgrenades

I'm gonna burn it all down
I'm gonna rip it out
Well, everything you employ
Was meant for me to destroy
To the ground now
So don't you fuck me around
Because I'll shoot you down
I'm gonna drink, fight and fuck
And I'm pushing my luck
All the time now

Maybe you're the runner-up
But the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in
Horseshoes and handgrenades

Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this age-old contradiction

Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this age-old contradiction
Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this old age

I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
Well, I'm a hater, a traitor
In a pair of Chuck Taylors right now
I'm not fucking around

G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!

// The Static Age //

Can you hear the sound of the static noise blasting out in stereo?
Cater to the class and the paranoid music to my nervous system
Advertising love and religion, murder on the airwaves
Slogans on the brink of corruption

Visions of blasphemy, war and peace
Oh, screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Billboard on the rise in the dawn's landscape, working your insanity
Tragic á la madness and concrete Coca-Cola execution
Conscience on a cross and your heart's in a vice
Squeezing out your state of mind
Are what you own that you cannot buy

What a fucking tragedy, strategy
Oh, screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

Hey, hey, it's the static age
Well, this is how the west was won
Hey, hey, it's the static age millennium

All I want to know is a god damned thing
Not what's in the medicine
All I want to do is I want to breathe
Batteries are not included

What's the latest way that a man can die?
Screaming "Hallelujah" (Hallelujah)
Singing out "the dawn's early light"
The silence of the rotten, forgotten
Oh, screaming at you

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

I can't see a thing in the video
I can't hear a sound on the radio
In stereo in the static age

The static age

// 21 Guns //

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide
Did someone break your heart inside
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

Did you try to live on your own
When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone?

When it's time to live and let die
And you can't get another try
Something inside this heart has died
You're in ruins

One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
One, 21 Guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, 21 Guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

You and I

// American Eulogy //

[Part 1: American Eulogy]

Sing us the song of the century
It sings like American eulogy
The dawn of my love and conspiracy
Of forgotten hope and the class of '13
Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me

[Part 2: Mass Hysteria]

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

Red alert is the color of panic
Elevated to the point of static
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun
Idle thought leads to full-throttle screaming
And the wealth is asphyxiating
Mass confusion is all the new rage
And it's creating a feeding ground for the bottom feeders of

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

True sounds of maniacal laughter
And the deaf mute's misleading the choir
The punchline is a natural disaster
And it's sung by the unemployed
Fight fire with a riot
The class war is hanging on a wire
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar
When he said, "It's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the..."

Hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria
Mass hysteria

There's a disturbance on the oceanside
They tapped into the reserve
The static response is so unclear now
"Mayday, this is not a test"
As the neighborhood burns
America is falling
Vigilantes warning ya
Calling Christian and Gloria!

[Part 3: Modern World]

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

Well, I'm the class of '13 in the era of dissent
A hostage of the soul on a strike to pay the rent
The last of the rebels without a common ground
I'm gonna light a fire into the underground, well

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

I am a nation without bureaucratic ties
Deny the allegation as it's written, fucking lies

Well, I wanna take a ride to the great divide
Beyond the "up to date" and the neo-gentrified
The high definition for the low resident
Where the value of your mind is not held in contempt
I can hear the sound of a beating heart
That bleeds beyond a system that is falling apart
With money to burn on a minimum wage
Well, I don't give a shit about the modern age

I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world
I don't wanna live in the modern world

(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria) I don't wanna live in the modern world
(Mass hysteria...) I don't wanna live in the modern world

// See The Light //

Well I crossed the river
Fell into the sea
Where the non-believers go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface
In the mouth of hell
Running out of service in the blood I fell

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well I've been wasted
Pills and alcohol
And I've been chasing
Down the pool halls
Then I drank the water from a hurricane
And I set a fire just to see the flame

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well I crossed the desert
Reaching higher ground
Then I pound the pavement to take the liars down
But it's gone forever, but never too late
Where the ever after is in the hands of fate

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

// A Quick One, While He's Away //

[I. Her Man's Been Gone]

Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

Her man's been gone
For nigh on a year
He was due home yesterday
But he ain't here

[II. Crying Town]

Down your street your crying is a well-known sound
Your street is very well-known throughout your town
Your town is very famous for a little girl
Whose crying can be heard all around the world

[III. We Have A Remedy]

We have a remedy
You'll appreciate
Don't need to be so sad
He's only late

We'll bring you flowers and things
That'll pass your time
We'll give him eagle's wings
So he can fly to you

Fa la la la la la
Fa la la la la

Little girl, stop your crying (Stop your crying...)
Ivor the Engine Driver's gonna make you feel alright

[IV. Ivor The Engine Driver]

My name is Ivor
I'm an engine driver

I know him well
I know why you feel blue
Just 'cause he's late
Don't mean he'll never get through

He told me he loved you
He ain't no liar, I ain't either
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver

[V. We'll Soon Be Home]

We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
Soon be home
We'll soon
We'll soon, soon, soon be home

We'll soon be home
We'll soon be home

[VI. You Are Forgiven]

Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang

Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello

I don't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me?
Am I back in your arms?
Away from all harm?

It's like a dream to be with you again
It's like a dream to be with you again

I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the engine driver's lap
Laid with him, and had a nap

You are forgiven, you are forgiven [ad-lib]

You are all forgiven

// Another State Of Mind //

Well, I'm in another state, another state of mind
I wish that I could be there right next to her
Well, this road leads to this, and this one leads to that
Her voice sends shivers down my spine

These scars in my flesh
I'm bruised and I'm bloodied
Only she knows the pain
That I've been through

Talked to her a thousand miles away
There's tears in her eyes
If I make it back I'm gonna show her
She's the only one for me

Hitch a ride on the wild side
It's real hell on wheels
There's gonna be a fight tonight
I know

Another city we can't find
Another city left buried behind
As I picture her
The cities burn away

These scars in my flesh
I'm bruised and I'm bloodied
Only she knows the pain
That I've been through

Talked to her a thousand miles away
There's tears in her eyes
If I make it back I'm gonna show her
She's the only one for me

These scars in my flesh
I'm bruised and I'm bloodied
Only she knows the pain
That I've been through

Talked to her a thousand miles away
There's tears in her eyes
If I make it back I'm gonna show her
She's the only one for me

// That's All Right //

Well that's all right, mama
If that's all right with you
Well that's all right, mama
Just stand the way you do
Well that's all right
That's all right
That's all right
Now Mama, any way you do

Well mama she done told me
Papa then told me too
Son that girl you foolin' with she ain't no good for you
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right
Now mama, anyway you do

1, 2
1, 2, 3, 4!

Stop when the red lights flash, baby!

Dadadoodeedoodee
Dadadoodeedoodee
Dadadoodeedoodee
Dadadoodeedoodee
I need your lovin'

That's all right
Mam, any way you do
That's all right
That's all right
That's all right

// Like A Rolling Stone //

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, "Do you want to make a deal?"

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Ah, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal

How does it feel
Ah, how does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

// Lights Out //

Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
There goes the day
And this fear that comes won't go away

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)

Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell
Lights out
Finding my way
Did I waste my time losing the way?

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)

Lights out!

Lights out
Here comes the night
As the darkness falls over the light
Lights out
I lost myself
In the space between heaven and hell

And I'm losing track of time
In the corners of my mind
And I'm living out my private suicide (Lights out!)
