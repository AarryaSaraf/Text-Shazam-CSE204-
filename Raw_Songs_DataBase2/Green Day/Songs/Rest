Hey, can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
That gleam in your eye
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head

Angel, (Angel!) dancing away
As all of my thoughts get rearranged
Angel, (Angel!) turning away
Just when things
Seem to have changed

So I can rest my head

Hey, can you hear me?
I'm calling your name
Hello, or is this goodbye?
That gleam in your eye
It troubles my brain
Will I see it again?

So I can rest my head
So I can rest my head
