I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so

Everybody's gotta push me
Push me around
Everybody tried to put me
Tried to put me down

All messed up, everyone
I've already had all my fun
More troubles are gonna come
I've already had all my fun
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody tried to push me
Push me around
Everybody tried to put me
Tried to put me down

I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of anything
I'm an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know
Everything you know
It disturbs me so
