I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies, and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short, and my blood pressure is high
I lose control, and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts, and I fly off the wall
I self-destruct, and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
I hate myself, and I'm all wound up
Loss of control, and I'm all wound up
I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!

Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut, and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure, it'll never come back
Loss of control, and I get myself all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps, and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion, panic attack
I slipped a gear, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Well I'm afraid now that I'm all wound up
I hate myself, and I'm all wound up
I like myself, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!

I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies, and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short, and my blood pressure is high
I lose control, and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts, and I fly off the wall
I'm on the run, and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum, and I get myself all wound up

I lose myself, and I'm all wound up
Loss of control, and I'm all wound up
Panic attack, and I'm all wound up
Well I got fed up, and I'm all wound up
Shuh!
