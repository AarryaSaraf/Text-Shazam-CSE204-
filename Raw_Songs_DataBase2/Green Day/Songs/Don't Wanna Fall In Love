Don't want to have you hangin'
Around me like a leech
I think you're just a problem
So stay the hell away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And now, I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love

Don't need security
I ain't no dog without a bone
Don't have no time for love
So stay the fuck away from me
Because I don't believe in you

And now, I wanna sit here all my life alone
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love

This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little rough
Don't wanna fall in love
This may sound a little fucked
Don't wanna fall in love
