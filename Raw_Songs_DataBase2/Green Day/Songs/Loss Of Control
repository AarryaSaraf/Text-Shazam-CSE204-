Wow!

I'm takin' down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless
A bunch of shit-talkin' drama queens, and they're all filled with excuses
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion
I'd rather go to a funeral than into this high school reunion

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But now you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control

Hangin' out all by myself, at least I'm in good company
Hey, isn't that ol' what's-his-face that I see walking down the street?
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say
We never had anything in common, and I never liked you anyway

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But when you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch
And you're a stupid motherfucker serving shit to the pigs

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control

April fool, thought you were falling in love
But now you're suckin' on the doorknob that I slammed in your face
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime
And you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time

'Cause we're all crazy, you're all crazy, now
Well, we're so crazy, you've all gone insane
A loss of control
A loss of control
