You got a problem you just can't hide
Compulsive habits that never seem to die
Your breath is taking up all the air
Your teeth are rotting to black holes in your head

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied

Your mother allowed you just one white lie
But now she's dead and she left you with a problem
Pinocchio has pierced your tongue
Your nose is growing into the third dimension

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied (Uh, you lied)

Well reality is due
What you say just can't be true
When the story's stretched and so far fetched
That you're lacking an excuse, you lied
