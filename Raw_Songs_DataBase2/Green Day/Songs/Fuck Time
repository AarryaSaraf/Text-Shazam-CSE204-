Oh, drop your laundry and slam the door
I want your love, so give me more
I'm a beggar but I don't want a dime
Ahhhh

Oh baby baby
It's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed, WHOA

Oh Amanda Jones, your holy grace
I want to choke you 'til you're blue in the face
Got dirty thoughts and a dirty mind
Ahhhh

Oh baby baby
It's fuck time
You know I really wanna make you mine
Oh baby baby, it's fuck time
There's nothing left to say yeah
Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
Ahhhh, ahh, ha-ha-ha, yeah, WHOA

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed

Take a look into my eyes
I wanna hold you 'til you're paralyzed
