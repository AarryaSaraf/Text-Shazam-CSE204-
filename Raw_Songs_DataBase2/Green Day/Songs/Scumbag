You come around every now and then
Your clothes look different, but you're still the same
Why else would you come here?
Scumbag on a mission
You're telling me that it's been a while
Shit eating grin and a brand new life
Somebody let you come here
Scumbag with permission

Never thought I'd see the likes of you around this place
What's the special occasion? Did you run out of friends?

Here you are coming 'round again
And things are different, but you still pretend
You've got a reason to come here
Scumbag with ambition
And now you're telling me that things will change
And that you'll be leaving in a couple days
You're gonna change the world someday
Scumbag with a vision

It must be nice to know you got it all figured out
But from where I'm sittin'
It's just the same thing again and again

You need to stop to think before you open up your mouth
'Cause every time you do
It's the same thing again and again
