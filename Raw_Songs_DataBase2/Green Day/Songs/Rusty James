This whiskey's sour, amateur hour
Raise your glass and toast your friends
Someday, we will fight again, well
Your enemies, your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at?

And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound, alright!

This broken scene is turning green
And brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living
I wanna ride on the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang, man?

And all the losers
Can't even win for losing
And the beginners
Don't even know what song they're singing

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound

So long
You didn't even say a goodnight
So long
There's nowhere to go when you're hiding in plain sight!

Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
Well, there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break (Whoa-oh-oh)
When it doesn't even pound
