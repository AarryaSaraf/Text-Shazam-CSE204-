Bring me back to an hour ago
Time stands still as the years go by
Brown-eyed girl
That's throwing down a bottle of Olde English
Back in the warehouse

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16

Asleep on the floor on cardboard
Stab out my heart like a dartboard
Brown-skinned girl
That I dream about a long, long time, now
From the Midwest to the beach

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16

Say wha?

Old days are fine
But are left so far behind
From California to Jane Street
The kids are alright
Alright as they'll ever be
'Cause you will always be my
Well, you will always be my
You will always be my sweet 16
