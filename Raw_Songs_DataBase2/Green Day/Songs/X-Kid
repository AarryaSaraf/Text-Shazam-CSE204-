Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
And you're numb to your own glory, even now it's gone

I fell in love, but it didn't catch your fall
And then I crashed into a wall
And then I fell to pieces on the floor
Now you're sick to death

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out again

I once was old enough to know better
Then I was too young to care, but who cares?
I probably would, but Hollywood is dead and gone

You fell in love, but then you just fell apart
Like a kick in the head, you're an X-Kid
And you never even got started again

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out

And you were searching your soul
And you got lost and out of control
You went over the edge of joking
Died of a broken heart

Hey, little kid, did you wake up late one day?
And you're not so young, but you're still dumb
You're an X-kid and you never even got started again

Bombs away (Bombs away)
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over
Hey, X-Kid, bombs away
Here goes nothin', the shouting's over and out
Over and out, over and over and out
