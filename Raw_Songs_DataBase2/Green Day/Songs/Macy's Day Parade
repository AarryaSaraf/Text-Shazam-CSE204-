Today's the Macy's Day Parade
The night of the living dead is on its way
With a credit report for duty call
It's a lifetime guarantee
Stuffed in a coffin, 10% more free
Red light special at the mausoleum

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed to you
What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope

When I was a kid, I thought
I wanted all the things that I haven't got
Oh-oh, but I learned the hardest way
Then I realized what it took
To tell the difference between thieves and crooks
Lesson learned to me and you

Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted

What's the consolation prize?
Economy sized dreams of hope
Give me something that I need
Satisfaction guaranteed

'Cause I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout the only road
The one I've never known, and where it goes
And I'm thinking 'bout a brand new hope
The one I've never known
'Cause now I know it's all that I wanted
