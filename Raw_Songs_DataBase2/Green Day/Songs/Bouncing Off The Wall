Concrete dream (Hey!)
I'm gonna make a scene
The radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

Bombs away (Hey!)
It's just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn't sweat it
Everybody's bouncing off the walls

I'm bouncing off the walls

Alright

Concrete kiss (Hey!)
Come on and do the twist
The radio
My little exorcist
We're all getting pissed
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

I'm bouncing off the walls

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
