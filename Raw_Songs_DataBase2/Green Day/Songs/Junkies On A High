My mama said to me
"You're gonna have your enemies
Don't beg, don't follow"
I've heard it all before
I smashed my fingers in the door
My downward spiral, oh yeah

Rock 'n' roll tragedy
I think the next one could be me
Heaven's my rival
I sing in revelry
I got my own conspiracies
What hides in shadows? Oh yeah

Junkies on a high
Get back, lay down, go low
Subdivision smile
Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up
As we watch the world burn
As we watch the world burn

I'm not a soldier
This ain't no new world order
My path, don't follow
My name is "Nobody"
My pride is my pornography
Kool-Aid's my motto, "Oh yeah!"

Junkies on a high
Get back, lay down, go low
Subdivision smile
Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
Oh yeah, burn (Junkies on a high)
As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)
Oh yeah
