Sometimes it gets real hard
And I need some kind of output
For an input twice the size of my one inch mind
So slap me on the hand
Put it right back down my pants
Turn me right around, kick me in the ass

Well, today, I say sweet things, but tomorrow
I'll be making up excuses for my actions
'Cause it's been so long since I have been in love
A special kind of feeling
Guess my best excuse, I'm on the wagon again

Well, today, I say sweet things, but tomorrow
I'll be making up excuses for my actions
'Cause it's been so long since I have been in love
A special kind of feeling
Guess my best excuse, I'm on the wagon again
Well, I got no real excuse, I'm on the wagon again

Hey! (Hold on)
