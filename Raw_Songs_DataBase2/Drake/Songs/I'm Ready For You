R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya

Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soaking in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you saying no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waiting for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Nothing on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define "fast"
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm with it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's something that you thought about

I-I, I'm ready for ya

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
