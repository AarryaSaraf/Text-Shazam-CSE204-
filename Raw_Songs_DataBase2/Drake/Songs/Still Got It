I feel good I got some time off, girl it's been so long
Did you have fun? 'Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
What you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I feel good I got some time off, girl it's been so long
Did you have fun? 'Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt, but how real is that
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still
