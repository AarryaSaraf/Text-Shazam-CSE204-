Album: WakingTheFallen

// Waking The Fallen //

Wake the ones and rise tonight
Fallen souls we shine so bright

Rise now and ever
Leave your memory

Rise now and ever
Leave your memory

No one can touch us

// Unholy Confessions //

"I'll try," she said as she walked away
"Try not to lose you."
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
"I'll be here waiting." tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me."

Nothing will last in this life
Our time is spent constructing
Now you're perfecting a world... meant to sin
Constrict your hands around me
Squeeze 'til I cannot breathe
This air tastes dead inside me
Contribute to our plague
Break all your promises
Tear down this steadfast wall
Restraints are useless here
Tasting salvation's near

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

"I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
When time soaked with blood turns its back
I know it's hard to fall
Confided in me was your heart
I know it's hurting you, but it's killing me."

// Chapter Four //

Give me your hand, (Conceived and born was one of light)
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man (Rain and dark, the other born black night)
Punishment too great to bear
Raise your head, and taste the courage
(The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brothers eyes tonight

Give me your hand, (Conceived and born was one of light)
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man (Rain and dark, the other born black night)
Punishment too great to bear
Raise your head, and taste the courage
(The one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy night
I've come here to kill you
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance
I closed my brothers eyes tonight

It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands, to my brothers grave
You took his side, you took his gift
Feel the power of a fallen man
Crestfallen man

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go

Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit

Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go

// Remenissions //

With this ink in our skin we've sealed our fate
And the axe comes early (only naturally)
So what does that matter?
There's a bed of skeletons waiting for me on the other side
They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)
Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog
(Nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype
Belief, structure built up in you
I'll tear you down and the one who created you

If they didn't have One how would they act?
If we didn't have hope how would we behave?
Would they still feel remorse if they slaughtered innocent beings?
Or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane?

A good friend once told me, you are our memory
Without them we equal nothing
And all I can see is the place I want to be
Suddenly my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Night's coming fast, sun's going down
But keep away from me

Keep away from me
(It's hard, to keep me in this place)
Keep away from me
Keep away from me (Keep away from me)
Keep away from me
We may have created the beginning, mentally
We may have created the beginning, physically
To the end of our human existence

I see through you
The fear that's in your eyes

A good friend once told me, we are our memory
Without them we equal nothing
All I can see is the place I want to be
Timeless my life was so free
Leaves at my feet, blown to the ground
Their echoes are reaching my ears
Night's coming fast, sun's going down – confused
I don't know the answers but neither do you

// Desecrate Through Reverence //

Hard news, taken harder, don't look to me
Disappointed, we don't agree, we don't need your praise
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Never asked you to like me
We don't need your praise (we won't play your games)
Look down on me, spit in my face
You're nothing to me
Not to me

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by
No one will care what happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)

My presence won't be ignored, no not today
Don't walk in my direction, turn the other way
(Don't look my way for help, from the beginning you came to me)
Asking questions, predetermined answers
You won't find them here (we don't want your praise)
And I don't want you, I won't let you think
Compromise is near
'Cause it's not near

Darkened eyes you'll see
There is no hope, no savior in me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)
Learned from years gone by
No one will care what happens to me
(Don't look this way, don't breathe this way
Don't stare this way, anymore)

I'm alone in here
No more feelings
Killed my fears
Don't ask
You'll never know
You're left behind and I'll be exposed

Far away, you keep on trying
Holding me down, breaking away
Trying to distance my life
Not one in the crowd, one with the answer
One that could change your mind
But it's not true, I don't need you
Don't waste your time and don't waste mine
I'm not your friend, won't soothe your soul
And in the end, you're all dead to me

// Eternal Rest //

Black enchanting eyes
Cut through my heart
With no regret or sign of life
They tear apart my pride
And cold runs through my veins
I feel their stare from miles
Haunting every step
And they won't stop hunting me down
Forget the time will come
When all around me's burned
And you'll still see me there
Asking where you went to
And what person brought you here
And why you left the burning children
Cold out in the night
And calling for you all alone

Dark in their hearts
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
(Holding me down)

They'll find you alone
And your desperate and villainous ways
Turning their hearts into stone
They seek more than vengeance
Look in their eyes your pain is their satisfaction
Look in their eyes and see the darkness take hold
Lives controlled by faith (waiting for)
Tired of your parade (waiting for)
No sign of fair chance (waiting for)
Burn for the rest of time (waiting)
Hear the haunting words (They'll find you alone)
Lost children with no heart are crying (Turning their hearts into stone)
And you're the lost mother they're calling
Go now, run and hide (seek more than vengeance)
I hear them crying at night (your pain is their satisfaction)
Outside when the planets are falling (for the rest of time)
They want to feel and know you hear them (Go now, run and hide)

Dark in their hearts
I can feel it burn inside of me
Tormented young with no souls, haunting me
Pain in their lives all they know is misery
Take these chains away that are holding me down
(Holding me down)

Go now
Run and hide
Eternal rest in time
Eternal rest in time

// Second Heartbeat //

We keep writing, talking and planning, but everything's changing
We all know what to do but no one does it
Now this time has passed and full of regret

Two in my heart have left me a while, I stand alone
When they get back, it won't be the same

(Never be the same)

My life, you've always been there
Now you're gone, and my head's spinning
Left the childhood, left the memories, left the good times in the past
Moving on your time has run out

Wishing the clock would stand still, the world can wait
Wasting away once again, once lived as friends

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

Never will I forget you, and all the memories past
So rarely I get to see your face
Growing I looked to you in guidance
We knew that time would kill us, but you're still so close to me

To me you were my life
To me you were my soul companion
Now you are so far away
Nothing can take away the times and the memories we had

Come back – to the days when we were young
Come back – to the days when nothing mattered
To the days when nothing mattered

And I feel time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

As time passes by, regrets for the rest of my life
The ones who I confide were gone in the black of the night

// Radiant Eclipse //

Two nights ago I was shot
A bullet sunk straight through my skull
A friend pulled the trigger that silenced me
No pain as I awoke, but dead
Seeing the face of the man
The time as he lays down his gun
I knew this was going to take place
White silence, so peaceful, so numb

No one knows the time they're changing
No one will see through

You're all gone to me (gone to me)
I've been pulled out to watch from my eternal sleep
Intuition and a warning to believe (I will believe)
Something was wrong and though I felt I had to stay
Moving on seemed to be somber bliss
Without one goodbye
I watch my mother shed tears

No, this gun has stopped time in its tracks
Has altered the course of my fate
Destiny is shattered and timeless
Closed eyes feel the cold wind's embrace

I'll watch you call, calling for me
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes or look away
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings
Descending entity in me

My voice has been taken from me
The more I listen, the more I have to say

(And taste the blood that she cries)
(And taste the blood that she cries)

I'll watch you call, calling for me
You can't bring back time
Close your eyes or look away
Fate exposed, won't let me stay
Hope will fall tonight with broken wings
Descending entity in me

// I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1) //

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me
I cared for and loved

It's building up inside of me
A place so dark, so cold, I had to set me free
Don't mourn for me, 
You're not the one to place the blame
As bottles call my name I won't see you tonight

Sorrow sank deep inside my blood 
All the ones around me
I cared for and most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me or cry while I'm away

Cry alone, I've gone away
No more nights, no more pain
I've gone alone, took all my strength
But I've made the change,
I won't see you tonight

So far away, I'm gone. 
Please don't follow me tonight
And while I'm gone everything will be alright

No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight
No more breath inside
Essence left my heart tonight

// I Won't See You Tonight (Part 2) //

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide...suicide

I just want to die, take away my life
Lay by your side, please

Come back to me, this is unconceivable
Breaking apart the ones you love
Hate runs deep for what you've done to us
Left alone through suicide

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

Nightmare – full of pain
Nightmare – full of pain

I look back and see the twisted road
Best friends and despair took its toll

Take away
Take away
Take away
Take away

You can't be replaced
I'm left alone with you
In spirit and the words
You wrote to me

Sorrow, sank deep inside my blood
All the ones around me, I cared for
And most of all I loved
But I can't see myself that way
Please don't forget me
Or cry while I'm away

Look at my face you pierce with a blank stare
No dream could prepare a heart for a lifeless friend
He's gone. Nothing will take back time
I need him back, but nothing will take back time

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

I can see just fine with you in my life
And there by my side as it starts to fade
I know this can't be right, stuck in a dream
A nightmare full of sorrow

// Clairvoyant Disease //

Dust begins to fall to the ground
(And you sit there and do nothing)
The air is cold and thin
(You're content with doing nothing)
Thoughts are haunting me as I look around
(But in my life, I wanted more)
This will never end, when I'll bleed forever
(This will never end)

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far – it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

Outside shell is strong – confident
(There is nowhere to run and hide)
But slowly eats away
(Stuck alone inside your head)
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
(Guess you're better off dead)
Through my pores it seems to seep
(Your mind bleeding)
When I'll bleed forever

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far – it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

And you sit there and do nothing
You're content with doing nothing

There's nowhere to run and hide
When you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head
Better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house
No one's around

Don't acknowledge right, just dwell on wrong
This spot in hell's where I belong
I've come so far – it's been so long
Don't know why it started or where it came from

But in my life, I wanted more
I needed more, I taste more

// And All Things Will End //

Lived through you
Safe with how we lived our lives
With how it all turned out
(But things are bound to change)
Uncovered lies, surfaced throughout
Will make you change your mind

Sometimes life is altered
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

When I see you, I can read it in your eyes
Fate misunderstood
(But things are bound to change)
Swallowed the lies, can't blame you for
Thinking with your heart

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

I see my world crumble and fall, before my eyes
I know, I know
Dark will turn to light, in time I'll be alright
I know, I know
(I never imagined my life could turn out this way
So cold so black so alone)

Living goes by fast, catch your breath
And it will pass you by
And it won't last, to sulk with the memories you hold

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

Sometimes life is altered
Break from the ropes your hands are tied
Uneasy with confrontation
Won't turn out right. Can't turn out right

// Waking The Fallen: Resurrected //

Rise now and ever
Leave your memory 
Wake the ones and rise tonight 
Fallen souls we shine so bright 
Rise now and ever 
Leave your memory 
No one can touch us
