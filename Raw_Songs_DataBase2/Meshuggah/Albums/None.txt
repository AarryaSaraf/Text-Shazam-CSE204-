Album: None

// Humiliative //

I'M THE CONCRETE LEPER SICKNESS REPULSION EMBODIED BUT HEAR THE
SERMON ESCAPING MY VERMIN MOUTH YOU MIGHT EVEN STAY WITH ME
IN THE DIRT I'M SOAKED IN PUTRID SEWAGE RISEN FROM EMPTY WORDS
TO YOU A LEGION OF NAUSEA I'M YOUR SINS I'M YOUR CROWN OF THORNS
I'VE SEEN THE BLOOD OF GENERATIONS THE RAVENOUS MOUTH CALLED
SYSTEM WE'RE ALL SHAPED BY VULGAR HANDS THE GRIP OF HATE AND
LIES THE SUSTENANCE TO OUR BELLICOSE WAYS AN IGNORANCE ALMOST
JUSTIFIED AS THE GAP OF HUMANITY FRACTION GROWS THE SKULL OF
LIFE LOBOTOMIZED HEAR ME I'M IGNOMINY THERE'S NO RENAISSANCE IN
BLEEDING NO I'VE FLOWN A MILLION MINDS BLACK IN DESPAIR THE
LIQUIDS OF UNCERTAINTY SPIT INTO THEIR EYES OUR FLESH EMBEDDED IN
COUNTERS OF INIQUITY IT SEEMS LIKE WE ARE ALL JUST MERCHANDISE
NOT CIVILIZED NO WORDS WE ADAPT IN OUR SILENCE PARALYZED TO
CHANGES ERASING THE LAST DENIAL LINES ATTITUDES CRUCIFIED STILL
WE'RE GOING ON CRAWLING TOWARD SUBMISSIVE SUICIDE

// Sickening //

NOONE KNOWS THE SOUL OF TEARS AND WHY CAN'T WE SEE HUMAN
INDIGNITY WHO WILL LAUGH AT THE GROWING SUFFERING THE BLEEDING
RAPIDLY BREEDING INCREASING THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON BEFORE US
CONSTANTLY RUNNING HYPNOTIZED ENERGIZED BY NAIVETY TAKE A PICK
AT RANDOM CHOOSE OUR FUTURE TO BE CRAWLING IN THE MESS OF
STUPIDITY WE WON'T HEAR WHEN WE'RE DEAD AND GONE WE TRUST IN
LIES OR A FAKE PARADISE ARE WE BLINDED TIL' THE BITTER END DECIDED
OR MAYBE VERY MISGUIDED TRAVELLING THROUGH ENDLESS TIMES
INSIDE OF NOTHINGNESS REACHING FOR A NEW BELIEF IN VAIN INSANE
OUR MOLDED LIVES AN EVER CATATONIC FLOW WE'RE REJECTED EVER
MORE BY LUCIDITY WHY STRANGE WHY WHY CHANGE WHY NOT SUICIDE
NO STRANGE NO NO CHANGE NO NOT SUICIDE WITH EARS THAT ARE SHUT
TO THE INNER VOICE WE'RE GIVING IN TO THE SHATTERING TELL ME HOW
CAN WE TAKE IT TELL ME WHY ARE WE HERE HANGING IN THE BALANCE OF
DECEIT AND BLASPHEMY PARALYZED IN SIGHTLESS DRAINS IGNORANT
AND STILL NO PANIC IS THERE NO WAY TO BE FREE NO WHY ME NOT US
WHY NOT BLIND STRANGE BLIND BLIND CHANGE BLIND SUICIDE DAMN
FAITH DAMN DAMN LIES WHY

// Gods Of Rapture //

I FEEL TORN APART A VILE MISFIT FALLEN 
DEEP INTO AFFLICTION OF MY HOLLOW MIND 
THE SENSE OF SUFFOCATION GROWS INSIDE MY LUNGS
WHEN I WAKE INTO TRUTH I'M BACK AMONG THE BLIND 

THE TRUTH OF LIES DISENCHANTING MY EYES 
HOW CAN I SURVIVE I CAN'T STAND BEING 
ALIVE...ALIVE...
GODS OF RAPTURE ENSHROUDING MY EYES I TRY TO HIDE 
THEN SLOWLY I DIE 

MY PAST LAUGH AT ME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF NEGATION
UNTYING THE LASTING FEW CORDS OF COMMON SENSE 
SUBMERGED INTO THE FLOW THE RAPIDS OF ADDICTION 
TOO WEAK TO PUSH IT BACK A WORM WITHOUT DEFENCE 

MY FLESH FADING UNDRESSING THE BONES BEHOLD ME NAKED 
CADAVER EXPOSED THIS MY ABUSE I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE 
THE FRAGILE TRUTH SNEERING AT ME WITH TEETH PRESSED
LIKE THRUSTING NAILS INTO MY HEAD ALL MY LIFE I REGRET
