I'm the shallow, the superficial. I'm the common man. faithless, narrow minded, indifferent, impassive.
A sycophantic leech. tantamount to disintegrity. I'm the vulture feeding on malignancy.

I'm the sin, the lecherous sneering at prostration. I wallow in disease. I rejoice at degradation.
I yawn at misery. Spit at others happiness. An advocate of manipulation. I embrace the sickening.

I'm the lost. I'm average. I'm common. I'm infection. I'm human. I'm common
A worm thriving in seas of disgust. I'm common. The mouth licking what you've bled. I'm common

I'm the pampered degenerate. I indulge my inclinations
The only words to my attention are those that I my self create
Disorder. Chaos.

I debar all order, repudiate all purity. Infatuated by contentment.
I laugh at lies. Come behold the sickness in my common human eyes.

I'm the greed. The cynic. I'm the indifferent gaze.
Mendacity, betrayal; this is not a phase
Ebullient with human filth, here I am. Here I stay.
Flourishing in our disgrace. Blessed be the human way.
