when not being stupid
is not enough
when not being wrong 
is not enough
waited such a long time 
have I waited too long? 
in a world that's so bad 
it's not hard to feel good 
you do what you have to 
not as much as you could
just because you're not wrong 
doesn't mean that you're right 
when not being stupid
is not enough
when not being evil
is not enough
you look all around you
never look up at the stars
