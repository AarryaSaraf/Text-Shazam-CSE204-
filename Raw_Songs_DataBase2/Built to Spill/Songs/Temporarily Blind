Bet you can't tell I'm temporarily blind
And how much more can I get sunburned?
How much more can I get sunburned?
Bet you can't tell I'm temporarily blind

Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

The thought of you waiting for someone
Turn your back on this hating, turn your back on this hating
Before I forget it took so long
Turn your back on this waiting, turn your back on this waiting

I need to know where you're coming from
Turn your back on their framing, turn your back on their framing
Who history doesn't teach, it makes numb
Turn your back on their taming, turn your back on their taming

Yeah, they might let let you say it
But it'd take all day to explain it
