Saturday I jotted down some words I cried
All about a girl that I thought I loved
Told the story of what we did and what went wrong
You've heard it all before its the same old shit

So I won't bore you with all the details
I'm sure that you can listen between the lines
I screwed her and she screwed me, but we never once had sex
All we ever had is too much time

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash

This part of the song is called the second verse
Sounds just like the first verse but with different words
It only has three chords and they are A, E and D
They are A and E and D
Then it goes to B minor, D
A little A, another E, then D again

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash!

Love is just a joyride
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside
Lay your foot down on the gas
Leave it there until you crash
Love is just a joyride (Love)
Drink a lot of beer and climb inside (Is just a)
Lay your foot down on the gas (Joyride)
Leave it there until you crash

Love is just a joyride
Love is just a joyride, love is just a joyride
Just a joyride, joyride
Love is just a joyride
