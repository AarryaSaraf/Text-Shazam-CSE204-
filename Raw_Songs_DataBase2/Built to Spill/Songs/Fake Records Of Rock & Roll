Get down, boogie like never before
Fake records of rock and roll
Hold on tight and don't let go
Fake records of rock and roll

When the people walk into that record store
Fake records of rock and roll

The people go shopping and they lay their money down
Fake records of rock and roll
Sounds just like, and the people don't know
Fake records of rock and roll

When they turn on that stereo
Fake records of rock and roll

Got their money and they lay it down
Fake records of rock and roll
Fork it over and they dig the sound
Fake records of rock and roll

They listen all day and they just don't know
Fake records of rock and roll

Well it used to be
You'd hear the rock and roll play
But the people nowadays
Just turn their heads and walk away
Since the day
The music died

Well it sounds just like shit to me
Fake records of rock and roll
The ruin of history
Fake records of rock and roll

Can't even get down and boogie
Fake records of rock and roll
