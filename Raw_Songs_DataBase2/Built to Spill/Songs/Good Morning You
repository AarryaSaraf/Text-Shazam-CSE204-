Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way
Good morning you
Had to stop to think of something to say

You sat in the chair and you were there
You looked at the wall and started to stare

Good morning you
What do you plan to do?
Good morning you
Though you can hardly move

You sat in a chair and you were scared
There's so much you could do if you dared

Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way?
Good morning you
Had to stop to think of something to say

Good morning you
You've got the world, what's in your way?
