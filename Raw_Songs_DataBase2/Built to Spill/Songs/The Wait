You wait
You wait
You wait for summer
Then you wait for rain

You wait
You wait
You wait for darkness
Then you wait for day

Yeah, you wait
You wait, you wait
And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience, it will come

You wait
You wait
You wait for August
Then you wait for May

You wait
You wait
You wait to get up
Then you wait to play

You wait
You wait
You wait for something
That'll make the waiting worth the wait

You wait
You wait
And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience, it will come
