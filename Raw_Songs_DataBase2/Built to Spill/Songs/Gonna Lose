Don't you believe what you wanna see
Your mind keeps playing tricks on me
I wasn't sure 'cause you never know

Gonna lose your mind
Gonna lose your mind

What could be more disorienting
Than being on acid in a dream?
Thought I was done with that kind of fun

Gonna lose your mind
Gonna lose your mind

Now you know it's what you know
Yeah, you know it's what you know
Yeah, you know it's what you know

I've come to realize time's all wrong
Answers materialize then they're gone
They were here, but the ones like that
Disappear and they don't come back

Tell me again about this memory
Are you sure you didn't just see it on TV?
Do I need to tell you what you're gonna lose?
