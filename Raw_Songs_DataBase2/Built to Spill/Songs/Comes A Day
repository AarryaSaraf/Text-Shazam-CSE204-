Comes a day no one gets away
Nothing stays forever
Comes a time when nothing comes to mind
Nothing's fine forever
Life is long when waking up feels wrong
Think of how it's gone forever
Comes a day we'll never be the same
Something's changed forever

There is no, no, no more time left
There is no, no, no more time left

Comes a day nothing will remain
Nothing stays forever
The blind can see all eternity
The deaf can hear forever
Comes a day nothing gets away
No one ever stays forever

We can never know that
We can never show that
We can never understand why
How can you be for this?
How can we ignore this?
How can we be so blind?

I am not a shirt
I am not a shoe
You don't have to ever put me on
And for the record
I am not a record
Don't put me on
Did you ever wander?
Did you ever wonder?
Did you ever understand why?

And you'll never know 'cause you'll never know what's real
We're all paralyzed with life
And when you realize you can realize what's real
Isn't there something we can bide besides our time?

Well we think we know a lot of stuff
But this knowledge is really rough
We can read and write just enough to lie about it
You say it's lonely at the top for you
With no one to share the view
Well it's lonely at the bottom too
It's just more crowded

And you'll never know 'cause you'll never know what's real
We're all paralyzed with life
And when you realize you can realize what's real
Isn't there something we can bide besides our time?

I never wanted to be so lame
It just ended up happening
The only reason I did anything was to be loved
And staying cool when things are bad
Takes more courage than I ever had
So easy to just get mad
And how can you still complain?
There's no reason to explain
What we all go through is not the same
