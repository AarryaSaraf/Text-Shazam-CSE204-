I cannot believe it took so long and we got so little done
Maybe I could see it, if we spent some time joking in the sun
Tried the easy way, it didn't work so we had to do the right way
But if you believed, then I guess you had to be let down

But how could we know that?
How could we have known that?

I cannot believe it took so long and we got so little done
Tried and tried and tried and tried and tried, ooh...
