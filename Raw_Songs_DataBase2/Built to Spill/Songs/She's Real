I could try anything not a smile used to be
and you can tell your heart good bye
I know, I know,
I know your heart don't lie
tell me why
I wanna hold on to you when you smile
you're breakin me
don't know how
you put this change in me

I used to be so cruel
but now it's you who's breaking all the rules
tell me why I wanna hold on to you
tonight is much too hot to sleep and I walked all night
just sitting drinking on the church step
five o'clock, five alone, girl
I'm still walking down the river to east river park
two armchairs in the dark...
I'm waiting for the six o'clock
I was sleepless
second avenue
everybody's out tonight
eight five at half past two
but you're sleeping by yourself

she's real, she's real
I know our love is real
from a block away
I can see her shades drawn down and tied
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
one and only...
be my,
be my baby now...
