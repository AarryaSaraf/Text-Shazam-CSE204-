Don't wanna be free of hope
And I'm at the end of my rope
It's so tough just to be alive
When I feel like the living dead

I'm giving it up so plain
I'm living my life in vain
And where am I going to?

I've gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
And where am I going to?

I don't know where is up or down
And there ain't any love left around
Everybody's wearin' a frown
Waitin' for Santa to come to town

You're giving it up so plain
You're living your lives in vain
And where are you going to?

You've gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
Where are you going to?

Flip on your TV
Try to make sense out of that
If we were all in the movies
Maybe we wouldn't be so bored

We're giving it up so plain
We're living our lives in vain
And where are we going to?

We gotta really try
Try so hard to get by
And where are we going to?
