Swimming down the river white
Into the ocean blue
And in a cave beneath the ocean floor
You find another you

You feel the ground beneath your feet
Makes you feel so strong
But when the earth
Begins to quake
You know there's something wrong

You feel the breeze at your back
It makes you feel so bold
But when the wind forgets your name
The world can be so cold

Up in the stars
Up in the sky
Another world abounds
And I don't know just what it means
But I like the way it sounds

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
