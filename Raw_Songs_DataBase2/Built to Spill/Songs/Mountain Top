On top of a mountain top
I stoop and thought one day
I could really see a lot
And if I had my way

A lazy young sod I was
So deep in love those days
As if there was nothing was
But only love I crave

And so I didn't know as much
Her loving touch amazed
I was so gone with love
The alphabet was a haze

So alone as she pulls away
The funeral truck I cried
I gazed the clouds away
Like a Lost Christmas that day

And now I can't seem to cope
But only hope some way
Just to see her once more
And we could be friends like way back when

It's as if I'm already dead
And in my grave I lay
If only her love could save me now
And if some how she'd stay
