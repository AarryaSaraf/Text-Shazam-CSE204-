// Cortez The Killer //

He came dancing across the water
With his stalleons and guns
Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun

On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
With the secrets of the worlds

And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colors
For the angry gods to see

And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on

Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones

They carried them to the flatlands
And they died along the way
But they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today

And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

He came dancing across the water
Cortez, Cortez
What a killer

// Forget Remember When //

For a better tomorrow
Forget remember when
Better not borrow
Memories from them

There's a hole in tomorrow
So forget remember when
History hollow
Carved out by them

Deep enough to fit
All of us in

How much time's wasted on
Words and thoughts I know are wrong
There isn't a choice except to stop
Thinking there isn't a choice

How strange that there's rain
But how could you have known

// Now And Then //

Now and then, sometimes when you're thinking
About when you were always drinking
And how friendships came in one evening
You loudly pretend connecting had some meaning

But now you don't, 'cause you can recall
Why you were possessed
To say something like
"Come along with me and find a new direction, one that can't deceive us."
Like they first said on TV

And now you don't
'Cause you can

// Virginia Reel Around Fountain //

You told yourself something funny the other day
You said you can't make you laugh
How can that be in your solid state?
How can that be in your solid state?

Don't say no, just say you don't know
How can that be in your solid state?

As you make it unreal
I'm reeling around the fountain
I'm reeling around the fountain

I still confide in you almost every day
Even though you're not around
How can that be in your solid state?
How can that be in your solid state?

Don't say no, just say you don't know
