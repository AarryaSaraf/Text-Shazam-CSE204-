// The Plan //

The plan keeps coming up again
The plan means nothing stays the same
But the plan won't accomplish anything
If it's not implemented

Like it's always been
And it makes me think of everyone
And the cause of this is evident
But the remedy cannot be found
'Cause it's so well hidden

// Center Of The Universe //

I heard what I said to you
And it was so out of sync
With the way I wanted to
Make myself out to seem

I don't like this air
But that doesn't mean I'll stop breathing it
Who doesn't think they're at
The center of the universe, being it

Don't look now
Just keep watching the TV
Hating what's to see
Waiting for someone to say something that's right

I heard what I said to you
Thought it was all understood
But I wasn't getting through
I'd go on if I could

I don't like this air
But that doesn't mean I'll stop breathing it
Who doesn't think they're at
The center of the universe, being it

Don't look now
Just keep watching the TV
Hating what's to see
Waiting for someone to say something that's right

// Carry The Zero //

I'm not knocking your want to carry that home
Took it with you when you moved and got it broke
Found the pieces, we counted them all alone
Didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero

I can't be your apologist very long
I'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on
Count your blemishes, you can't, they're all gone
I can't see your response putting them back on

Like they're waiting for your guard to fall
So they can see it all and you're so
Occupied with what other persons are
Occupied with, and vice versa

And you've become what you thought was dumb
A fraction of the sum
Yeah, you've become, yeah, you have become
A fraction of the sum, the middle and the front

And now it's coming back
Hasn't it come too far?
I was trying to help, but
I guess I pushed too hard

Now we can't even touch it
Afraid it'll fall apart

// Sidewalk //

Come on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?

The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you
What hasn't changed for you

Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Waiting for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?

Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?

Come on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?

The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you
What hasn't changed for you

Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Waiting for you
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?

Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk?
Can it wait for you?

// Bad Light //

Never forever, what I think is true
Never forever, what I hope to do
Never forever, what I got from you
Never forever

Never forever, what I think is true
Never forever, what I hope to do
Never forever, what I got from you
Never forever

And all that sun makes so much shine
How this is done, like so much science
Can't be explained through common sense
Takes a firm background in remembering

And it takes some math
And there's so much more
It's so hard to read in bad light
It's so hard to see in bad light

It's so hard to see in bad light

// Time Trap //

It's barely yours on loan
What you think you own
The place that you call home
The ideas in your bones

In your bones

This would still feel dumb
Back where you're from
Do you, do you want to change your mind?
Do you want to change your mind?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap, in a time trap

Guess that's all fair now because
Guess that's all there ever was
Grey and sprawling
Save your crawling

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap, in a time trap

Do you want to save your life?
Do you want to save your life?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap, in a time trap

// Else //

Finally I don't mind
Worthless tries at finding something else
Best not talk too loud
You're not as smart as you require of them

Your body breaks
Your needs consume you forever
And with this lies
The need to be here together

Funny thing with blood
You try to stand but neither leg's awake
Just this side of love
Is where you'll find the confidence not to continue

Your body breaks
Your needs consume you forever
And with this lies
The need to be here together

// You Were Right //

You were wrong when you said
Everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, you were wrong when you said
Everything's gonna be alright

You were right when you said all that glitters isn't gold
You were right when you said all we are is dust in the wind
You were right when you said we're all just bricks in the wall
And when you said manic depression's a frustrated mess

You were wrong when you said
Everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, you were wrong when you said
Everything's gonna be alright

You were right when you said you can't always get what you want
You were right when you said it's a hard rain's gonna fall
You were right when you said we're still running against the wind
Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone

You were right when you said this is the end

Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?

// Temporarily Blind //

Bet you can't tell I'm temporarily blind
And how much more can I get sunburned?
How much more can I get sunburned?
Bet you can't tell I'm temporarily blind

Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?
Isn't everyone?

The thought of you waiting for someone
Turn your back on this hating, turn your back on this hating
Before I forget it took so long
Turn your back on this waiting, turn your back on this waiting

I need to know where you're coming from
Turn your back on their framing, turn your back on their framing
Who history doesn't teach, it makes numb
Turn your back on their taming, turn your back on their taming

Yeah, they might let let you say it
But it'd take all day to explain it

// Broken Chairs //

Broken chairs your body conforms to
Out beyond the quieted garden
You can bring the man form into trust
Through the holes in my everydayness

Lends sustenance where starvation's necessary
'Cause my head's a dictionary
Of long spring days and the speech of crows
Who themselves are mirrors of apprehension in the fallen sun

Where starvation's necessary
'Cause my head's a dictionary
Of long spring days and the speech of crows
Who themselves are mirrors of apprehension in the fallen sun

Who themselves are mirrors of apprehension in the fallen sun

Well, alright
You can make it stay
Well, alright
Well, alright

Well, alright
You can make it stay
Well, alright
Alright

Alright
Well, alright
Alright
Alright
