// When Not Being Stupid Is Not Enough //

when not being stupid
is not enough
when not being wrong 
is not enough
waited such a long time 
have I waited too long? 
in a world that's so bad 
it's not hard to feel good 
you do what you have to 
not as much as you could
just because you're not wrong 
doesn't mean that you're right 
when not being stupid
is not enough
when not being evil
is not enough
you look all around you
never look up at the stars

// One Thing //

there's one thing you've gotta remember 
there's two kinds of people in this world
there's three words you should never say 
there's one thing you should never do
there's two good reasons to live
there's only three ways to get things done 
four, counting 'do it yourself'
(and they're...)

// Shit Brown Eyes //

I've one thing to tell you
before I die
just wanted to tell you
you were
right

// She's Real //

I could try anything not a smile used to be
and you can tell your heart good bye
I know, I know,
I know your heart don't lie
tell me why
I wanna hold on to you when you smile
you're breakin me
don't know how
you put this change in me

I used to be so cruel
but now it's you who's breaking all the rules
tell me why I wanna hold on to you
tonight is much too hot to sleep and I walked all night
just sitting drinking on the church step
five o'clock, five alone, girl
I'm still walking down the river to east river park
two armchairs in the dark...
I'm waiting for the six o'clock
I was sleepless
second avenue
everybody's out tonight
eight five at half past two
but you're sleeping by yourself

she's real, she's real
I know our love is real
from a block away
I can see her shades drawn down and tied
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
be my baby...
be my,
one and only...
be my,
be my baby now...
