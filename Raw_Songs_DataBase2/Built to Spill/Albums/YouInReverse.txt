// Goin' Against Your Mind //

People think when you don't understand
What it takes to wanna be a man
I don't care much for that
I don't know why

Just a fight or just a waste of time
Hiding things that no one wants to find
I don't know much of that
I don't care why

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

When I was a kid I saw a light
Floating high above the trees one night
Thought it was an alien
Turned out to be just god

If you're not sure who not to believe
Who has better reasons to deceive?
They're really good at that
That's all they do

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

And we won't share
No, we won't share
And we won't share
No, we won't share

// Traces //

Daylight can never really hide what's alive
I know it's hard sometimes
For you to tell where you end
And where the world begins

You do your best to avoid assimilation
Guess that's the best you can do
And all the parts of it that matter change
All traces disintegrate

At night
My mind gets on this
Train of thought
And can't get back off

And when you know
How few things there are worth knowing
I suppose
Anyone who tries could forget

Responding now
To trains that crash before you
Never thought
Crashing could happen to you

And all the parts of it that matter change
All traces disintegrate

// Liar //

I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

When things are all you think of
And plans are all you make
And thoughts are all you dream of
Your falls are all you take

Look out, the world's destroying you
Relax, it isn't fair
Mother nature's disposition
She don't mind, she don't care

She don't mind, she don't care

I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

Passing over, passions pour
Passing everything

I would only be a liar
No, I would only be a liar
If I told you that

It takes up all of your life
These decisions you make
It takes up all of a day
Making them all

Well, outside on the patio
The piano's weeping too
Forget about it all for a little while
She don't mind, she don't care

She don't mind, she don't care
She don't mind, she don't care

And I wouldn't be a liar
No, I wouldn't be a liar
If I told you that
I wouldn't be a liar

You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor to me
You see, it seems minor

// Saturday //

You waited for Saturday
And waited for my birthday
And most of us probably
Expect even less than that

And I'm glad
You're not like us
And by us
I mean everyone in the world who isn't you

All this time I thought was mine
Your proximity made
When boredom comes, it won't be long
Before I sing to you

There's nothing you can do
There's nothing you can say
To make my problems go away
Or to make me do the same

From the outside
My dealings
Pour me outside
Bottled feeling

For a mountain
Marbled ceiling
Commence the healing

// Wherever You Go //

Murals make it right, well, how can that explain?
Nobody can tell what the hell they're even saying
No one sees it's easier to change
No one sleeps and no one stays awake
No one complains

And I'll find wherever you go
And I'll help with things you don't know
And I'll get you out of the show
And I'll find wherever you go

It's things you have to give and never come around
There's opportunity to tread instead of drown
Remarks will make the living settle down
They call them markets instead of towns
They like how it sounds

Most of us are wrong
Most of us agree
Must have been the wrong
Message we received

If you gotta choose, I've gotta change
And if you've got the truth, I've gotta trade
And if you've got a feud, I've got a fade
My heart will wear you out

Yeah, my heart will wear you down
Yeah, my heart will wear you down
Yeah, my heart will wear you down

// Conventional Wisdom //

Sometimes life surprises
'Cause you'd never expect it to be that
Dangerous disguises
That you never expect to see

Some things never change
Nothing's gonna change that
Some things you can't explain
Like why we're all embracing conventional wisdom in a world that's just so unconventional

Made you turn around
But you never expected to see that
That's what makes that sound
That you never expect to hear

Some things never change
Some things wanna change that
Some things you can't explain
Like why we're all embracing conventional wisdom in a world thats just so unconventional

They don't know they're wrong
But you know that they never can see that
That's what makes them strong
That they know that we'll never see

// Gone //

Hey, where were you today?
How did you escape?
The way no one gets away
'Cause no one's gone

Fate guided me to hate
Invited me to take the bait
Realized too late
That I was gone

Say, how can you explain
Person to the pain
And then sickness to the sane?
But it's all gone

Most of us get riled up
Justify the lies that we believe
Not enough to disbelieve them

I've been thinking you've been treating
Situations seemingly unkind
Stockade seems to still be working

Change of heart
Save yourself
So damn long

I get ashamed
So much sound
I kiss the ground

// Mess With Time //

Come on
Whats to decide?
Reveal your life
Mostly with lies

Review
What you have done
I know it's gone
Back to its sun

Finally
Something to say
Back to their lies
Not to their face

Where to
Go for your life
Back to your fire
But you don't try

Well, oh well, your mind
Still a mess with time
How can you unwind
When my hands are tied?

// Just A Habit //

He's more farce than father
He's more of a dog than dogs are
It depends, we're just dots and commas
I'd still say you got one on us

There's no reason for it
Don't despise it and don't adore it
It's just a habit
It's just a habit I formed

This one's a super sonic
This one's got too much on it
This one's a freak
This one's for free

There's no reason for it
Don't despise and don't adore it
It's just a habit
It's just a habit

// The Wait //

You wait
You wait
You wait for summer
Then you wait for rain

You wait
You wait
You wait for darkness
Then you wait for day

Yeah, you wait
You wait, you wait
And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience, it will come

You wait
You wait
You wait for August
Then you wait for May

You wait
You wait
You wait to get up
Then you wait to play

You wait
You wait
You wait for something
That'll make the waiting worth the wait

You wait
You wait
And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience, it will come
