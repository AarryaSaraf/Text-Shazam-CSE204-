I knew that something was missing
I knew that something was wrong
But I never knew that you wouldn't stay
Who would have thought it would turn out this way
I knew there were unanswered questions
And I knew there were unspoken words
But I never knew the right things to say

Oh, who would have thought it would turn out this way
(Who would have thought) it would turn out this way

Oh, I knew there were lapses in judgment
(I knew) I knew there were serious flaws
But I never knew that my blue would turn gray, no
Who would have thought it would turn out this way

I knew there was room for improvement
(I knew) I knew there was work to be done
But I never knew the price I would pay
Who would have thought it would turn out this way
(Who would have thought)
Who would have thought it would turn out this way

There's a long road to run
To lead my heart into the sun
Holding on would mean it's too late
I've still got time oh, but time won't wait
No

Now I know that life is a blessing
Now I know that life is a gift
I learned my lesson and my life is OK
But who have thought it would turn out this way
(Who have thought) it would turn out this way
Who have thought it would turn out this way
