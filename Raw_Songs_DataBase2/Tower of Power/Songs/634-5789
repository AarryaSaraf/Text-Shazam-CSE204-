If you need a little lovin' call on me
Said if you want a little huggin' call on me
That's what you got to do now
Oh, I'll be right here at home
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And dial baby 634-5789, 634-5789

If you need a little huggin' call on me
That's all you got to do now
If you want some kissin' call on me baby, alright
No more lonely nights you'll be alone
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And dial now 634-5789, 634-5789

Oh, I'll be right there just as soon as I can
If I be a little bit late I hope that you'll understand

If you need a little lovin' call on me, Lord have mercy
Said if you want a little kissin' call on me, alright
No more lonely nights you'll be alone
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And call me 634-5789, 634-5789, 634-5789, 634-5789

634-5789, 634-5789...
