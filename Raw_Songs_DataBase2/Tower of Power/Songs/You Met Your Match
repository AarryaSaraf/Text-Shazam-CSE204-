Hey, yeah

You were good at playing the fox, girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hound for nobody
Girl, just wait till I get you home

I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

Oh baby

You played around with Jimmy and Freddie
Tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Suzie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel, babe

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met your match
When you played with my affection
You met your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
You met your match
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell from the vine, vine, vine, vine

Your mama told me that I'd better be mellow
She said, "You're just a baby, maybe too green"
I told her, "Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and big Joe
They knew better, mama shake off that dream"

Hey, I told her that you really were cooking
My love is burning, for turning to steam
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match

You played around with Jimmy and Freddie
Tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Suzie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel, babe

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

Hey babe

You met your match
When you played with my affection
You met your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
You met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match, you met your match
