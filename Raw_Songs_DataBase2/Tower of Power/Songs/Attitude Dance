If you're feeling kinda shy
Don't even wanna try
Your dancin' can improve
With a little attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you're feeling kinda low
Don't even wanna go
Even if you change your mood
With a little attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Just cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

If you want to shake your hips
It don't have to be no trip
Break down and bust a move
But with an attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you want to throw a shake
Don't make a great escape
Adjust your point of view
Just add some attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Just cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

If you getting in the swing
You can really do your thing
And become the baddest dude
With the meanest attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you've got a certain style
Even if it's kinda wild
Most anything will do
With the proper attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Don't cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

What it gonna be like, when you begin
What it gonna be like, I'll be working like ten
What it gonna be like, when you take a chance
What it gonna be like, in the attitude dance
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

What it gonna be like, when you break the ice
What it gonna be like, gonna feel real nice
What it gonna be like, why don't you take a chance
What it gonna be like, in the attitude dance
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance
