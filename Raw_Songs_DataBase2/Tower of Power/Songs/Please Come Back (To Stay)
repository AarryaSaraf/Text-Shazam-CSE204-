All those people
It's just not the same
But all things considered
I was to blame
Since I insisted, on playing my game
You walked out
Walked right out of my life

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back to stay

I never suspected
I'd feel so alone
With things in perspective
I should have known
Somehow I got here
All on my own
You walked out
Walked right out of my life

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back
Darling, please come back to stay

Let me love you the rest of my days
Oh, baby, come what may, ah

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back to stay

Yeah yeah, please come back to stay
Yeah... (please come back, please come back) come back, baby
Please come back to stay, baby

Come back to stay baby, yeah yeah
Please, please, come back to stay
Just let me love you
Oh, I just wanna hold you baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
