I don't need for you to be here every minute of the day
And I don't even need you darling, to wash my blues away
That's not to say that I don't love you heart and soul, cause I do
And every night I want to be there next to you

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

I don't ever want you feeling that your dreams can't come true
And I won't ever stop you sweetheart from doing what you have to do
Just make sure that we don't ever let our love get off the beam
And we will always be together to share our dream

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

(Sleeping with you baby)
(Sleeping with you baby) next to you
(Sleeping with you baby) yeah
(Sleeping with you baby) you and me, baby
(Sleeping with you baby) ooh
(Sleeping with you baby) I just love sleeping next to ya baby
(Sleeping with you baby) oh
