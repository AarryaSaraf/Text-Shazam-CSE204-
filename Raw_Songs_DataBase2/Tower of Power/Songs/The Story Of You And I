Oh
You, you took me to the cleaners
You hung me out to dry
(You) You really couldn't have been much meaner, honey
(Oh you) didn't even have to try
You made me buy your lies
About you and I (you and I)

(I) Oh I should have seen it comin'
(Oh I) I should have played it smart
(I) Oh girl, I should have hit the pavement runnin'
(Oh I) Oh I should have seen it from the start
It ain't no big surprise about you and I (you and I)

I was fooled completely
You acted oh so sweetly
For a minute
Oh, for a minute and a half
I began to wonder
I might have made a blunder
Were you in it
In it just for laughs?

That's the story of you and I
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

You really had me spinnin'
You took me for a ride
(You) made me think I was winnin'
(Oh you) said you'd be right by my side
You made me buy your lies
About you and I (you and I)
Ain't that a shame

(I) Oh I should have seen right through you
(Oh I) I must have been so blind
(I) hey I really thought I knew you
(Oh I) I must have really lost my mind
Girl, there's no surprise
About you and I (you and I)

I was fooled completely
You acted oh so sweetly
For a minute
Oh, just for a minute and a half
I began to wonder
I might have made a blunder
Were you in it
Were you in it just for laughs?

That's the story of you and I
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I
Help me

That's the story of you and I (you and I)
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

That's the story of you and I (you and I)
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

That's the story of you and I
I was about to lose my mind
The story of you and I
Yeah
That's the story of you and I
Oh, I was fooled completely baby
That's the story of you and I
Story
That's the story
So sad ooh
