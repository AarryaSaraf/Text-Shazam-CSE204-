I used to feel
So very sane
So very clear
Within my brain
I never was the kind of guy
Who would ever lose it
Oh, no

But when you messed
With my mind
You know I crossed
That invisible line
And now I'm trippin' all the time
Because I'm flippin'
All the out

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
You got me going

I used to be
So down to earth
So rational
For what its worth
I never was the kind of guy
Who could ever get on
On 's way out

The things you do
Drive me berserk
And I can see
It'll take some work
I'm diggin' what you do to me
Still I'm wiggin'
Oh way down, oh

You got me going crazy
Going crazy

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
Got me going crazy, yeah, yeah

I know why
I want you so much
You got that look
And you got the touch
There's nothing left to prove
Girl you move me
And you groove me

You got me going crazy
Going crazy
...

Crazy, crazy babe
(Crazy for you)
Yeah, going crazy
(Crazy for you)
...
