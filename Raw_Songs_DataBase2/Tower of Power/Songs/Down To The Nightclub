It's Saturday night and I'm just hangin' out
Lookin' for a place to party
I jumps into my ride and I hits the road
Cause there's only one place to go

Down to the nightclub, ooh
The women be righteously ready and pretty
To the nightclub
We go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump (Bump City)

Sitting by the dance floor checking it out
Watching the man with the fast feet
He got the hippest threads and the bad boogaloo
And a big old bag of tricks

Down to the nightclub, aha
You can get what you want if you know how to find it
To the nightclub
Ooh, we be slick, slick, slick

Ooh, the people be bumping (at Bump City)
The joint be jumping (at Bump City)
The mamas be humping (at Bump City)
Hey, while the band be pumping
Said the band be pumping
The beat be something
Ow, one time y'all

The night's almost gone and we're still going strong
The party's been so hearty
I hope it doesn't show while I'm driving down the road
That I had too much to drink

Down to the nightclub, well
If you've got the dough, the liquor will flow
To the nightclub
Tied on a drunk, drunk, drunk

Down to the nightclub, we go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump
Down to the nightclub, we be slick, slick, slick
Down to the nightclub, we go bump-ty, bump-ty, bump
Down to the nightclub, tied on a drunk, drunk, drunk

(Down to the nightclub) Well, if you've got the dough, the liquor will flow
(To the nightclub) Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
(To the nightclub) Look here, man, you get what you want if you know how to find it
(To the nightclub) C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
(To the nightclub) Yeah, yeah, Lordy, yeah
(To the nightclub) Look here, y'all, the women be righteously ready and pretty, hee-hee
(To the nightclub) Alright, now, now
(To the nightclub)

Down to the nightclub
Bump-ty, bump-ty, bump
