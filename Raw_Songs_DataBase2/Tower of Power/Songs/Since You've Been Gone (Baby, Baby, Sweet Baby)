Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips, but not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray, darlin'

Hear me now (Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Hear me)
Got to get you back somehow (Hear me now)

I'm trying
Take me back, consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Well I've been so lonely

Baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips, but not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray, oh babe

Do you hear me darlin' yeah (Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Hear me)
Got to get you back somehow (Hear me now)

Oh baby
Take me back, consider me please
If you walk through my door
I can get up off my knees
I just feel so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet, so sweet darlin')
Since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet, so sweet darlin')
