I've been looking everywhere
I felt lost and lonely
Out of nowhere
There she was in front of me

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

(I, I found a love)
I found a love
(She is good)
So good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

There's no looking back
I thought I'd lost my soul
Got my life back on track
And then I gained control

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

I found a love
She is good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

I found a love
She is good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

Found a love, woah
(She is good)
So good
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams
Yes so good
So good to me
I never, never in my wildest dreams

(Never, never never)
(Never, never never)
Never knew a love like this before

(Never, never never)
(Never, never never)
So good
(In my wildest dreams)
She's so good
(Never, never never)
In my wildest dreams
