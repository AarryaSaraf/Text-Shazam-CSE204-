(Maybe it'll rub off)
This feeling that we got
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might decide to get hot
(Maybe it'll rub off)
This here jungle beat
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Make you slip on out your seat

Just might rub off
Just might rub off

(Maybe it'll rub off)
This music that we feel
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might have mass appeal
(Maybe it'll rub off)
This so called pagan rhythm
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Just might decide to get with 'em

Just might rub off
Just might rub off

It might seem strange to some of you
But it's a well known fact
We have compensated for
The pigment that we lacked
We always dug on rhythm and blues
We ain't putting on no act
So open up your mind
Open up your eyes and ears
And then to your surprise
It may be more than it appears

(Maybe it'll rub off)
This groove is gonna set you straight now
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Not too late to skate and gyrate
(Maybe it'll rub off)
Unless rubbing is a sin
And if it don't rub off
We're gonna rub it in, yeah

Just might rub off
Just might rub off
This music we feel
Is so for real
