I've been to heaven before
But I must have been too young to realize
I would've stayed there
If I had known about my paradise

What a time to believe
I could make it on my own
What a lesson to learn
Widen up, you're all alone

I tried to run away but I just
Keep comin' back to you
I keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do
I keep comin' back to you

There was a time in my life
When everything was all about change
I'm not ashamed to admit
There's one thing that still remains the same

All the stars pave a way
All I did was think of you
All the love that I missed
Now I know just what to do

I tried to run away
But I just keep comin' back to you
I keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you, baby, baby
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Tell me that nothin' is changed
Tell me you want me to stay
I keep comin' back
Keep comin' back

I try to runaway but I just
Keep comin' back to you
Said, I'm gonna keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do
