One can have a dream baby, two can make that dream so real
One can talk about bein' in love, two can say how it feels
Well, one can wish upon a star, two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark, two can make the light shine through

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery, yeah
Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar drinkin' all alone by herself
Two can make that lonely place seem like somewhere else

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

It takes two, it takes two baby
Just me and you, me and you
It takes two

It takes two

And one can go out to a movie lookin' for a special treat
Two can make that movie somethin' kinda sweet
One can take a walk in the moonlight thinkin' that it's really nice
Two walkin' hand in hand adds such a touch of spice

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two, us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you
