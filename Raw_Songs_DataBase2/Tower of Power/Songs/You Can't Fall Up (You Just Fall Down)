You can be in love or be out of love
But never never ever fall in love
Because you can't fall up, you just fall down
And all you hear is that lonely sound
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

You can be in love or be out of love
But never ever slip and fall in love
Have you ever fallen and not been hurt
By the sudden impact when you crash to earth
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

You can be in love or be out of love
But never take a slip and fall in love
'Cause when you fall, you lose control
Reaching and grabbing for something to hold
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down
