Ridin' on a white horse, galloping over the clouds
That's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Do you know what I'm talkin' about
I see a big pot of gold at the end of a rainbow
Sittin' at the bottom of the sea
I could swim myself about a thousand fathoms
'Cause your kiss is like gold to me
Hear mocking birds singing, tranquilizing
See a transparent woman she's a ghost
All the wonderful things that you do to me
To say the least, you're the most
You're the most

I see a tree in the jungle all covered with fruit
No other trees around
In the desert I'm lost, it's a wall of sand
But your kiss, girl, and I'm found
Such a beautiful trip all around the world
And your love is coast to coast
All the wonderful things that you do to me
To say the least you're the most
You're the most

I see some bright red shiny balloons
Four score and ten
I see a thousand swans, a bright shiny lake
Reflecting your love again
It's an uphill climb straight down to the bottom
It's a love disease, a fatal dose
It's not enough, but it's way too much
To say the least you're the most
You're the most
You're the most
From coast to coast

You're the most
Baby, most
You're the most baby
You're the most

You're the most baby
You're the most
Sweet fine thing
Fine as you can be
You're the most, baby
You're the most
From coast to coast
You're the most, child
You're the most
You're the most
Baby, you're the most
