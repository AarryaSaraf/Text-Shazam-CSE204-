Let's do it, do it with soul
Let's do it, do it with soul

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make sure it's hot
Give it all you got
Till it's out of control

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make up your mind, get off the shelf
Don't let your life just pass you by
Stop wasting time, reapply yourself
Hey, we got pulverized and now we're back

The main thing I wanna tell you
Don't do it with no one else
Do it for yourself

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Move ahead with confidence, don't hold back
It's time to take control

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
The time is right, you better make a move
Now is the time to run away
Stand up and fight, what's there to lose
What's there to lose, you might not-a live another day

The main thing I wanna tell you
Don't do it for no one else
Do it for yourself (Ow!)

If you gonna do it, do it with soul
If you gonna do it, do it with soul
Make sure it's hot, give it all you got
Till it's out of control
If you gonna do it, do it with soul

Let's do it, let's do it with soul

Let's do it, let's do it, with soul
Move your head with confidence, don't hold back
It's time to take control

If you're gonna do it, do it with soul

Yeah do it, come on, with soul
Let's do it, oh, with soul
Yeah, do it, everybody
Do it with soul
Let's do it, with soul

Do it with soul
