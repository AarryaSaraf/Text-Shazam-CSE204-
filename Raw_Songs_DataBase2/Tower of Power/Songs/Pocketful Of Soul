I gotta get going, I gotta get gone
I'm one step away from home and one step to be gone
I gotta get moving, the message is clear
The future is clouded down here

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know I can depend on just one thing

I gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here

I gotta get serious, I can't be a clown
Gotta give up a soul cut cause it's time to get down
I gotta get in there go figure it out
That's what it's all about

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know it's up to me whenever I sink or swim

I gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here

No matter what condition my condition is in
I know I can depend on just one thing

Gotta pocketful of soul right here
(Gotta pocketful of soul right here)
I gotta pocketful of soul
(Retro rocket full of soul)
I gotta pocketful of soul right here
