He's got his
Playboy decal
On his
Corvette windshield
He's obsessed with sex
Impressed by the rich
He's been
Gainfully employed for years
Atlantic-Richfield
Writes his check
Pats him on the back
And he's

Bound just to drag that ball and chain
Bound just to drag that ball and chain
His mama don't cut this boy no slack
It's drivin' him insane
I guess he's bound and determined
To drag that ball and chain

He's got his
Plastic money
Steno honey
Lives out his dreams
On upward mobility
He said he was
Lonely once
He said he was
Lonely twice
You'd think that he'd
Look around
Check it out
What a way to live a life
And he's

Bound just to drag that ball and chain
Bound just to drag that ball and chain
His mama don't cut this boy no slack
It's drivin' him insane
To drag that ball and chain
Get back boy
This cat's
Bound just to drag...

Cross the flo'
Slap hime some mo'
Cat said

Ooom-a-little baby
Ooom-a-little baby
Draggin' that ball and chain, yeah
Ooom-a-little baby
Ooom-a-little baby
Draggin' that ball and chain, yeah
