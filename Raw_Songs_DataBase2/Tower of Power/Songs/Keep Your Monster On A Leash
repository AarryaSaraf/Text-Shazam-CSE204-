(Say people!)

Some people's let their bodies on the ground
Let their monster do the talkin' all night long
Some people drink and drink till they pass out
Some people don't know what I'm talkin' about

It's very easy
His own to each
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
Yes you do

Some people paint their bodies black and blue
Let their monster get creative, yes they do
Some people like to spike their oily hair
Some people like to lose, they just don't care

Hear what I'm saying?
Just listen to the words I preach
You've got to keep your monster on a leash, yeah, yeah
You've got to keep your monster on a leash

(Listen!)

If you borrow
From tomorrow
Your future will be grim
If you really love your monster
You don't wanna have to do him in
Just keep your monster on a leash
Keep your monster on a leash

Some people almost die to go get live
Let their monster take control and take a dive
Some people spend their paychecks to get well
Some people can't relate, but what the hell

It's very simple
Stand up on your own two feet
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
You've got to keep your monster on a leash, yeah, yeah

If you borrow
From tomorrow
There's trouble on the way
So you better leash your monster
Or there's gonna be hell to pay
Just keep your monster on a leash
Keep your monster on a leash
(Haunt!)
Keep your monster on a leash
(Hit me!)

Take 'em on a walk
Some who might
On a leash
Oh, yeah!
Your monster on a leash

Oh, get a grip on your Godzilla
Go ahead, go ahead and hold hands with rodans
On a leash
Keep your monster on a leash
