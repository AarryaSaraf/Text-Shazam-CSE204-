I know that you want me
Lord have mercy
Look in my eyes
(Lord have mercy)
You can't hide your feelings
Too revealing
You can't deny
(Can't deny)
I know that you want me
Lord have mercy
Look in my eyes
You can't hide your feelings
Too revealing you can't deny
(Can't deny it baby)

I know that you want me
Lord have mercy
Look in my eyes
You can't hide your feelings
Too revealing
You can't deny
I know that you want me
Lord have mercy
Look in my eyes
You can't hide your feelings
Too revealing you can't deny
(Can't deny it baby)
Look in my eyes
