I had to compete
In the concrete jungle
Had to kick and scratch
Stab some backs, in the jungle

At first I had a honest dream
Then the dike broke through
The scheme I had so gently planned
It suddenly fell through

Now I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)

It's a cold blooded world
When you ain't got a dime for a phone call, in the jungle
Makes me feel so bad
To be standin' in the welfare line

My so called friends of yesterday
They don't even know my name
And if I get a second chance
I do believe I'll feel the same

I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)

Ain't a single soul
That could keep control of my actions, in the jungle
Living in the streets
Makes a man turn to desperate ways

Right now I'd just be runnin' wild
There's no place for me to go
The look I wear up on my face
Let's everybody know

That I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back, back (back, back, back on the street again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)
I'm back, back, back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
Makes me feel so bad (back, back, back on the streets again)
To be back on the streets again (back, back, back on the streets again)

Fell asleep in the park last night
Sunday paper pulled up tight
Hope the law not hip to me
What's before me imitate
Ridin' on this big machine
Back on the streets again
I'm back, back, back, back
Back on the streets again
Back, back, back, back
