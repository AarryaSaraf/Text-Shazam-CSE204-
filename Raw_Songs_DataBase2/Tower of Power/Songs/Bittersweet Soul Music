I can hear a bitter melody
Thinking of the love I left behind
All the pain of love became a song baby
Still the sweetness lingers on

That's why I've got this bittersweet soul music to sing for you
Nothing but bittersweet soul music through and through

Love is such a fragile thing to bear
If you've found it handle it with care oh no no
It's so easy for a heart to break now
It only takes just one mistake (one mistake to make)

That's why I've got this bittersweet soul music to sing for you
Nothing but bittersweet soul music through and through
That's why I've got this bittersweet soul music to sing for you
Nothing but bittersweet soul music through and through

I should have been all through after the love we knew
Ended in such bitterness and pain yeah ah
But if I could relive one sweet moment with you ah
I would do it all over do it all over again

And so the story goes my whole life through
Love affairs will end then start anew
And when the pain of love becomes a song
Then the sweetness lingers on

That's why I've got this bittersweet soul music to sing for you
Nothing but bittersweet soul music through and through
That's why I've got this bittersweet soul music to sing for you
Nothing but bittersweet soul music through and through

Yes I do I got music for you girl
Every day now
Bittersweet soul music
I've got I've got this music
Yeah yes I do for you girl
Bittersweet soul music
