When I see your face lying next to me at night
I can't help but wonder why it doesn't feel right
Pretty as a picture, warm as summer sun
I don't understand why I feel I've got to run

I know you love me no matter what I do
I just wish I felt the same way that you do

Let it go, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now
Eh, to thine own self be true
Let it go, ooh-ooh, that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, oh, it's better that way

I look into your eyes, the truth is what I see
You and I together, that's not our destiny
Don't wanna face it, but it's long overdue
Gotta stop pretending, it's just not fair to you

Gonna take some courage to say what's on my mind
But in the name of true love, let's leave the past behind

Let it go, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now, alright
To thine own self be true
Let it go, ooh-ooh, that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, it's better, better that way

Let it go, let it go

Gonna take some courage what's on my mind
In the name of true love, let's leave the past behind
Who knows what we're gonna find

Let it go, oh, that's all I can do
Let it go, right now, let it go, gotta be true
Let it go, come on, 'cause that's all I can say
Let it go, this time, it's better, it's better that way
Let it go, got to let it go
Let it go right now, hey, hey, oh now baby
Let it go, ooh-ooh
Let it go, this time, I can't help it, what am I gonna do
Let it go, I've got to let it go
Let it go, right now, oh, oh na na
Let it go, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Let it go, this time, let it go, let it go
Let it go...
