Trouble is, she's very fine
Trouble is, she's way out of line
Trouble is, she's very smart
Trouble is, she ain't got no heart
She wants her way, she wants her say
And if you play, she'll make you pay

And if you look to Miss Trouble
You'd best be gettin' gone
She's lookin' to strike you out
Correct me later if I'm wrong
If you're lookin' for the fast ball
She'll throw you a curve
She's always there for last call
Miss Trouble's got a lot of nerve

Trouble is, she's very likable
Trouble is, she's likely to go psycho on you
Trouble is, she's very devious
Trouble is, she's most mischievous
She's out to win, she'll do you in
She'll play you like a violin

Trouble is, she's very sneaky
Trouble is, she's four-star freaky
Trouble is, she's very live
Trouble is, she's all the way jive
She'll jack you up, and don't change the tire
She'll get you hot then put out the fire
