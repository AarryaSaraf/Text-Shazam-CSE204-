(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)

Down on my knees
Oh, heart in hand
I was accused of being too young
But I'm not so young
Can't you understand
That I think like a man

(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time) oh, no, no, baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
I'm not wasting my time
(Don't waste your time)

Back once again
Ooh, just begging you please
Darling, think twice about me
'Cause I'm not so bad
I could make you happy
I'm not a mad lad

(You're too young to love) If you and I could be together
(You're too young to love) I'd get to you through any weather
(You're too young to love) I love you, yes I love you only
(You're too young to love) I'll never, never leave you a-lonely
(You're too young woo-ooh) No, I won't, sweet lady
(Don't waste your time)

The damage is done
You'll see that you were wrong
You'll wake up wondering just
How well I've done
Well, I've done all right
Yes, there are some girls
But you know I'd drop them on sight
Just for you
Because I love you

(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
(Don't waste your time)

I'm not a young man, baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
And I don't feel that I'm wasting my time
Not when it's you, girl
You better believe
(Don't waste your time)

Someday you'll understand just what it means
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
When a man comes to you
With his little heart in his hands
Just to love you
(Don't waste your time)

Just to get up next to you and hold you, oh baby
(You're still a young man, baby, woo-ooh)
You say that I'm wasting my time
Well, it's my time, baby
(Don't waste your time)
It's you-you-you, you-you, you-you
You better listen to me

Sayin' I'm loving you, yeah
Yeah hey, yeah hey, hey now, baby
Tryna tell you that it's you-you-you...
Talkin' to you, baby
I'll never never, never never
I'll never never do you no wrong, no no, lady
If you would check my stuff out one time, haha
Just to hold you, just to squeeze you
And all I wanna do is to get next to you
And please, please, please you, baby
You can see it where I'm comin' from
