The other night I was thinking
Of going out, doing some drinking
I didn't think of what I was doing
Another step, I might be ruined
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I'll admit it, I'm not too clever
I might've died, I guess I better wake up
'Cause it looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Come on, now, sing it
Stop it (Stop it)
Oh

It's been a while that I've been lucid
I haven't done nothing stupid
I can't say I ain't been tempted
Believe it or not but they accepted
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I admit, I'm not too clever
I could've slipped, so I better wake up
'Cause it looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Hey yeah, I better, better
Stop yeah (Stop it)

And this may be my one and only chance to get it right
Hey, I don't wanna lose it all without putting up a fight
So I might just wanna stop, ow!
Ooh!

Play it, boy!

Without a doubt I'll be lucky
It could've been really yucky
No excuse, just quit trying
Drop the ball, no use in lying
(Blinded by foolish pride)
I'll admit, I'm not too clever
I might've died, I guess I better wake up
It looks like it's time

To stop (Stop it)
Oh
Better stop yeah (Stop it)
Listen

Then this may be my one and only chance to get it right
Oh, I don't wanna lose it all without putting up a fight
So I might just wanna stop

(Stop it)
Oh I know I gotta stop, yeah (Stop it)
Hah, it won't be too long before I'll be gone (Stop it)
If I don't stop
Oh yeah (Stop it) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(You better stop) (Stop) (Stop it)
Oh, don't go down that road no more
(You better stop)
Think about stopping now (Stop it)
It might be time (Stop it)
(You better stop)
Gotta get it up together (Stop it)
It's for my own good (Stop it)
Wake up (Stop it)
Before it's too late, ooh (Stop it)
(You better stop)
All the time (Stop it) Right now
Oh stop it (Stop it) Right now
(You better stop right now)
I'm gonna, I'm gonna stop
