Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Life's a bowl of cherries
Just waiting there for you
But they may not taste as sweet
As you expect them too

The grass is always greener
On the other side of the room
But there's one thing to remember
When the rose has lost it's bloom

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Life can disappoint you
When you get too selective
It can bring you down tonight
It's a question of perspective

One mans got a meal
While the other ain't got enough
You can't take it with you
When it's all said and done

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Make it funky, make it funky, make it funky...
Make it funky, get down funky you'll...

If you take it all for granted
It might not work out that way
Now I understand it
What mama used to say

Life is what you make it
You can bend but do not break it
Life is what you make it
(So make it funky)

Make it funky, make it funky, make it funky...
