Politicians promise all they can
To get elected, to make a better land
In a smoke filled room, they're makin' all their plans
But when the smoke gets clear, you know it's just a scam

I'm just an average ordinary kind of guy
Punchin' in at nine, punchin' out at five
Doing all I can to pay the bills on time
No matter how hard I try, I just can't get by

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Weapon systems, national defense
Vested interests, it doesn't make no sense
What we think we get, ain't always what we get
They keep raising all our taxes, but we get deeper, deeper in debt

I'm just an average ordinary kind of man
Slightly underpaid, tryin' to understand
No matter what I make it's never quite enough
I want to do my share, but it just ain't fair

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes
