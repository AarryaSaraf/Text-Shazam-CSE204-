You may win, you may lose, no matter what the choice, you gonna have to choose
Keepin' up with the Jones's, is not a wise course
You gotta build your own road, tell the man to join
Hmm, it's all so simple, HA, it really is
It's a well known fact y'all, that what you put out is what you get

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back

Got a problem, put a damper on your day
Confusion all around, you can't find your way
Ooh funky words fallin' from your mouth
It's like a lot of excuses, you're just lyin' to yourself
WAKE UP, life's too short
Such a silly game, only thing you win is a crying shame

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back
Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back

So many people, so many try, to hide what they feel inside
I won't play that game, I must admit I tried
I'd rather die now, than live the lie

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back
Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back
