Hey hey hey

Look at me baby
Didn't take no time at all
For me to learn my lesson
Like you told me that I would

I got to have a clean slate baby
I'm goin' to wipe away all my mistakes
I got to have a clean slate baby
I'm goin' chalk up all the points

Face the facts sweet mama
I love you and you alone
Just got to get your head together
We goin' ease on out town

If I could get a clean slate baby
I believe I'd wipe away all my mistakes
If I could get a clean slate baby
I'm goin' chalk up all the points

I'd love to be your main squeeze
Do all my hanging out at home
I'm goin' treat you right mama yes indeed
I ain't gonna cop no plea by telephone

I got to have a clean slate baby
I'm goin' to wipe away all my mistakes
I got to have a clean slate baby
I'm goin' chalk up all the points

One more chance
Is all a man wants
One more chance
Is all a man needs

Clean slate
One more chance this man wants
Clean state
One more chance this man needs
Clean slate
I got to have a clean slate
Clean slate
I'm gonna make it right
Clean slate
I'm gonna stay home late at night
Clean slate
I'm gonna fix it baby
Clean slate
I'm gonna pay the bills
Clean slate
I'm gonna fix your ills
Clean slate
Hey ahhh
Clean slate
One more chance
Clean slate
