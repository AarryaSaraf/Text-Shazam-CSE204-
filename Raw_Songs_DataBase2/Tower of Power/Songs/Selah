I was on my merry way
To the happily ever after
I thought I had it all figured out
Then pain replaced the laughter

Like a bull in a china shop
I destroyed everything I'd see
I had to learn it the hard way
I'm not the master of my destiny

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right
I don't know

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Say it again
I ain't never going down that road again
No

My friends tried to warn me
I was just too blind to see
But I was bound and determined
And as wrong as I could be

Thought I knew what I had to do
I was sure I would have it all
It hit me like a ton of bricks
Pride goes before the fall

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right
I don't know
Ho-ho!

Selah,
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Let me say it again
I ain't never going down that road again
No
No, no, no

Selah
Selah
Oh yeah

'Cause it all comes crashing down
Sooner or later
Forced to face defeat
Is it time for flight
Or stand and fight?
For what is right, I don't know, I don't know

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Let me say it again
I ain't never going down that road again

Selah
Can I get an Amen?
I ain't never going down that road again
Selah
Oh yeah
I ain't never going down that road again
No, no, no, no, no

Selah
Selah
I ain't going down that road no more
Not me
Uh-uh
No
I ain't going there
