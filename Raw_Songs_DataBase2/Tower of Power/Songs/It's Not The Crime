I broke the law last night
Committed a criminal and sexual act
She was on top in this state
I said I went to get bopped

And though I didn't get caught
I know in my mind I committed no crime
Still by some fluke I'm here serving time
Oh no

It's not the crime
And it's not the thought
It's not the deed
It's if you get caught

I got some friends who like to stay high
Think of, the tax potential, if it was legal to buy
But instead the kid is forced to bust on victimless crimes
It's the look last bust, nickel and dime, oh oh

It's not the crime
And it's not the thought
It's not the deed
It's if you get caught

Think of all them profiteers
And how they got that way
Cause they sure the hell would not be there
Without the payoff game that's played
Think of what we could do
If it was you that was in their shoes
You either play the game or else you lose
Bad news

It's not who's sold
It's not who's bought
And it's not the kickbacks
It's if you get caught

It's not the crime
It's not the thought
And it's not the deed
It's if you get caught
