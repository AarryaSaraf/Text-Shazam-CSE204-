Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

Your kiss filled with tenderness, I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes with showers
And every hour of the hour you let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder
When you came my cup runneth over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear a cryin' from above

It's 'cause heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

It's like heaven, it's like heaven
Oh, it's like heaven, now it's like heaven

I'm captured by your spell, you're different girl, I can tell
When you're layin' on my pillow baby
Above your pretty head there's a halo, that's why I know

Heaven missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

It's like heaven, girl you're like heaven
Oh, it's like heaven, in one night you're like heaven

My pretty baby, you're my darlin' angel
Oh, it's so beautiful baby, girl you're like heaven

She's so good, she's so good
I know, I know, I know, I know I love her so
Baby, baby, baby, baby you're so good

Good, she's so good, lady you're so good
She's so good
You're my sunshine on a rainy day
You're my sunshine on a rainy day

She's so good, she's so good
You're my heaven, you're my heaven
My, my pretty angel
You're my little angel
