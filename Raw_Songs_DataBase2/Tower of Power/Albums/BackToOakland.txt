They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke
They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke

// Don't Change Horses (In The Middle Of A Stream) //

Five long years
We have been together
Your love and understanding
Has brought us through stormy weather

I must admit girl
I haven't always been good
But you stuck by me
Just like you said you would

Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams

If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream

Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver

I only did the things
I thought I had to do
And if I hurt you baby
I'll make it up to you

I can't say
I haven't done any wrong
Let him without sin
Cast the first stone

Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams

If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream

Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver

Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver

Let's forget about the past
Ride to a brand new day
Jumpin' over stumbling blocks
As they wander in our way

We got to keep goin'
'Til we reach our destination
Don't let nothin'
Hinder your inspiration

Hey, I know that enough is enough
But you shouldn't be talking 'bout givin' it up
Turn it loose, it might be right it seems
The wrong decision will spoil all our dreams

If you don't want to spoil our secret dreams
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream

Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o yeah
Giddy-up, giddy-up
Hi-o silver

Don't change horses in the middle of a stream baby
Don't change horses in the middle of a stream now
It might spoil our secret dream, child
It might spoil our secret dream, baby

Ride, ride, ride, ride
Oh girl, hey, hey, hey
Ride, ride, ride, ride, oh girl

// Can't You See (You Doin' Me Wrong) //

I've tried hard to do my best
So I could stand out from the rest
I can't figure out what you're all about, no
And I'm left standing here in doubt

Can't you see
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way

There must be something I can do
To get this message through to you
Sometimes I think you're on my side
But you keep changing with the evening tide

Can't you see
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way

Girl, I wish you only knew, yeah
What you're putting this man through
I can't give up on you, no
No matter what I try to do

Can't you see, I want you
Can't you see
(You're doing me wrong)
(For much too long)
(I can't go on) this way
...

// Time Will Tell //

It's a rare occasion
When your plans and expectations
Come down just exactly how you plan them
Hey, life's just that way

You better face the facts, sweet lady
Things change from day to day
It all depends upon the situation
Who can say anyway

(Time will tell) time will tell
Oh, then we'll both know so very well
(Time will tell) time will tell

So just be patient
Until you reach the realization
You can't have joy without a little sadness, too
That's just the way it is, hey

And girl, I believe we're gonna make it
But not without our share of ups and downs
You can't expect life to be a total paradise
But if we just pray together, girl, it will be so nice

(Time will tell) time will tell
Oh, and then we'll both know so very well
(Time will tell) time will tell, oh baby
Hey, hey

(Time will tell) oh, oh, girl
Take a little time out
I'm sure that you will see, ah
(Time will tell) you just keep on holdin' on, oh love
You gon' be able to make it with me

(Time will tell) oh, oh, baby
I need you, I want you, girl
I've got to have you, ah
(Time will tell) give me your time
Just wait on me, oh, girl
There's no tellin' how happy we gon' be

// Man From The Past //

Out of the past, he came a-walkin',
and he waked right back into your life.
Ain't no need, in you tryin' to deny it girl,
cuz you know I ain't tellin' no lie.
I can tell by the look in your eye,
that the fire for him, still burning you inside.
Since he's been back girl,
things just seemed to change.
Why the other night, in your sleep, you even called out his name.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

When we first got together,
you said your thing with him was through.
I was in love, so I believed ya,
but what you said girl, didn't quite ring true.
When you were with him, he hurt you before.
Now you seem to wanna run off back for more.
Oh I just can't accept the reasons that you give,
cuz' losin' you'll make life so hard to live.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

How could you treat a good man so bad?
You went on out and ruined all the plans we had.
Girl I wish that man would let us be;
I wanted your love to belong only to me.

I thought our love would last,
but it seems I've been replaced by a man from the past.

(Out of the past, he came walkin',
and he walked all over our love)

Out of the past, he came a-walkin',
out of the past girl, he came a-talkin',
out of the past, he came a-stalkin',
out of the past child, he came a-honkin'.

He was walkin', talkin', honkin', stalkin', tamperin', on our love, oh God, oh God.
That evil man, that dirty man, he took our love,
and he crushed, it in his hand, oh God.

// I Got The Chop //

Went down in the valley
I jumped back in the alley
Scaled the highest peak
I even plugged the biggest leak

Ain't none quicker than I
Slicker than Superfly
I don't even have to try
I got the chop

I got the chop
I can't be stopped
I'll never get popped
I got the chop, hey now

I possess the keenest mind
Perhaps of all mankind
My cranium do contain
Undoubtedly the greatest brain

My sight is not the type
Baby get sucked up all night
I maintain outta sight
I got the chop

I got the chop
I've been through a lot
Give it all I've got
I've got the chop

If somehow you still have doubt as to what I'm talkin' 'bout
Your insight's extra dumb if you can't tell where I'm comin' from
'Cause if I ain't got the chop, if I ain't got the chop

Moby Dick was a minnow
Dumbo was a drunk
Popeye was a pussy
And Pinocchio was a punk
No! That's a buncha bunk

I will fulfill your every need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Double your money back
Your gonna swear I got the true knack

Ain't no haughty boast
It's a fact that I'm the most
Just the most from coast to coast
I got the chop

I got the chop
I hit the spots
Call all the shots
I got the chop

Oh, girl, I am the cream of the crop
See, I'm the most from coast to coast
I won't get popped, I can't get stopped
I've been through a lot
Give it all I got
I got the chop
Oh-oh, girl
Oh, now...
