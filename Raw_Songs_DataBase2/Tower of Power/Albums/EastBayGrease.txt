// Knock Yourself Out //

You got your fax fur on, you're walking out the door
You said you won't be around to see me no more
You'll be preaching that you put the hurt on me
But on the real side, we shall see

Talk your trash, mama, yes it's alright with me
And my game uptight and you should have known it from in front
I'm on top of the situation, babe
So knock yourself out

You've been places, girl, where you don't belong
I've been there, too, I'm not saying that it's wrong
But you tell your friends that you got away clean
But on the real side, you were just a rhythm machine

Talk your trash, mama, yes it's alright with me
And my game uptight and you should have known it from in front
I'm on top of the situation, babe
So knock yourself out

I got the urge early last week
To call you up just to hear you speak
But I really didn't want to waste my time
Because on the real side, you're not worth a dime

Talk your trash, mama, yes it's alright with me
And my game uptight and you should have known it from in front
I'm on top of the situation, babe
So knock yourself out

// Social Lubrication //

Sittin' in a room 'bout only 10x12
[?] and a candle
The room become a blue-grey haze
now ain't it a stone groove?
Until you do what they're hip to...

Social lubrication to get high
Social lubrication to laugh inside
Everyone's got their own way
Everyone's got their own way
They got their own way

Dad got his cocktail
Mom to the beauty parlor
Down to the store - fetch that cocktail
Gettin' ready for the party
now ain't it a stone groove?
Until you do what they're hip to...

Social lubrication to get high
Social lubrication to laugh inside
Everyone's got their own way
Everyone's got their own way
They got their own way

People they go to jail (To get high)
Some people they watch TV, yeah (To laugh inside)
Some people they pop them pills, yeah (To get into the action set)
Some people have to pay them bills, yeah (To be happy with themselves)
Some people drink at the local bar (An honorable institution)
Some people are happy just readin' them books, yeah (To get their satisfaction)

What people got to understand
That everybody's got his own way to get high
(Which way is better) Oh yeah
[?] old man in jail
[?] people
Who want to be mellow, their only plan being

Social lubrication to get high
Social lubrication to laugh inside
Everyone's got their own way

Everybody's got their own way to get high
To get your own way, to feel good inside
They're droppin' them pills, yeah, gettin' to the action set
They're payin' them bills, yeah, to be happy with their selves

Get your own way, feel good inside
They're goin' to church, yeah, to get high

// Back On The Streets Again //

I had to compete
In the concrete jungle
Had to kick and scratch
Stab some backs, in the jungle

At first I had a honest dream
Then the dike broke through
The scheme I had so gently planned
It suddenly fell through

Now I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)

It's a cold blooded world
When you ain't got a dime for a phone call, in the jungle
Makes me feel so bad
To be standin' in the welfare line

My so called friends of yesterday
They don't even know my name
And if I get a second chance
I do believe I'll feel the same

I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)

Ain't a single soul
That could keep control of my actions, in the jungle
Living in the streets
Makes a man turn to desperate ways

Right now I'd just be runnin' wild
There's no place for me to go
The look I wear up on my face
Let's everybody know

That I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back, back (back, back, back on the street again)
I'm back (back, back, back on the street again)
I'm back, back, back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
Makes me feel so bad (back, back, back on the streets again)
To be back on the streets again (back, back, back on the streets again)

Fell asleep in the park last night
Sunday paper pulled up tight
Hope the law not hip to me
What's before me imitate
Ridin' on this big machine
Back on the streets again
I'm back, back, back, back
Back on the streets again
Back, back, back, back

// The Skunk, The Goose, And The Fly //

Y'all heard 'bout the skunk?
He's got a lot more funk
Than any other animal - More Funk! Hey, hey, ha-hey
His walk and his goofy talk
And his funky breath, smell of brew - Yes They Do!

He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
Ooh the skunk, Ah the skunk - drunk as a skunk
Ooh the skunk, Ah the skunk - drunk as a skunk

The Goose got's a lot more soul
Then you found in fairytales - More Soul!
He slips and he slides
And then skates all around, tranquilized - Dig His Eyes!

He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
Ooh the goose, Ah the goose - loose as a goose
Ooh the goose, Ah the goose - loose as a goose

Well, the Fly, got's a lot more buzz
Always has more, brother - More Buzz! Oh yeah!
Well, he whips and he zips
And then zooms in and out, pushin' fine - Feels So Fine!

He's high as a common fly, oh me - oh my!
He's high as a common fly, oh me - oh my!
Who's a fly, High as a fly, high as a fly
Who's a fly, High as a fly, high as a fly

He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
He's drunk as a skunk, drunk as a skunk
Say, ooh the skunk, ah the skunk, drunk as a skunk
Ooh skunk, he's drunk as a skunk - yeah

He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
He's loose as a goose, loose as a goose
Ooh, ah, ooh, goose, ooh, ah, ooh, goose
Ooh-oo, love to get loose

He's high as a common fly, oh me, oh my
He's high as a common fly, oh me, oh my
Ooh the fly, Ah the fly, high as a fly
Ooh, Ah, Ooh, Ah, he loves the sky!

// Sparkling In The Sand //

When God made you
He had a lot to do
In a day or two
You were my dreams come true
Soul searching eyes
I visualize
A girl with heaven in her soul
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
A pickin' flowers drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew

A time or so
I felt you should be free
To wait for your
Prince charming to arrive
Then come the time
I know I can't survive
Without your heart beating 'neath my breath
If only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' the flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through

No other love
Could ever compensate
A heart of stone
My ever lasting fate
Alone at night
Tears cloud my dreams
But through the haze
Her image lasts
Ooh if only you were mine
We'd have a mellow time
Pickin' flowers and drinkin' wine
Rivers of love flowing through
Valleys of dew...
You're a diamond sparkling in the sand...
