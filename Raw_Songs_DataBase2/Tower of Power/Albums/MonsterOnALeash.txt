// Attitude Dance //

If you're feeling kinda shy
Don't even wanna try
Your dancin' can improve
With a little attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you're feeling kinda low
Don't even wanna go
Even if you change your mood
With a little attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Just cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

If you want to shake your hips
It don't have to be no trip
Break down and bust a move
But with an attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you want to throw a shake
Don't make a great escape
Adjust your point of view
Just add some attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Just cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

If you getting in the swing
You can really do your thing
And become the baddest dude
With the meanest attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

If you've got a certain style
Even if it's kinda wild
Most anything will do
With the proper attitude
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

Get a grip
Don't cop an attitude trip
Get a groove
You need some attitude
Move your feet
Go ahead and feel the beat
What you do is up to you
Once you begin to compete
In the attitude dance
In the attitude dance

What it gonna be like, when you begin
What it gonna be like, I'll be working like ten
What it gonna be like, when you take a chance
What it gonna be like, in the attitude dance
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

What it gonna be like, when you break the ice
What it gonna be like, gonna feel real nice
What it gonna be like, why don't you take a chance
What it gonna be like, in the attitude dance
And the attitude dance
And the attitude dance

// You Can't Fall Up (You Just Fall Down) //

You can be in love or be out of love
But never never ever fall in love
Because you can't fall up, you just fall down
And all you hear is that lonely sound
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

You can be in love or be out of love
But never ever slip and fall in love
Have you ever fallen and not been hurt
By the sudden impact when you crash to earth
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

You can be in love or be out of love
But never take a slip and fall in love
'Cause when you fall, you lose control
Reaching and grabbing for something to hold
You're going down, down, down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

('Cause you can't fall up)
You just fall down
(No you can't fall up)
You just fall down

// Funk The Dumb Stuff //

You think you're cold, to cold to behold
But the truth be told you're about to fold
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're hot, to hot to stop
But what you got, its about to flop
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)

(Funk the dumb stuff...)

You think you're bad, but ain't it sad
Realistically you can be had
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)
And you think you're good, as good as gold
But you're jive trip be getting old
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)

(Funk the dumb stuff...)

If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk you too
(Funk the dumb stuff)

You think you're hip, hip to the tip
But with all that lip, you're about to slip
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)
You think you're cool, too cool for school
But out of the pool, you're just a fool
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)

(Funk the dumb stuff...)

You think you're slick, so smooth and quick
On the real side, you're in a trip
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)
And you think you're bold, as bold as brass
But the truth be told we gonna kick yo
Funk the dumb stuff (funk the dumb stuff)

(Funk the dumb stuff...)

If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk with you
If you funk with me, I'll funk you too
(Funk the dumb stuff)

(Funk the dumb stuff...)

// Miss Trouble (Got A Lot Of Nerve) //

Trouble is, she's very fine
Trouble is, she's way out of line
Trouble is, she's very smart
Trouble is, she ain't got no heart
She wants her way, she wants her say
And if you play, she'll make you pay

And if you look to Miss Trouble
You'd best be gettin' gone
She's lookin' to strike you out
Correct me later if I'm wrong
If you're lookin' for the fast ball
She'll throw you a curve
She's always there for last call
Miss Trouble's got a lot of nerve

Trouble is, she's very likable
Trouble is, she's likely to go psycho on you
Trouble is, she's very devious
Trouble is, she's most mischievous
She's out to win, she'll do you in
She'll play you like a violin

Trouble is, she's very sneaky
Trouble is, she's four-star freaky
Trouble is, she's very live
Trouble is, she's all the way jive
She'll jack you up, and don't change the tire
She'll get you hot then put out the fire

// Keep Your Monster On A Leash //

(Say people!)

Some people's let their bodies on the ground
Let their monster do the talkin' all night long
Some people drink and drink till they pass out
Some people don't know what I'm talkin' about

It's very easy
His own to each
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
Yes you do

Some people paint their bodies black and blue
Let their monster get creative, yes they do
Some people like to spike their oily hair
Some people like to lose, they just don't care

Hear what I'm saying?
Just listen to the words I preach
You've got to keep your monster on a leash, yeah, yeah
You've got to keep your monster on a leash

(Listen!)

If you borrow
From tomorrow
Your future will be grim
If you really love your monster
You don't wanna have to do him in
Just keep your monster on a leash
Keep your monster on a leash

Some people almost die to go get live
Let their monster take control and take a dive
Some people spend their paychecks to get well
Some people can't relate, but what the hell

It's very simple
Stand up on your own two feet
You've got to keep your monster on a leash
You've got to keep your monster on a leash, yeah, yeah

If you borrow
From tomorrow
There's trouble on the way
So you better leash your monster
Or there's gonna be hell to pay
Just keep your monster on a leash
Keep your monster on a leash
(Haunt!)
Keep your monster on a leash
(Hit me!)

Take 'em on a walk
Some who might
On a leash
Oh, yeah!
Your monster on a leash

Oh, get a grip on your Godzilla
Go ahead, go ahead and hold hands with rodans
On a leash
Keep your monster on a leash
