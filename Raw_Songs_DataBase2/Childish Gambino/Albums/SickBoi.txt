Album: SickBoi

// Easy (Intro) //

[Childish Gambino]
Sick bois don't die, they fresh to death
My shoes bright blue so you watch my step
My hoodie hot pink with the hat to match
So you ain't gotta know where my paper at
Pop tags cause I'm filthy, (Apes) can (Bathe) me
My home is the dirty but I shine like crazy
My hat tag up, and it hang off slightly
My game (8-bit) so you niggaz can (byte) me
Nike like me cause my life is great
I'm married to the game, we should consummate
Brand new hoodies the color of light sabres
My name ain't Luke, but that dude date Leias
With fly ass sneakers, bump them speakers
Pump this groove until your ears start bleedin
White girls shake it 'til the black dudes notice
Black girls shake it so you can regain focus

[Chorus]
Swag it out, swag it out [8X]

[Childish Gambino]
Let's get one thing straight, I'm no average rapper
Born in So Cal, then I hit Atlanta
Then to New York, I'm an army brat
And I learned new things all across the map
In Cali I was small, taught me to be strong
And Atlanta had the hawk so I learned how to ball
New York had Starks on the New York Knicks
So when they came around I had my first round pick
And now I'm so sick that they call me ebola
Sick girls all on my pole like totem
Life is a gamble, your boy done told 'em
Play your cards right like it's Texas hold 'em
Bounce dem shoulders, go ahead Bankhead
I can do it better even though I'm Stone Mountain
Georgia's on my mind, but I live in New York
So I got a Southern drawl and I limp when I walk
They used to say a nigga lame when I started to rap
No them fake fuck niggaz askin me for a track
Pokin me on Facebook tryin to be my friend
Nigga you get your face took you ask me one mo' gen
I'm a genius, why they call the shit G-mail man
This is (MySpace) nigga, you can't make top ten
Hahaha... yo this how we do

[Chorus]

// Fire //

This that, fire!

It's your man Bambino, Sick Boi thriller
King of fly rappers, there ain't none iller
I'm into fly sneakers, colors like Gullies
So if you don't know me by now: "You's a dummy"
It's the Sick Boi anthem, girls take your coats off
Get the champagne, pop the cork like Sosa
Make some mimosas, get like me
Spanish girls holla say, "Aye papi"
Ooh la la, on the French Riviera
These other boys sandals, straight club benders
We some go-getters, you should know better
Your girl think 'bout me while she drivin' a Jetta
Used to blast Kelly Clarkson, now she a sick girl
Hot pink shirt and them lime green sneakers
Take a quick picture, put me on blast
Call the fireman, he need to come fast
I'm on fire

They call me Sick Boi cause they know I'm so sick
Purple on my starter cap, yellow on my kicks
Haters talkin' shit, they think they so slick
And if you don't like my style: "Eat a dick"
I'm a younger Denzel, say it ain't so
I'm all puffed up like I'm made of afros
But my neck ain't froze, where's the boy's jewelery?
Don't need it nigga, clothes bright, shine beautifully
Used to sport Airs then I had to get Grind
Now I look great, now I'm top of the line
Used to go hungry when I'd buy them new shoes
Now I'm like "Mm..food" like MF Doom
Busy makin' moves like my name was Tetris
Money in the bank, you can check my mattress
Bright like Mantis and I ain't selfish
I got the game shook like a young black Elvis
Fire

// I'm A Winner //

I'm a diamond in the rough
Everybody knows the score
Bambino on top
And them haters claymore
"But the people want more! "
And I'm a give it to 'em
I was born a winner,
All I had to do was show 'em,
My hoodie canary yellow
But I'm bright on my own
Most haters out there take naps like combs
I never sleep, I'm always on my grind,
I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme,
Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin',
They pissed off cause I'm more Eli than Peyton,
Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog,
I'm not a nigga who mows snow like Santa Claus,
I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls,
Cause I work from the bottom to the top,
I used to be lost like Lot,
Haters got a shook core like pop, get it?

[Chorus:]
Said the proof is in the pudding,
The secret's in the sauce,
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,
Said the proof is in the pudding,
The secret's in the sauce,
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,

I'm a winner (I'm a winner) [x8]

He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash (Oh oh, Oh oh)
Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last (Oh oh)
Better think fast, there's a pop quiz (Oh oh, Oh oh)
On which nigga get popped before his 25th (Oohh)
Y'all niggas need to learn to live, life is awesome,
Open up your own store, get a house in Boston,
I know it's not easy, it takes some drive,
Some niggas get desperate like the Housewives
And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy,
You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy,
You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere,
The world's made of Bruster's,
There's millions here,
But if you Richard Pryor, they having the cash you get,
And hard work and hoping and your faith is set,
I know the world's tough,
I was just like you,
I used to eat Lay's, now my chips are blue...

[Chorus:]
I said the proof is in the pudding,
The secret's in the sauce,
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,
Say the proof is in the pudding,
The secret's in the sauce,
I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss,

I'm a winner (I'm a winner) [x8]

Two step (Two step) [x4]
Now bounce it out (Bounce it out) [x4]
Fade (fade) [x4]
Walk it out (Walk it out) [x4]
Go 'head [x16]
Yea!

[Spoken:]

// Tru Dudes //

[Childish Gambino]
Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
That I stay rock hard like a meteorite
Thought your homeboy here was an idiot right?
Welllll you thought wrong, I got flavor
I rock shows with the blue light sabre
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves, blow up like Al'Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Your kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear clockers, pink highlighters
Haters wanna snack my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they're just like me
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?
Y'all standin in line, I'm in V.I.P.
Y'all know shit 'bout me like T.I.P., hah!

[Chorus]
[skatting and harmonizing]

[MC Chris]
You think your voice is funny man? That's kind of hilarious
I'm the rapper makin money when the shadow in your area
I'm like a damager cause I'm a little loquacious
I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious
I'm high pitched, might flip you diss my node
Think chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode
Kick your ass, sales not too early to boast
Seriously bro, hand over the security code
Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em
Fired all my lawyers cause I didn't wanna pay 'em
From the P.M. to the A.M. I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana
mc without Glover is Matubb without Wigs
Jammin peed the bottle with the grocer on her kids
If one smokes Khan, the other smokes Mids
Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
Smokin in the alley cause you know we're playin hookie
and we're up to no good, please don't tell our mommas
Democrist is the dutch, cause we got this for Obama

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
Sick of the Old Yeller, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a slick fella
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an umbrella
Come over to my place, we can cut like shears
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No - forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Your money so light that it float like pillows
Oopsy, killers, you can see
Cause they close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not
This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade
I'mma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard
And stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve
[four bars of silence]

[Chorus - to end]

// Red Alert //

Gin in my cup, so I ain't so sober
Girl on my dick, call me Casanova
Ribs are broken, my name is Oprah
My girl talk too but she deal in chocha
Got the gold top like I'm one of the Bradys
Birthday shit on the side, get that quick Mercedes
'Scuse me ladies! I know you wanna shoot me
like my name Jay Brady, but the cameras pay me
I wanna eat good like Rachel Ray
Pop tags on shoes on the 8th of May
My voice too high 'sposed to hold me back
They say the same fuckin thing cause I'm young and black
Opposites attract; so not far from me
is a white dude with low voice and no money
Who gives a fuck if my voice sound funny?
Fuck friends, I got me a bi-buddy
I'm (True Life) like I'm MTV
(Hollyhood) like I'm six times three
I been goin so crisp, get dressed in a fly ass t-shirt
Nike so tight they make your fuckin feet hurt
Jealous ass niggaz when they see you rollin
Same motherfucker on Ceezie scrotum
My sneaks so bright and my girls so thick
Money so big call me Ceezie Dick

[Chorus]
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a
Calling all haters all across the world it's a (red alert)
It's a (red alert), it's a

I shine so bright they should call me sunlight
Call me punk rock cause my jeans is too tight
Diesel boo boo, Michael jacket
Got one e'ry week, it's a nasty habit
Day eights and ups, that my standard
Show 'em who's boss like Tony Danza
Take it across state get the nasty plate
With my bootleg sex, why masturbate?
It's the dude from the hood that you love to hate
cause I got new shoes and I love to skate
Me and Lupe gotta (Kick) and (Push) it
Show these pussy-ass niggaz why we fuck they bush
I used to have to sweep floors just to make the ends meet
The ends meetin like a motherfucker - ain't that sweet?
Why I'm deep with the kids like Phish on myspace
Now I'm on your (Fishscales) like I hang with Ghostface
They say black don't crack, except for Whitney
My shit don't crack, I'm fallin off like Britney
To put it simply, I lose my balance
cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy
Live the high life, paid the full price
You want my advice to get the five mics?
You wanna put them fake-ass guns away
Nah I'm just kiddin nigga, you ain't got a chance anyway!

[Chorus - 2X]

// Love Is Crazy //

[Chorus]
We can go to Saturn, it doesn't really matter
We can get there, we can do it if you try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Childish Gambino]
Knock, knock, it's me
I'ma take ya fine ass out to Applebee's
Get anything you want, the shit is free - my friend work here
Whatcha mean, I ain't romantic?
I bought you flowers, so what they plastic?
We could fuck for hours, so what I'm nasty?
I ain't got the roommate, that was my old place
I'mma take you to the crib and show you the O face
You make me feel like I'm back in the 5th grade
Had a crush on Keana and she rocked the one braid
And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl's butt
You could get a girl pregnant, so look but don't touch
I like you so much, I know it sound crazy
But I'd have a sex change just so I could have your baby
Ooooh! The roles are reversed
So you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse
A nigga so sick, that my car's a doctor
Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor
Kick it in Chinese like you're Shaolin soccer
Got nothin' but dinero, so you meetin the Fockers
Look at my clock-ers, it's time to roll out
Get sneaks, sneaks and sneaks, and they sold out
That's what I'm all about and if you got the time
It's hard to make change when you want one dime

[Chorus]

[Eugene Cordero]
Welcome back everyone to 'The Noise in Space'
Got a new constellation for you to trace
Use the far East star for your startin place
You see it? My big dipper slappin you in the face
Step out of the shed, let the sun be felt
on your head as you undo Orion's Belt
Oh nuts! I just crashed landed
on the planet of the gay cli-ché
Talkin Milky Way, bouquets
Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bu-blé
Sorry if I caught you off-guard
with my five second de-lay
But the jet-lag's making me loopy
and my sales are soupy
Soupy Sales!
I eat chocolate!

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[repeat 3X]
I love you baby (I love you baby) [3X]
I love you baby

[Outro]
I love you baby [2X]

// My Hoodie //

My names Bambino, I'm always in trouble
I do studpid shit on a dare like double
Thinking your games tight, I'm gonna bust your bubble
I shop at Gucci and Barneys like rubble
Scope like Hubble, quick like tunnel
I leave MC's in the dark light tunnel
Men do huddles, girlfriends cuddle
Eh heh, alright

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow

My hoodie is so dope, my hoodie is so tight
My hoodie is in school cause my hoodie is so bright
Welcome my nigga to the color crayola
Got the birght purple, like a grape soda
Nigga I told you, my hoodie no joker
Walk up in the hoodie to a party like toga
Breathe like yoga, Get off my scrotum
The color of my hoodie like a Lisa Frank folder
I'm at the kid robot, my wallet done sho nuf
They had five hoodies but this shit done sold out
Spent too much, I know a bad habit
My hoodie looks like a shit from a tricks rabbit

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow

Ya'll know I'm a hoodie all pro
Find me in my hoodie like a hoodie waldo
Rocking Amadeus like a hoodie falco
Staying self absorbed like I'm Frida Kahlo
From the playground, with the sports team on it
To the old folks home, put some morphine on it
I rock my hoodie whether it's rain or shine
Over-priced, in a Sam Goody frame of mind
Got a pouch in the front that holds my CDs
And warms my hands when it's too breezy
Believe me, the quickest way to get hurt
Is if I catch you calling it a hooded sweatshirt

My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow
My hoddie, my my my hoodie on glow

// Fresh //

[Intro]
Go [8X]
Well wait a minute!
Go [8X]
Wait a minute!
Go [4X]
I'm so fresh!
Go [4X]
Wait a minute! [echoes]

Starter cap bro, gone with the hologram
I be the rich folk's hoe like a Ottoman
I got weed in my hand like a homey can
A throwback like a bitch throw Radaman
I'm fire! All I need is the breaks though
I make noise in the streets like a brake toe
But that's high, so I'm gettin my fade low
I make movies with my lover like J-Lo
I'm livin so shiny, ya boy on top
A life on trap, a nigga can't stop
I'm Weird like Al, I'm Strange like Love
I wear hot pink cause it fit like glove
I'm easy on the eyes; I'm hard on a hater
My hoodie light saber, like Darth Vader
I'm always with a chick cause a nigga so sick
Need an (Entourage) quick so you can hug it out bitch

[Chorus: repeat with ad libs]
I'm so fresh! {oh yeah, oh oh}

I'm so fresh like a (Sick Boi) oughta be
I'm not tryin that shit, just a part of me
I'm easy, like a Sunday morning
I go to rap battles and I end up yawning
I'm fresh like TexMex in Arizona
Got my gold on forever like my name Ramona
I can't be a loser, the shit don't suit me
A nigga Joe Cool and you niggaz just Snoopy!
You can go sue me, try to do outdo me
I look so fresh that I killed George Clooney
I guess you can call me (The Perfect Storm)
I'm the reason why your new baby brother was born
A nigga so tore call me Natalie
Cause I love makin music but they mad at me
I make money, blow shows like a syndicate
Out to be who I gotta be, that's the end of it!

[Chorus]

// Till I Die //

S-I-C-K B-O-I
You should come join us, nigga we so fly
Highlighter colors, brand new sneaks
Sick Bois stick together in a pinch like cheeks
We the new lost boys - I'm Peter Pan
cause I bring the bright green Tinkerbell in my hand
We can run (House Parties) - my name ain't Play
but youse a Kid, you should be on your way
Cut this like barkers, hoodies like Parkers
Haters on my dick, take a bite like sharkers
I'ma stay weirdo, I'm a straight hero
Haters want me stop makin numbers like zero
I'ma get flyer, numbers get higher
You would stop movin, like a black tire
I'm not (The Wire) but I'm like Michael
Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire

[Chorus]
We the Sick Boi clique [8X]
Sick Boi 'til I die [8X]

I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not
I'm crazy like a swastika, inside of a bagel shop
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch! Unstoppable
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin like a bored scratch
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubador
Face it, only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'ma try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!
I'ma try to modify the subject like a predicate
I'm not the best rapper but I'm better than you
You with a big pickle like your name was Stu
I'm a Sick Boi, that's just how we do
Even your name's a game like you DJ Clue

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sick Boi 'til I die [16X]

// So Sick Wit It //

[Intro]
Uhh
Yeah! This how we do this
(Sick Boi)
Gonna show y'all how I does
Childish, Gambino
Gambino, on the real
Let's do it

Girl show your wobble off
I'm not Queen Latifah but I (Set It Off)
I'm lookin like a tight rainbow, Kangols, got my blue ruse
Lookin like candy so I'm goody two-shoes
Call me (Spruce Goose) cause my clothes so fly
I'm not Howard Hughes, but I'm not a sane guy
I'm a (Big Mac), you just a small fry
Tryin so hard to get that swagger like mine
And got them steps off my head, I guess my mind wanders
Try to emulate my (Lifestyle) like condoms
I'm fly on the mic, I'm fly as a DJ
I keep a thick chick on (The Wire) like (Wee-Bey)
He say, she say that I so handsome
And Flay keep away from this girl like Ransom
Sorry that your girl all Europe like Tyler
You know him from the South, I stay dirty like Tyler

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
So sick with it that they call me ebola

My boombox handy, blastin that stank
You can Marcus like Quimby, they call me the Tank
Cause nobody can touch me, I'm fire with a fade
I ate a La-Z-Boy but I'm always gettin laid
I'm jack of all trades, I can do no wrong
I'm make a huge fart and it style like a song
I talk jibber jabber and it comes out words
I shit out cavities, you flossin my turds
I don't like ice; a little bit of gold and them Nikes
The Cool Kids understand my plight
I'm a simple Sam - I'm always thick with it
cause that's who I am - I keep that shit slick
like my name was Pam - and even if I did it
I'd be the flyest nigga drivin 'round in a Civic
And for those who didn't get it, you should play it back
I'm sick like a dog on crack, f'real

[Chorus]

// Assassins //

[DC Pierson]
MapQuest where the place is, gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins, replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swoll
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK's head just a big smoky hole
to console Jackie O she could, smoke my pole
It's called Camelot cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I'm the (King of Queens), Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job cause I can't let a day go
Tomorrow's moguls, are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her kegels
Cause when we take the game we won't leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horsehead in your bed, now you know who you sleepin on
(Are you seeing what I'm seeing?) This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is

[Chorus 2X: Childish Gambino]
True assassins, hold your glass up
Thems the type of niggaz that'll cut your ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses, chains or purses
Them the type of niggaz that'll make you stop

[Nick Packard]
Classic assassin, straight from Central Casting
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
I'm never gonna die like I'm Tuck Everlasting
Never thought that I'd carry an AK
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey
And maybe someday that dream will come true
But for now I got my gun and I'm aimin at you (hey!)
In your house on your couch while you're readin
I got no flow, it's more like breakthrough bleedin
But I'm into cartoons and I'm really not sane
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain (ugh!)
I'm more Manson than a small-time crook
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook
Bitch, take a look, you know it's in a book
Even LeVar Burton's roots get shook

[Childish Gambino]
Ah you can call me assassin, I kill Versace
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it's all matchin
I kill rappers, I don't need no stealin
If I do lose a battle I'ma kill 'em for real
I'm just kidding, or am I?
Things get real in the City, of L.I.
That's right I live in Queens, the borough of the lost
I hate the fuckin yuppies but I love how much it costs
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis
And they give me strange looks cause I floss like a dentist
I'ma finish this sentence then get me a rope
So I got a little dough and I'm fresh like Scope
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas
that never take a bath so I call 'em homeschoolers
Numbers like rulers, I'm tired of it all
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball
I'm off the hook like phone calls, where's Kid Robot?
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers
I'm not Mekhi Phifer, but I got +Clockers+
Transform a watch when I don't got diamonds
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?
I kill boutiques, just snatch the new sneak
I'mma do it every week, I'm a serial killer
Beats like Dilla, hun like 'tilla
It's the Sick Boi thrilla (yeah, mon!)

[Chorus]

// Baby Doll //

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You're my babydoll, I'll hold you closer
I'll hold you closer, just like I'm supposed to
Know I got what you need [4X]

I'm a weird dude, but you like me
Give other girls shocks like Nikes
I know I'm always on the road, you can type me
And if you don't do that, you can Skype me
I'm a big kid, and you know that
But it don't make me happy so we blow dat
Can I make time? I don't really know
Cause you seem pissed off when I go to shows
I never really had a girl like dis
But I ain't never had a girl who could keep interest
The things that I do, the things that I wanna be
I know I'm hardheaded, can't see things in front of me
I'm gonna be the best, you can believe that
So try an understand when I have to leave that
When I'm done, I'ma give you the call
Don't you know sugar, you my sugar babydoll

[Chorus]

I love you both, can't you tell?
I love her lights, I love the smell
But I think you kinda know I got a girl on the side
She pay for my house and she pay for my ride
She give me nice things and she make me feel good
She give me a little cash and I spend it on you
She my sugar momma, only with her for the money
But you know it's untrue cause I talk about her funny
Saturday nights, I'm supposed to be with you
But instead I'm in bed with the stage and the crew
She laughs at my jokes, she tell me I'm cute
She tells me if we together we make a little loot
But I know I couldn't have her if I didn't have you
And I know sometimes I don't make curfew
You know I'd never ever ever try to hurt you
I'm a just try to do what I gotta do

[Chorus]
