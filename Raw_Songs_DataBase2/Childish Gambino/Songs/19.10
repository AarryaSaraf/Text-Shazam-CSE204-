Ooh
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Let me tell you something true

I remember, uh, back when I was six years old, uh
Daddy said, "The world's so cold"
"There is something that you should know"
Uh
"You're so gorgeous," thanks, daddy
"Nothing's really worth your time"
"But someday soon you just might find"
"The truth about the world's design," oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know that, yeah

Now remember, uh
You do what the hell you want, uh
But someone's gonna sell your funk
You're exactly what they want (Truth)
To be happy really means that someone else ain't
And balance ain't the one who claim
Everything is give and take, oh, oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know

Don't do it like this, okay (Woo)
Jump ship (Yeah, oh no)
Do a ditty now (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
Ayy, ayy, uh (Ooh)

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no
To be beautiful is to be hunted (I can't, I know)
I can't change the truth (I said), I can't get you used to this
Ooh, give it to me now, bring the strings back, uh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
We are beautiful, yeah
Stay so beautiful
That's so beautiful
