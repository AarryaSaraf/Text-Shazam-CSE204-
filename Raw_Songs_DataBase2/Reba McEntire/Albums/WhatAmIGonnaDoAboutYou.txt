Album: WhatAmIGonnaDoAboutYou

// Why Not Tonight //

Well pardon me but you have my attention

Ever since you strolled into the room

Believe me that it's not my intention

If I appear to come on too smooth


It's not like me to make such advances

But this time baby I could not resist

So if you're up for taking a chance on love

I can't see a better time than this


So baby why not tonight

This could be the start of something right

Hey you can take it easy

We can take it so slow

We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go

So baby why not tonight

The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree

Oh it's a perfect night for falling in love

So why not fall in love with me


Oh maybe we could go out for some dinner

And later on how we could do the town

Ya know I consider myself a winner

Just to have a boy like you around


Then if you're up for doing some dancing

Yeah I know a place they dance until the dawn

Anything you like will be alright

So why not take a chance and come along


So baby why not tonight

This could be the start of something right

Hey you can take it easy

We can take it so slow

We can take it anywhere that you'd like to go

So baby why not tonight

The stars are out and I'm sure they'll agree

Oh it's a perfect night for falling in love

So why not fall in love with me

Why not fall in love, why not fall in love, baby why not fall in love with me

// What Am I Gonna Do About You //

The kid down the street mowes the grass every week

The neighbor next door fixed the roof where it leaked

Job's going fine and the bills are all paid

And everyone thinks that I'm doing OK


There's a guy down at work

He's asked me out once or twice

I haven't said yes

But I'm thinking I might

And on my way home I thought I saw you walk by

If only I could get you out of my mind


What in the world am I gonna do about you

Oh your memory keeps coming back

From out of the blue

Oh well I try

And I try

But I still can't believe that we're through

So tell me what in the world am I gonna do about you

What am I gonna do about you


I went to the store

But it wasn't much fun

It doesn't take long when you're shopping for one

Standing in line I thought I saw you walk in

And that's when it started all over again


What in the world am I gonna do about you

Oh your memory keeps coming back

From out of the blue

Oh well I try

And I try

But I still can't believe that we're through

So tell me what in the world am I gonna do about you

What am I gonna do about you

Darling what am I gonna do about you

// Lookin' For A New Love Story //

All my life I've looked at love as a fairy tale

A woman a man never never land and a storybook ending

Leading roles and my heros upon the silver screen

I played em all but always came up empty

But one of these days I'll be in a movie with 'em


Cause I believe that fantasy

Is one step from reality

For those of us who dream of love

And I believe cause I want to

There's some one man for someone who believes in love

To not give up

Even though you've heard so many say

That's the way the story goes


I'm lookin for a new love story

I'm lookin for a yellow brick road

That'll carry me to his door

I'm lookin for a new love story

Oh one that's never been told before


And I have searched the oceans of many a man's eyes

But I have yet to feel like more than some deserted island

I know a relationship will come for me in time

And I can't wait to see his face on my horizon

Cause one of these days he'll sail into my life


Cause I believe that fantasy

Is one step from reality

For those of us who dream of love

And I believe cause I want to

There's some one man for someone who believes in love

To not give up

Even though you've heard so many say

That's the way the story goes


I'm lookin for a new love story

I'm lookin for a yellow brick road

That'll carry me to his door

I'm lookin for a new love story

Oh one that's never been told before

// Take Me Back //

Now and then I open up a trunk full of old souvenirs

Thumb through a scrapbook holding back the tears

I keep wishing we could do it once more

Just the way we did before


Take me back to Sycamore Park

Put the radio dial on the golden oldies

Hey lay a blanket down and hold me

We can stay all night

By the light of the moon above

So take me back, back to love


Ever since you took me to the big city

Looking for the start

Living in the fast lane

Is tearing us apart

Sometimes don't you want to trade it all in

For a little way back when


Take me back to Sycamore Park

Put the radio dial on the golden oldies

Hey lay a blanket down and hold me

We can stay all night

By the light of the moon above

So take me back, back to love


Well I remember sneaking out the back

Mama thought I was asleep

Watching for your headlights

Creeping down the street

Trying to steal a kiss

Just anyway we can

Back where it all began


Take me back to Sycamore Park

Put the radio dial on the golden oldies

Hey lay a blanket down and hold me

We can stay all night

By the light of the moon above

So take me back, back to love


Take me back to Sycamore Park

Put the radio dial on the golden oldies

Hey lay a blanket down and hold me

We can stay all night

By the light of the moon above

So take me back, back to love

// My Mind Is On You //

We had a fight

A lover's quarrel

Angry words spoken in haste

Deep in the night

It went out of control

And with tears streaming down my face

I slammed the door and I walked out

Swearing that we were through

Now I'm sitting in a bar

Thinking I've gone too far

Wondering what I'm gonna do

Thinking about calling you


To my left blue collar

To my right a high dollar man

Across the bar a smooth bartender

Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand

Well they buy me drinks

Light my cigarette

They're all wondering which one I'm gonna choose

Oh my hand's on my glass

My second margarita

And my mind is on you

My mind is on you


Well I ran away

In a moment of weakness

I couldn't hold my own

I should stay

Because being together

Means more than who was right or wrong

And sitting in a room full of lonely faces

You're the only one I see

If you only knew

I was thinking of you

Would you come and rescue me

Maybe I should call and see


To my left blue collar

To my right a high dollar man

Across the bar a smooth bartender

Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand

Well they buy me drinks

Light my cigarette

They're all wondering which one I'm gonna choose

Oh my hand's on my glass

My second margarita

And my mind is on you

My mind is on you

My third margarita


I should of known I could never get along

Outside of your love

It's last call

And I'm out of cigarettes

They are all wondering what I'm gonna do

Oh my hand's on the glass

It's my last margarita

And my mind is on you

My mind is on you

My mind is on you

// Let The Music Lift You Up //

Well you say you're from the city

Chicago is your home

Hey I'm a country girl

Over Oklahoma way

Oh there are miles and miles between us

But that don't mean a thing

When those guitars start to play


Oh sweet sounds of freedom

Ringing through the air

Sending out a message to us all

We don't have a curtain

Made of iron or stone

We are not divided by a wall


So come on tell me

Hey, hey, hey

From L.A. to Broadway

Hey, hey, hey

Let the music lift you up

Hey, hey, hey,

Whoa everybody's singin'

Hey, hey, hey,

Let the music lift you up


When you're feelin' low

Hit that radio

Let the music lift you

Let the music lift you

Up, way up, way up


There are books that tell us

What makes this whole world turn

And how heaven holds the star wars

But there's no explanation

Lord it's still a mystery

How a song can touch your heart


So come on tell me

Hey, hey, hey

From L.A. to Broadway

Hey, hey, hey

Let the music lift you up

Hey, hey, hey,

Whoa everybody's singin'

Hey, hey, hey,

Let the music lift you up


Let the music lift you

Let the music lift you

Up, way up, way up

// I Heard Her Cryin' //

The whole night in the kitchen

Saying words we'll both regret

And you scream you we're leaving

And you cursed the day we met


The sound goes above the slamming door

And broken dishes thrown around the floor

So loud it made us stop

It was the sound of a teardrop


When I heard her crying

Thought she was tucked away in bed

I heard her crying

Wish we could take back what we said

I didn't think she was old enough to know

Oh Lord we must have hurt her so

When she begged you not to go

I heard her crying


Well I'd have given anything

For time to erase

When I turned around and saw

Those little tears roll down her face


Oh my heart nearly broke in two

When she said

Mommy what did I do

To make you and daddy mad

Oh I'm sorry I was bad


I looked at you and you looked at me

And we felt each other's shame

Kneeling down to hold our child

Said she was not to blame

Now sometimes when we're angry

And say things that aren't true

We still love each other

And baby we love you


When I heard her crying

Thought she was tucked away in bed

I heard her crying

Wish we could take back what we said

I didn't think she was old enough to know

Oh Lord we must have hurt her so

When she begged you not to go

I heard her crying

// No Such Thing //

Well there's news flying 'round

On the rosy side of town

That I have gone and found somebody new

Well ?

Against the way some people talk

I guess sometimes it's all they have to do


Oh there ain't no such thing

As me not loving you

Honey there ain't no such thing

As me not being true

So believe your heart and not your ears

Your heart knows what is true

There's no such thing

As me not loving you


Well a love like yours and mine

Has got to deal with the jealous kind

But I don't mind there's nothing I can do

Cause their words can do no harm

With you here in my arms

So they can talk until their talk turn blue


Oh there ain't no such thing

As me not loving you

Honey there ain't no such thing

As me not being true

So believe your heart and not your ears

Your heart knows what is true

There's no such thing

As me not loving you

There ain't no such thing as me not loving you

// One Promise Too Late //

I would have waited forever

If I'd known that you'd be here

We could have shared our lives together

And held each other close all through the years

But I've met someone before you

And my heart just couldn't wait

So no matter how much I adore you

I've got to stand behind the promise that I made


Where were you

When I could have loved you

Where were you

When I gave my heart away

All my life I've been dreaming of you

You came along one promise too late

You came along one promise too late


I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you

I can't have you but I never will forget you


Where were you

When I could have loved you

Where were you

When I gave my heart away

All my life I've been dreaming of you

You came along one promise too late

You came along one promise too late


Where were you

When I could have loved you

Where were you

When I gave my heart away

All my life I've been dreaming of you

You came along one promise too late

You came along one promise too late

// Till It Snows In Mexico //

Riding up in Oklahoma

People call us blind

'Cause we believe in God and love

And old fashioned things

We still draw the line between wrong and right

And when a woman takes a husband it's for life


We met on a road from Tulsa

Travelers in the night

Well I knew we belong together

It just felt so right

There's something about this gal you ought to know

She's gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico


I'm gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico

Or till the Rio Grande freezes over

Cause darling when God made our love

He threw away the mold

And I'm gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico


If you should ever leave me

Heaven forbid

But you don't have to worry none

About me ?

You know exactly where I'll go

I'll be waiting for the snow in Mexico


I'm gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico

Or till the Rio Grande freezes over

Cause darling when God made our love

He threw away the mold

And I'm gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico


Cause darling when He made our love

He threw away the mold

I'm gonna love you

Till it snows in Mexico
