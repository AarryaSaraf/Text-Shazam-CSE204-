Stretching, filing against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin we breathe, in sex we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky

Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gathering dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor

Custard dreams
Abusing, using
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I

Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs for great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover

If today I die and can't deny
The poison chosen for tonight
Tonight

Borrowed dreams, hollowed reveries
Metal pillows, pewter yellows
Furry roadkill, house on the hill
Pouring gravy on her thighs still

If today I die and can't deny
The poison chosen for tonight
Tonight
