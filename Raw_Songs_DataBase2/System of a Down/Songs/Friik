What's my problem
Here's my problem
My problem is I'm
Too visual to be blind
Too audiological to deaf
Too ideological to be in peace
Too compassionate to be in war
Too crazy to be sane
Too sane to be lazy
Too emotional to be you

If I could only stop my head from going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back to my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams, transparent mountains of our own reality

Burning oceans
Melting faces 
Melting faces
Why?

Burning oceans
Melting faces
Melting Faces
Why?
Lying glaciers 
Swimming meadows
Mind control

Amnesia!
Hysteria!
Insomnia!
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't shit
Cause you're in the hospital and they're fucking
Why?

Burning oceans
Melting faces

Mind control
Maybe my mind's not a t all in control
Maybe I'm not in control
