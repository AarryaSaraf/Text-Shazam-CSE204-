We never summoned the devil
We never hide from the devil

Terrorists we're fighting and we're never gonna stop
The prostitutes who prosecute have failed us from the start

Persecution ends now

Guess who's coming over to dinner
The genocidal humanoidz
Teaching warfare to their children
The bastards that will be destroyed
Guess who's coming over to dinner
The genocidal humanoidz
