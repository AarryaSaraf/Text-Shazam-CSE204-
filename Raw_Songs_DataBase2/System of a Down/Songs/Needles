I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains
And the walking of the canes
When you do come out
And you whisper up to me
In your life of tragedy

But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me
Oh when will I be free
And you, a parasite
Just find another host
Just another fool to roast

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

I cannot deny
All the evil traits
And the filling of the crates
When you you do come out out
And you slither up to me
In your pimping majesty

But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me
Oh when will I be free
And you you, a parasite parasite
Just find another host
Just another stool to post

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of me

I'm sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying man

Sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying man

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey
