// Blue Bell Knoll //

Each is not my love, moan I for what
I make up hundreds so I know how to make love
There, you can have my youth, I know I have loved
Started to see him, 'till when I married him

To yearn admits you're outside to me
Grow up

I have seen these all my life, perhaps a lot more
And I have been so naive
All move and try he knew not
And your spangle, how it hurts, and I have feelings

To yearn admits you're outside to me
Grow up

To yearn admits you're outside to me
Grow up

// Athol-Brose //

Try to walk slow (try to walk slow) 
Let it pain (let it pain) 
Jelly ball (jelly ball) 
Shouldn't fade (shouldn't fade) 
Let us drown (let us drown) 
Long down (long down) 
He bought me (he bought me) 
Content 

Very very silly ball 
Very very silly boy 

Try to walk slow (try to walk slow) 
Let it pain (let it pain) 
Jelly ball (jelly ball) 
Shouldn't fade (shouldn't fade) 
Let us drown (let us drown) 
Long down (long down) 
He bought me (he bought me) 
Content 

Very very silly ball 
Very very silly boy 

Now I see 
Next day 
Yeah 

Your heart shall not be safe from me 
God's light, shine on me 
Your heart shall not be safe from me 
Flow down light, shine on me 

Very very silly ball 
Very very silly boy

// Carolyn's Fingers //

When he said, 'You are full of love'
She fell down into this dirty mess
Some people see me laugh and tell us, 
'It's wrong to make fun of me' 

(Even they don't give any more)
(Try, try to fall)
She fell down into this mess
(Even then they don't give)
(Try, try to fall)
She fell down and he's so sick of it all
And of me

This part not out of her saw fit to drop
Whispers might prove it all
(You're just closer to me when you fall, but you broke)
This would prove it all
(You just closer to me, but you broke)
This would prove it all
Sleep now
You susur, try to talk
Reach out for that hand

Reach out for that hand
(And even they don't give any more)
(Try, try to fall)
Even then they don't give
(Try, try to fall)
You just closer to me at the fall
But you don't want, want me hand
You're just closer to me
But you don't want, want my hand

// For Phoebe Still A Baby //

Little Phoebe
Who I've never seen
Had you asked, I'd be right out
And maybe
In a good time
Phoebe, then I'll tuck you in

How is it
(Listen angel)
You do
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, angel)
Don't tell
(Please smile on, angel)
Run along and shine the whole night away

And, say
And maybe
In a good time
Phoebe then I'll tuck you in
Little Phoebe
Who I've never seen
Had you asked, I'd be right out

For love feels
(Listen angel)
Feels
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, now, angel)
It's all the same
(Listen, now, angel)
Run along and shine the whole world, angel
How is it
(Listen angel)
You do
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, angel)
Don't tell
(Please smile on, angel)
Run and shine the whole world now, my angel

// The Itchy Glowbo Blow //

Still stepping over me
Little, he needs
(Didn't he? How hadn't he?)
Little, you may need

And you know how sometimes
When your face gives right in to him
You've chosen your life for your man, yea
And look at your goals
Standing at his feet
(Didn't he? How hadn't he?)
Sometimes he flailed

But you're glad he cares
But you're glad he

And you died sometimes
When your face gives right in to him
You've chosen your life for your man, yea
For him? For yourself?
Futile, in love
(Didn't he? How hadn't he?)
Futile is this fever

And you died 
Did I see dark lines?
So, what have you got now?
Futile, in love
(Didn't he? How hadn't he?)
Futile is this fever

The spirit of life fires me now
The spirit of life fires me now
The spirit of life fires me now
The spirit of life fires me

// Cico Buff //

Today love finds off little
You see your singing is so vague
His joined her love so little
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find

So many stars take care of me
Take care of those they love
My love has done right

Love me so, love little
So you see now the sun is out
Love will accieve no ends
I can't be fickle, oh that I find

So many stars take care of me
Take care of those they love
Our love has done right
They know where they like it
All of love flow 'round of me
Strain and love me

Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find
Don't care if you're fickle, oh that I find

They know whether I come
(We flow and we fall)
I love for mine
(We fall down)
Strain and love me
(These stars that love)
So many stars take care of me
(We flow and we flow)
All of love flow 'round me
(Our love comes down)
Our love comes down
(These stars I love)
They know whether I come
(We flow and we fall)
Full of love fall down
(Our love comes down)
Strain and love me

// Spooning Good Singing Gum //

Days, nervous, long by the sea
Long love found of long by the dove

Love, love, happy
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Love, love, happy

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Love, love, happy
Cute couple

Simply cought up
Simply cought up

Happy and then
Happy and then

Simply cought up
Simply cought up

Happy and then
Happy and then

// A Kissed Out Red Floatboat //

I said, 
I said 'I love you, yes, now"
Maybe love will hear him say
I thought he'd known loving before
He's so mean to her
If only had he held on
He'd be along side with you so guarded

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care
He really don't care

I've been here
Here with more than he asked from her
And I have got what you needed for your heart
He gave me love
He hit me
He loved you, you know

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care
He really don't care

He really don't care
He hardly there
He really don't care

// Ella Megablast Burls Forever //

Men don't tell much
Through the heart and breast
Men don't have that much
Through the heart and breast

Men don't have much
Felt it from the heart again
(For those who accieve this grace)
Don't hold that against me
Felt it from the heart again
(For those who accieve this grace)

Mistakes
Whisked away
Away and
Be joyful and joyful
(Be joyful and joyful)
Mistakes
Whisked away
Away and
Be joyful and joyful
With all the feelings on the ground

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in
