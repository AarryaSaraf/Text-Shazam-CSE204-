Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

And I knew deeper darlin
Idiom a deus is dos
Indeared look he loves it
Your elan new sub dearie

Says your supper should shout
As you eat up seisured
Evil oh it will 
Evolve evil vamos a la

Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

He tear them off, he tear them off 
He tear them off and eat the meal too
Oh eat off your toe
As you eat up
Slow eat that meal, slow eat that meal
Slow eat that meal, no way down
No way down, you're close
Chew too slow, you're close
And how can you mock me
How can you be in the nude
When you're my friend
When you're my friend
He tear them off, he tear them off
ik does
Oh eat off your toe

I know I need to tell you
All I've seen, all i catch
Put in the poster girl
And shake like dogs of tiding scholar

Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

He tear them off, he tear them off 
He tear them off and eat the meal too
Oh eat off your toe
As you eat up
Slow eat that meal, slow eat that meal
Slow eat that meal, no way down
No way down, you're close
Chew too slow, you're close
And how can you mock me
How can you be in the nude
When you're my friend
When you're my friend
He tear them off, he tear them off
Ik does
Oh eat off your toe

// Serpentskirt //

Suppose I should hate it so
Yet I can smell saliva
Palamino set afloat
Yet I can smell saliva
Hides it very well
As a baby

Has a playmate
Yeah baby
Yeah guess it's blown
Hides it very well 
As a baby

Telling me words in Turkish
Your nosiness, your belly
Frantically or mimicly
Your nosiness, your belly
Has your mother gone 
as a baby as a baby

Has a playmate
We are helpless as babies
As a baby 
As a baby
Hides it very well
As a baby 

Has a playmate
Has your mother gone
Reach out your hand 
He seldom will
And a memory

Go out
He seldom will
Go out 
He seldom will

Smart you should heal soon
An eagle spares your bedroom
Palominoes as we flow
An eagle spares your bedroom
Some forget where to go
They know fear again

// Tishbite //

I'm at a loss
I don't know what to do 
Feel like a waterless Nile
Come here just hold me
To feel safe enough to some
Daring to senses sure
A fable look what happens when
I don't risk losing you
There's no guarantee
How are we to know if the response is coming
I'm in the wrong place
Is it like a, is it like a
Is it like a dream
How does it, how does it seem grounded and real
(deep background voice)Seem very untrue
Is it like a, Is it like a, is it like a dream
How does it, how does it seem grounded and real
(deep background voicee)Seem very untrue
I feel a connection, a deep connection
But it's not reflected
In time spent together
It's reflected cycle
Clear imaginary
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(this mountain of pleasure)
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(oh oh I want to get lost in it)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
(sleeping like a baby)
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(stay close, stay close)
Is it like a, is it like a, is it like a dream
How does it, how does it, seem grounded and real
(oh until I don't know where you end and, I begin
Until I just, carry it in me carry it in me carry it in me
I wanna get lost)

// Half-Gifts //

It's an old game, my love
When you can't have me, you want me
Because you know that you're not risking anything

Intimacy is when we're in the same place 
At the same time
Dealing honestly with how we feel, 
And who we really are

That's what grown-ups do
That is mature thinking

Well I'm still a junkie for it
It takes me out of my aloneness
But this relationship cannot sustain itself

Intimacy is when we're in the same place 
At the same time
Dealing honestly with how we feel, 
And who we really are

That's what grown-ups do
That is mature thinking

I just have to know how to be in the process
Of creating things in a better way
And it hurts but it's a lie that I can't handle it
I still have a world of me-ness to fulfill
I still have a life, and it's a rich one even with mourning
Even with grief and sadness

I still care about this planet
I am still connected to nature 
And to my dreams for myself

I have my friends, my family.
I have myself
I still have me

I have my friends, my family.
I have myself
I still have me

// Calfskin Smack //

I have to follow my heart
Life, it, it just seems right, now

And when I had you
I didn't always want you, baby
I'd cry myself out
But you survived and this amased me

Stiv, stiv, God made it claw
(Even into)
Call, call, calling to yourself
(Calling to find)
Then find anger's a part of me
(Anger's a cannibal)
You won, you'se flawless, little fell

// Rilkean Heart //

Rilkean heart I looked for you
To give me transcendent experiences
To transport me out of self and aloneness
And alienation into a sense of
One-ness and connection ecstatic and magical

I became a junkie for it
I came looking for the next high
And I'm sorry

I've been putting the search on the wrong place
I understand that you're confused
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality, with cleaning up my emotion of life

And I'm getting in touch with myself
I'm beginning to ground myself
In my own sense of being as an entity
One entity on the planet

Becoming truly self-reliant and become connected
With something beyond me
That is where I have to go
I'm so sorry 

I've been putting the search on the wrong place
You're lost and don't know what to do
But that's not all of you
That's your reality today
And that is all okay

I understand that you're confused, 
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality

You're lost and don't know what to do
But it's not all of you
That's the reality today
And now it's all okay

I understand that you're confused, 
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality

Rilkean heart......

// Ups //

Shed our cold reality

We are low we are low 
We are ups
We

Look up and see angels see

Now see inside me
Sheer and spooky
Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share
Yes you know

Get up all we had to now
We are low we are low
We are ups
We

Look up and now angel see
You have seen inside me
sheer and spooky

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to
Blessed my summering this way

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

Never lose contact
Makes our life show up, show up
This place I have inside me I will learn to share

To realize you are a liar

// Eperdu //

Above day 
Holding nest
Both that sheltering 

And taking posession hand
Outstretched, 
Trembles its echo

Above day 
Holding nest
Both that sheltering 

And taking posession hand
Outstretched, 
Trembles its echo

// Treasure Hiding //

You listen hard
Fear of flying
Fear of flying
With our love

Now I am sure
You and I will(the lips, the heart)
And you and I yeah
Illuminated

The lips, the heart
Illuminated
Fear of flying(the lips, the heart)
Fear of flying
Fear of flying(the heart, the soul, 
illuminated, illuminated)

The lips the heart
The heart the soul
illuminated

Heart-shaped chews and traps
Treasure hiding
Scared of temptress skill
Love I'd sold, I was trying
Deep without us 
Down down and further- tears
Collective in try and stop
Fire is out
Not ready focus
Life places scars
Purify them
Constancy
Purifies new skins
In excelcius
Glee she'll use as fire
Lips spread the fire
Your heart
And you are ready

The lips, the heart
You're the fire, you're the flame
The heart, the soul
Hand in hand, hand in hand

// Seekers Who Are Lovers //

Brush by gracefully
A love as big as a risk
Fills you up
And you can't look on

The breath of god in my mouth
A love you can taste
God get some paste
He and I, breath to breath

Clothed in saliva
Healing thru your arm
I cant stop hungering for otherness.

I forgot the use
My head fall out the sky
And crashed into my palms
Jesus God valentine

Love 
On the tip of it
The old rivers lack of other sweet scents
So sweet
You are a woman just as you are a man

Creeping on the Gas
Is a magic love, like,
Like a Flights, clouded peak
I was choking on the blood
Whose camouflages, lack of soul
Whose misty fire, muses soul

Kneeling by the harm
Which is promising the way
His poor essence, under the truth
love and heart polish itself
I slid my heels but slowly ran
So send Lucifer into hell
