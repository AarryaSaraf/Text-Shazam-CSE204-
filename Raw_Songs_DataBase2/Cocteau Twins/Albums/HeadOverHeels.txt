// When Mama Was Moth //

Sunburst and snowblind
I'd seen the (I shouldn't fear) 
Fear running down my brook
While mama was clear (queer), 
One more brook
Chills all start screaming
Ribbed and veined
The sunburst and the snowblind
A chill of fear running down my back
When mama was moth, I took bulb form
Body electric
Writhe in vain
Body electric 

Body electric
Body electric
Body electric
Body electric
Body electric

Body electric
Body electric
Body electric
Body electric
Body electric

// Five Ten Fiftyfold //

Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
It halved it in half
And went gushing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing
And in hand a little hand
It halved it in half
By taking it forward
It went gushing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
When gushing gust winds
Turned just up north
Wheezing and sneezing
In hand a little hand
By taking it forward
It went gushing gust wind

Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold

Wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and sneezing and 

Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold
Five Ten Fiftyfold

// Sugar Hiccup //

Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Makes the earth tough and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsey and bow
Sugar hiccup
Makes a pig soar and swoon
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup or she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup or she reels 
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Makes the earth tough and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup or she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup

Heavens curtsey and bow
Sugar hiccup
Makes a pig soar and swoon
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsey and bow
Makes a pig soar and swoon now
Sugar hiccup or she reels
Sugar hiccup, hiccup now
Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Makes the earth tough and tumble

// Glass Candle Grenades //

There's only our hair's breadth between us, obscure as we are
Obscure as we are, there's only our hair's breadth between us
There's only our hair's breadth between us, as sure as we be
As sure as we be, there's only our hair's breadth between us

Glass sandstorms
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)
Glass candle
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)
Grenades are popping
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)

There's only our hair's breadth between us, obscure as we are
Obscure as we are, there's only our hair's breadth between us
There's only our hair's breadth between us, as sure as we be
As sure as we be, there's only our hair's breadth between us

Glass sandstorms
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)
Glass candle
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)
Grenades are popping
(Still we'll not keel over, keel over, keel over)

// In The Gold Dust Rush //

I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold

I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold

In the gold dust rush I can only genuflect
In the gold dust rush I can only genuflect
In the gold dust rush I can only genuflect

In the gold dust rush
In the gold dust rush

Honey (her knee) is horrible
(In the gold dust rush)
There's locusts in (hidden) there
She's got the old fool gold 

Honey (her knee) is horrible
(In the gold dust rush)
There's locusts in (hidden) there
She's got the old fool gold 

(In the gold dust rush)
She's got the old fool gold

I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
In the gold dust rush I can only genuflect
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold

I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold
In the gold dust rush I can only genuflect
I weigh my life and it's got me old fool gold

In the gold dust rush 
In the gold dust rush

Honey (her knee) is horrible
(In the gold dust rush)
There's locusts in (hidden) there
She's got the old fool gold 

Honey (her knee) is horrible

There's locusts in (hidden) there
She's got the old fool gold

// The Tinderbox (Of A Heart) //

They are beaten
You'd feel danger there

Through the edged are beaten
You'd feel danger there

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

Bleed in your fate's ground through the edge
It's so bloody and blunt of big crystal eyes
How heavy you are; it's fading your hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

Bleed in your fate's ground through the edge
It's so bloody and blunt of big crystal eyes
How heavy you are; it's fading your hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

// Multifoiled //

No longer multicolours, multifoiled
No longer multicolours, multifoiled

I'm multifoiled
And time opens wounds, yes
I'm no longer multicolours, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled

Years were filled again
That died of what was sweetest
I'm no longer multicolours, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled

// My Love Paramour //

Two different fates; 
My love paramour ooze out and away
Two different fates; 
My love paramour ooze out and away
Two different fates 
They fig up my love ooze out and away

Two different fates
My love paramour ooze out and away onehow

Love if it's swallowed for pity 
Must ooze out and away onehow

Love if it's swallowed for pity 
Must ooze out and away onehow
Two different fates of my love paramour 
Ooze out and away onehow

Love if it's swallowed for pity 
Must ooze out and away onehow
Two different fates of my love paramour 
Ooze out and away onehow

Two different fates
My love paramour ooze out and away onehow
