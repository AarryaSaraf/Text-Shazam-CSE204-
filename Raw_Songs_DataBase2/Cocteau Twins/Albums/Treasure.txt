Peep hole, peach blow, Pandora, pompadour
Pale leaf, pink sweet, Persephone
Near our Ivo (peep peep hole), bit animal (peep peep)

Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fall
Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fall

// Persephone //

Hey, the chances I must waste 
Hey, ever dirge, even their moth got a jar 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 

Paper chase is on 
These are on my speed 
For you are but 
But around the fold 
On the charnel, by your gin trap 
Paper chase is on 
These are on my space 

Paper chase is on (hey, the chances I must waste)
Hey, the chances I must waste
These are on my speed 
For you are but 
But around the fold 
On the charnel, by your gin trap (hey, ever dirge, even their moth got a jar)
Oh, you are but ever by the jar
Paper chase is on 
These are on my space 
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail

Paperweight means  (hey, the chances I must waste)
Means to paper chase 
For a timepiece 
Never changes this 
Paperweight means 
Paper weight means paper chase
Means to paper chase 
For a timepiece 
Never changes this 
Paperweight means 
Oh, a timepiece never changes this
Means to paper chase 
For a timepiece 
Never changes this 
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes
Is what it takes

Paperweight means 
Means to paper chase 
For a timepiece 
Never changes this
Paperweight means
Mmeans paper chase 
Oh, a timepiece never changes this
Paperweight means 
Means to paper chase 
For a timepiece 
Never changes this

Ya ya ya you are
Ya ya ya you are
Ya ya ya you are
Ya ya ya you are
Ya ya ya you are

Who but who put on the heart, heart, heart, heart
Who've been wounded, who should wound her
Heart on the grasp, heart on the grasp
Who but who put on the heart, heart, heart, heart
Who've been wounded, who should wound her
Heart on the grasp, heart on the grasp
Who but who put on the heart, heart, heart, heart

He must smoke spum dames by our lay
Charge are we nicks, he'll needs our first very edge
Now beautiful I'll tell my mind
Cloud mannered a lot, tell the king to park his soul
Tell the king to park his soul

For being an old beat
So in spirit, so maximum
That only water's more deep
To find him (tell the king to park his soul)

Deals trust him by them all
He must smoke spum dames by our lay
Charge are we nix ill needs our first very edge
Now beautiful I'll tell my mind
How many tell the king to park his soul
Tell the king to park his soul
Tell the king to park his soul

For being an old beat
So in spirit, so maximum
That only water's more deep
To find him (tell the king to park his soul)

I'm sure
Allow me
Please
Get help
Only in your note
Only listen
Where are you going
Oh, the song would
Whose mousse
Sell our little home
That's what I'm saying
It's almost right
It's a loved one
It's oh, so hard
You should go home
Through the pain
Sure
Bravo
Please
Please
Pull
Only the lonely
Sell some
Sell our minnow
Suppose he can
If we aren't home
So come over
So sleep
It's so hard
It's also ugly
Leveled home
Bricks so
So firm
