Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
It's a role, he'll never make a suit
Hang on to this
So stay and spin and fail and fail
Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Furthermore, let's blast it off
I'm dizzy so I go under the Big Dipper
Come fantasy for a carnival
I'm empty before our wedding

Singing on the famous street
I want to love a boy that won't love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
That's why it is more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul
That's like any old playing card
It must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Maybe there, while you was rail
I'll go in and seize your heart and be personal
I suspect I'm singing to you a tune
And still you find the beat and sing it to you soon
