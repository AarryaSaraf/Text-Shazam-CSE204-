I'm so happy to care for you
I only want to love you and
Slip me home as we seal us in
You and that land which one dresh are leaving
Hold me onto a mess a plenty
Me and that land should grow, end to a hard part
Meant a Christmas that's me and a friend
I only want to love you
I only want to love you
I only want to love you
I only want to love you

I'm so happy to care for you,
I only want to love you

I'm so happy to care for you,
I only want to love you

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension(inside you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension(inside you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension
(I only want to love you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big

I'm heart, and in space the plane
On fill our hearts' ascension
(I only want to love you)
It's heft driven since the urge
To sell the place isn't very, very, very big
