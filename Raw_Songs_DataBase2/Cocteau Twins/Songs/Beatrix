Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Every week, move is small
When he cared, when he did love
When he knew, when he'd fall
I hear she'd fall, ha, she fell
Hear she'd fall, ha, she fell

Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fall
Fallen on, fallen on, fallen on, do we?
Fallen on, fallen on me

Fall
