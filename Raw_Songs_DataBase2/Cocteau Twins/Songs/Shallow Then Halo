Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile
The then shallow she
Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred
Stars in my eyes 
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capitol place

Earth as we know it
The then hallow she
A sky for the sacred

In my 
In my 
In my 
In my 


Winged water
Feathered river
Dirty rich soil
Strong and fertile




Stars in my eyes 
Stars in my face
Womb in the belly
Capitol place




In my eyes
At my
Stars in my eyes
In my eyes
At my feet

In my eyes
At my feet
I have stars in my eyes
Stars in my eyes
I have stars in my face

Stars at my feet
Stars at my arms, Stars at my feet 
Stars at my arms, Stars at my feet 
Stars at my arms, Stars at my feet
