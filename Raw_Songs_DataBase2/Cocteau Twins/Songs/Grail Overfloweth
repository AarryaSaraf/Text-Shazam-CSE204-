Grail overfloweth , There is rain
And music, And there is love,
Grail overfloweth , There is rain
And music, And there is love
Grail overfloweth, There is rain
And there's saliva, And there's you
Flinch for him
More than the other fakes
I sleep
Horizontally
You told momma
You speak
You wish me to, See to you
Grail overfloweth
There is rain

Grail overfloweth
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
There is you and me
Grail overfloweth
