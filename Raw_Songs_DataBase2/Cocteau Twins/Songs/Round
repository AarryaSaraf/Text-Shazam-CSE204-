I, I will stay focused
When the thoughts do land
It's positive reinforcement
This sense of movement
This place, enjoy it

It gives me a new sense of progress
Tells me I've got capacity to improve
Yes, I will stay focused
When the thoughts do land
This place, enjoy it

This place, enjoy it 
This place, enjoy it
Enjoy it
