Oh
I'm a bug; June flu
Oh
Missing the rain
Oh
When it must be May soon
Oh
Feasting in May

Maybe we need
Oh
Secretive time
Oh
I've had my May ghosts
Oh
Bury in me
oh
Feasting in May

Helium since your not I am never
Lost and nervous - I'm all wet now

could deserve this bruise in May

Not I argue let no baby tell her
oh play kina on kraufa minyata??
festify he said me gone e mula??

could deserve this bruise in May

oh play kina on kraufa minyata??
festify he said me gone e mula??

Could be a saint

I will transend now
Oh
singular scent

treesap reserve none
oh
doctor signal
