Soon I see it wasn't even he who was less
I almost let us...
Feel the sun
early morning millionaire

Gone against the greater good 
So here's what I do
If I listen we're nowhere 
early morning millionaire

I feel the balance in the solace of the earth
(and I like it...)

I feel the balance in the solace of the earth
(and I like it...)

I feel the balance in the solace of the earth
(and I like it...)
