Carrying prose
Broke my real friend
The devil bites dirty
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane

Licking our wounds
The devil bites dirty
Rattling we'll taste
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane

Caring is a bury gin shot
The devil bites dirty
Up 'till the wee wanes
Oh, we laugh in their faces
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane
