You don't feel damned between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Please them or run on the turf

You could be raising money with your momma
You might be showing you're round 
And dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone

Men are so nice
Lays can be
Roses may fly
Men are so useful
He's a flirt
Men are so useful
Reflection beauty
Men are so nice
He pleases me fine
Reflection beauty
Men are so useful

Be able to feel
Don't feel damned between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Please them or run on the turf

You could be
You could be raising money with your momma
You could be
You might be showing you're round 
And dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone

Men are so nice
Lays can be
He pleases me fine
Men are so useful
He's a flirt
Men are so useful
Reflection beauty
Men are so nice
He pleases me fine
Reflection beauty
Men are so useful

Beautiful hands us no way lies a means of love
Men are so nice
On sounds and guard the stone, and bed had a law
He pleases me fine
Answers written and I reason
He pleases me fine
In the reign of sex, blown more than it's pleased to be
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
Fine, fine
He's a beauty affection, oooh
He's a beauty affection, oooh
He's a beauty affection, oooh
