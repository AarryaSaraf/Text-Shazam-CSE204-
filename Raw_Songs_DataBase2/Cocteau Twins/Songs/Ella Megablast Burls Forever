Men don't tell much
Through the heart and breast
Men don't have that much
Through the heart and breast

Men don't have much
Felt it from the heart again
(For those who accieve this grace)
Don't hold that against me
Felt it from the heart again
(For those who accieve this grace)

Mistakes
Whisked away
Away and
Be joyful and joyful
(Be joyful and joyful)
Mistakes
Whisked away
Away and
Be joyful and joyful
With all the feelings on the ground

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in

Men don't have much
(Through the heart)
Through the heart and breast
The only way in
