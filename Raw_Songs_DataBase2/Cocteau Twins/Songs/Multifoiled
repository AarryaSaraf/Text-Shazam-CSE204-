No longer multicolours, multifoiled
No longer multicolours, multifoiled

I'm multifoiled
And time opens wounds, yes
I'm no longer multicolours, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled

Years were filled again
That died of what was sweetest
I'm no longer multicolours, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled

More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled
