I'm seeming to be glad a lot
I'm happy again, caught, caught in time
Expose the doubt and arm yourself well
Me, I defend with sober heart

You're the maraschino cherry coal (the match of Jerico)?
That will burn this whole madhouse down
And will not throw open like a walnut safe
More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff, yes

You, yourself, and your father
Don't know so much in your own ways
You're really both bone-setters
Thank you for mending me, babies

You will seem more like being
