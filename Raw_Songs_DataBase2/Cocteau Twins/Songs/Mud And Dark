Echo fell in love with the handsome Narcissus
Narcissus saw nymphs who adored him
And wasn't ever raised to their affection

"Is anyone here?" 
"Here here!" 
"Come!"
"Come!" 
"I will die before I give you power over me!"
"I give you power over me!"

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

Naricissus leaned over a clear pool
For a drink and fell hoplessly
In love with his own reflected image

Cursed through thought of futile desire to have his own affection
In turn Narcissis slowly wasted away
And didn't continue to love me

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

All that remains of Echo is her voice in caves 
(all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves)
Still repeating only what others have said 
(still repeating only what others have said)

And death, eventually, overtook him as he stared
He's found a finger for you; "Why would you be so mean?"
And she repeated these same words to him

And Echos fleshes all were scattered about
And her bones turned to stone
Today, all that remains of Echo is her voice in caves

"Is anyone here?" 
"Here, here!"
"Come!"
"Come!"
"I will die, before I give you power over me!"
"I give you power over me."
