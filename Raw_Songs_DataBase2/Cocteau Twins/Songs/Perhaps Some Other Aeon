Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

A change of head in hole
Oh well, if he shaves his headdress

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

I was near when you died at birth
I was near when you were born in death
I've felt the faces within you
It is a more sacred sin then on this list
And on the way there

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon

Perhaps some other animal
Perhaps some other aeon
