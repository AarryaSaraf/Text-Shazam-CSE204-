When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(Deceived me) You deceive me

(With you) Erase it I will not

(to stay) Finishing a halo (didn't he know alice?)

(I will plead) I will not excuse you

(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
would share,
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
who shall
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
replace
(alice, alice, alice, alice, alice)
You

When I am lost in heart ache
Shudder, shatter 
The pale you
My one and only true love

Nicolo 
Espiritu
This is the smoking gun
I really want to see

(pushing me) Look she fell
(with you) Right there on the floor
(so you) Finishing with her life
(not me) It hasn't even started
