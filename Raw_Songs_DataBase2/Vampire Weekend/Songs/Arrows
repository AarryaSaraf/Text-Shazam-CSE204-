I saw you down at the station
Your leather suitcase burst at the seams
Stay all day up in your rooms now
That's not a problem you've ever seen

Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

I awoke up in a bedroom
You'd gone out hunting, I was asleep
Spend my day out at the fountain
That's not a problem you had foreseen

Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

Oh, it's no use at all
But that life in the church could still remain
