Skin under sun
Summer breeze
Summer break

Oh, I was young then
Hadn't made
My mistake

Unaware of the fall
Unaware of my fate

There was peace in the valley
'Til I made my mistake

Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape

Caught at the border

As I made my escape

It was cold
It was dark
You were cruel
You were fake

Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake

There was choice to get out
Or remain in this state

There was springtime and future
'Til I made my mistake

Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape

Caught at the border

As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
I was foolish and lame
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake
