2021, will you think about me?
I could wait a year, but I shouldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)

Copper goes green, steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)

// I'm Going Down //

We sit in the car
Outside your house
I can feel the heat coming 'round
I go to put my arm around you and you
Give me a look like I'm way out of bounds
Well you let out one of your bored sighs and
Lately when I look into your eyes

I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

We get dressed up
And we go
Out - baby for the night
We come home early burning 
Burning for some fire fight
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up, yeah
Setting me up just to knock, knock, knocking me down

Down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

I pull you close, but when we
Kiss - I can feel a doubt
I remember back when we started
My kisses used to turn you inside out

I used to drive you to work in the morning
Friday night I'd drive you all around
You used to love to drive me wild but
Lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me

Down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

Oh, darling I'm going down
I'm going down, down, down, down
I'm going down, down, down, down

// Jonathan Low //

Last born of the clan, first one to be free
Lived inside a house beneath the hanging tree
Londonderry nights that chilled him to the bone
Words were cried at night in unforgiving tones

Blood of his men was gone beneath snow
He picked up his knife and his bow
Killer of Jonathan Low

Violence from without and anger from within
Crawling through the fields, informing next of kin
They all turned their backs, but they all knew his name
And if he could return, they'd probably do the same

Blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low

The blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low

// Ottoman //

Ottoman couch, how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for a funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

Elegant clothes you want to be seen with her
Under your tweeds you sweat like a teenager
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall

Today is for you
They laid it out for you, for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel, too

All of the cards and all of the time it took
Soon it's all lines of red in a leather book
Begging you to wait for a minute by the door
Your creeping feet where they've never been before

Today is for you
They laid it out for you, for you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel, too
