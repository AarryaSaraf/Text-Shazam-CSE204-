Jeffrey's last Christmas, we let him go outside
The dog was slowly dying but we wanted him alive
For just one more holiday season, before we put him down

Jeffrey's last Christmas, we kept calling out his name
But he never came back to us, so a Christmas dog he remains
It was Jeffrey's last Christmas
