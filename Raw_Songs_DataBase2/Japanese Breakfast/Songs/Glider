Come in to me, show us the way
I'm caught between the wind and parts of the unknown
A door between two worlds
A sight to see

It feels like everything is moving
Around me
It feels like it is moving
In time

Glider caught the breeze
Feels like flying
Every particle in synch
Come on and guide me
Glider
Glider
