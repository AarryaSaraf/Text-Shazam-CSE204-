With my luck you'll be dead within the year
I've come to expect it
There's nothing left to fear, at least there's that

Face to face and at my hands I snowed you in
With hydrocodone
Layer by layer 'til you disappeared

Hell is finding someone to love and I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't see you again

Wheeled you in laid on your side
I cried and cried and at my signal
They stopped your heart and then you died

And under the fluorescents another sterile room
Where no one ever tells you just how clinical death looks
And I can't unsee it, the two shots it took

Hell is finding someone to love and I can't have you
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't see you again
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't feel it
Hell is finding someone to love and I can't, I can't
