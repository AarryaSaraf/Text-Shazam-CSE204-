Zuleyka
I love to watch you work
Zuly with those Puerto Rican eyes
Big as baseballs
Oh it kills me

Who wants a drink? How can I serve you, Chinatown patrons of this karaoke bar?
While I'm around the corner, those Korean women, they'll sell me the flowers I buy to take you out

Zuly, promise me
When we make up all of the money
We'll buy us a pick up and leave this town
