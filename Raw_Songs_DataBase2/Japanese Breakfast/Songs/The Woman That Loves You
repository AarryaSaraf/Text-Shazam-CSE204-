You're embarrassing me
With a postponed marriage and a stalled out car
Then you leave me in the back with half a window rolled down
Like a dog (like a dog) in the summer heat

Don't you think? Don't you think
You should try to do as little harm as you can to the woman that loves you

Oh, we'll stay
Oh, we'll stay together
For the weekend, honey
The weekend, babe
Me and you, frosted blues
But we're gazing out for better things

You should try to do as little harm as you can to the woman that loves you
