I thought I saw a hand glider
I wondered if it was tourist season
My body is so warm
Because my blood is flowing

We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way

Boys paint their boats by the water
Where is my great big feeling?
You bought a tai chi sword to practice
It flopped around like a thin limp dick

We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
Where is my great big feeling?
Where is my great big feeling?
Where is my great big feeling to feel?
