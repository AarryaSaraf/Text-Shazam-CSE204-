Dad brought the rock down on its head
Deer head
Splitting its skull open in half
Open

And the blood shone like VHS tape out of its skull and its severed leg
It was the right thing to do
And if purity was quantified, divide it in half each year you're alive
I was happier before
Not quite sure why it was right
