Oh my life
Is changing every day
Every possible way
Oh my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

Never felt like this before
Now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Now I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

I want more
Impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
They'll come true
Impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me

Oh my life
Is changing every day
Every possible way
Oh my dreams
Never quite as it seems
Cause you're a dream to me
Dream to me
