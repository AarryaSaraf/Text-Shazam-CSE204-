Oh I guess it's going to be like this
Quiet from now on
Haven't I felt enough darkness?

And who if not you
Will wrap me up in a cotton towel
When I'm crying in the shower
Every morning?

You say that I'm old enough
I don't feel old enough
You beg me not to swell up with anger
Like I do, but I do, but I do
