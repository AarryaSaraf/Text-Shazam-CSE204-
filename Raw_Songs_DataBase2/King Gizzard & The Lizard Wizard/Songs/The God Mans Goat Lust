Chapter 4.
The God man with the bible was in the back room of the chapel at Fort Whipple. The God man was deeply engrossed in satisfying his goat lust with a Yavapai girl. She never said a damn thing but just leaned over an alter while he defiled her. He held a pistol to her head as he grunted away and when he was finished he shoved her towards the outside door.
But the God man never got to fixing his long johns or his black trousers, the young man named Blue strode softly up behind him and drove a long-bladed knife into his neck. Blood spurted into the chalice on the alter but not the blood of the Christ, just the blood of the God man. With a cough he died, and a bubbled gurgle. The young man named Blue took the Yavapai girl, money, guns, food, two strong horses and rode into the desert away from Fort Whipple. The God man's body was found, but he was not missed.
