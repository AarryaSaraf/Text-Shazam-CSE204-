Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Remember, remember
Tezeta, tezeta

If I've been insane
My whole life well now I've changed
Into something that sees
I love the feeling
Shape shifting ceiling
My mental projection is pink

Come here, girl
Who are you?
I am true perspective

Tezeta, tezeta
Tezeta, tezeta
Nostalgia, nostalgia
Tezeta, tezeta

Everything that lives and dies
Is a hologram
Nothing is as real as that

Come here, boy
Are you God?
I am that which I am

Do you remember now?
What? (Yes, I do!)
This, my altered plan!
