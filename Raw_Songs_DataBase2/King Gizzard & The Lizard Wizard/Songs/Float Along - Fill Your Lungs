I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath

I saw you in the paper folds
Then I saw you in my coffee mug

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath
Just float along and fill your lungs
