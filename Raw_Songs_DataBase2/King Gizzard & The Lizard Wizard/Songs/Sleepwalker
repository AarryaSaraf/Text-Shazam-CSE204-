Ooh ooh, hee hee hee...

Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to walk in the ocean

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee
Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to sleepwalk with you, ohooh now

I caught you sleeping on the wrong side of the bed
So I got up, wow wow, switched my side
Your voice gets hoarse when you get too cold
I'll warm you up, wow wow, warm you up

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee

If you're thinking then you're thinking too hard
So squish your brain, wow wow, numb the pain

Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee, sleepwalker
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee
Well I want to, I want to, I want to
I want to sleepwalk with you, ohooh now
Ooh ooh, hee hee hee, hee hee
