Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
And I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct
Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
And I'm dreamin'
Stressin' is an instinct

Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

Safe travel
Walk into another
Well I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct
My apartment
Is a clever lover
He told me
Stressin' is an instinct

Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
I'm feeling
Stressin' is an instinct
Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
I'm dreaming
Stressin' is an instinct
