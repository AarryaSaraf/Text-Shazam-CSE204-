Push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
Oh, it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

And push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, oh, oh, oh...
