Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep!

You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!


Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored

Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!

You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog


I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at it's expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot

Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, oh!

Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, yes, oh!


For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemathe
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned
