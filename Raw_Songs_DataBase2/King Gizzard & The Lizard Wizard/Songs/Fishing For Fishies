Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

Don't matter to kiss
And put that poor fishie should be free

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
All heights honk
Ego tying knots being fate
Don't do it
You ain't a God
Don't hunt salmon, cod or carp

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

It seems like cruelty to me
And I'm hungry, leave them be

I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
I don't want to be fishing for fish
I just want to let them freely swim
All heights honk
Egos tying knots being fate
Don't do it
You ain't a God
Don't hunt salmon, cod or carp

Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies
Fishing for fishies
Don't make them feel happy
Or me neither
I feel so sorry for fishies

I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I've left them swum
I've left them swum
I've left them swum
I've left them swum

I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
I have been fishing
And I don't want to catch none
