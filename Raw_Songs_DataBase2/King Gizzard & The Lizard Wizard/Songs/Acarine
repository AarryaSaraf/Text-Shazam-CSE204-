I am the honeybee
Drink the blood of the tree
I can't breathe, I can't see
Evil wind comforts me

Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine

Little mite, so much strife
Multiplied through a knife
I can't fly, I can't cry
Acarine, make me die

Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Buried deep inside of me
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine

Glory darkness, come see
The leaf, nothing
Saw smoke, life

Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
Acarine
