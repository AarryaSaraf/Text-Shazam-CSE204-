Well I ain't dumb
But I ain't that smart
And I can't spell
But I can sound it out

Gotta keep your high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low

Well I ain't dumb
But I ain't that smart
And I can't spell
But I can sound it out

Gotta keep your high hopes low
High hopes low, high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low, yup

Well I ain't slow
My high hopes low
My high hopes low
My high hopes low
My high hopes low, oh
High hopes low
