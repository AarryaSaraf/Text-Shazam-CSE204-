I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

I know within my body
I need rest from muscle ache
I really need a break
So I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

I know within my body
I need to locate the switch
Hidden in me which
Will turn me off, off, off
I know within my body, I need it

I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it

I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

I know within my body
I've got sleepy appetite
Pray the darkest night
I'm sleepin' in, in
I'm sleepin' in

I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it
