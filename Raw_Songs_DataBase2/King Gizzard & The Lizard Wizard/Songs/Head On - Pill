Just yesterday I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my

Head on
Head on

Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my

Head on
Head on
Head on
Head on
