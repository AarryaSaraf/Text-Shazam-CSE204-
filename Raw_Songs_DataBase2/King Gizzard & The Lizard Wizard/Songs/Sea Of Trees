Oh hell, I'm feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I'm feeling kinda sick
I don't know what's the use in it
And when you're feeling suicidal
Sometimes you've just got to unfold

Oh hell, I'm feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I'm feeling like a prick
I don't know what's the use in it
And when you're feeling suicidal
Sometimes you've just got to unfold
