When you make time
To clear the cobwebs off your mind
You may find yourself unwind
When all the ticking stops dead
You may find your time instead
And you can be your silhouette

When you just stop
And take a look around your shop
You may feel your blues all drop
You can't sell your glum to me
But I can help you til' you see
That you can be your silhouette

It may be dark
It may be shadowy and stark
But don't be scared of what you've met
Your dance with it is no threat
In fact it is an asset
You can be your silhouette
