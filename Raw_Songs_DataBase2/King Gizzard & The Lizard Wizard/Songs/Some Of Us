Ancient tombs like sand filled wombs of peoples life past
Understand everything
Melted iron
Untold aeons
Crafted demise
Destroying everything

Black sand timelines
Shifting skylines
Faded guide signs revealing everything
Ancient Thracians from lost nations
Long gone people understand everything

Some, some of us see
Some, some of us don't
Assured everything turns into dust

Rigor mortis fossil tortoise remains dormant underneath everything
Ageless microbes reveal xenophobes
Endless plague thus infecting everything

Sapien rituals born of mind tools
Sects of false gods fade into everything
Eternal tribes of purgatory scribes
Ancient words thus foretelling everything

Some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust

Some, some of us live
Some, some of us die
Assured everything turns into dust
