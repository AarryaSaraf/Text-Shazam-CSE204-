I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company
The city keeps me company

Sit on the roof
Watch the cars travel past
Ain't no way of getting lonely
And I'll sit real still and watch everyone go fast
With only me

Lay on the bay
Watch it all float away
Ain't no way of getting lonely
Watch all the people and the bikes come my way
With only me

I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
I'm not lonely
