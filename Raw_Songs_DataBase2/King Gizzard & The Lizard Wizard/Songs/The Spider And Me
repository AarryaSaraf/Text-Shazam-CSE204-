Let me just introduce you to my friend
Under the tree
Spider and me
All day we'll sit about, giggling free
Under the tree
Spider and me

Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me

Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

Love from a spider is nothing stranger
Than my admiring
Love of nature
Am I a hippie if I have this love?
We are the same stuff
From the same cloth

Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me
Spider and me (Spider and me)

Laze in the afternoon sun
Gazing at each other's beauty
The huntsman's heart forever beats
Our union is forever

Let me just introduce you to my friend
Under the tree
Spider and me
