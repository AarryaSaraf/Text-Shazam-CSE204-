I've got ideas in my brain
About the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain
Will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

Well everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear even the oceans changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear even the sky has changed, its blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

Well everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear even the ocean changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

I've got ideas in my brain
About the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain
Will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh if we save her, we'll live on a star
'Cause Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
