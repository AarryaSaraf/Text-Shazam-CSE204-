Now there is something that's on my mind. Now there is something I cannot hide. Why is there is there anyone? Why do we think? What is the point of it? Why anything? Why is there anything? What is the link? What is the point of it? Why anything?

Don't question. Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. Be free.

What can be said to exist inside a simulation inside my mind? What is the meaning? What is a thing? What is the point of it? Why anything? How many levels of ontology? What is the point of it? Why anything?

Don't question. Thinking for yourself is an overrated thing. Be free.
