// Without The One You Love //

Baby, I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now, baby
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
I don't care if I stay like this, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

When I feel that old hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin' (Right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head, and I sadly reply

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like the wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within
(Baby, I need your good lovin')
I need you, my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms
Ooh, and fill my empty life

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
That I'm feelin'
(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it 'cause

Without the one you love, oh, life ain't worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, oh, I'm like a motherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because without the one you love, oh, life is not worthwhile, no, no
Without the one you love, life ain't worthwhile

// Knock On My Door //

If you think you're all alone in the world
Carrying a heavy load
You wanted to search (You wanted to search)
Your heart to know (Your heart to know)
That you got someone right down the road

Just knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

If you're feeling pain and you're feeling shame
And you have nowhere to go
Don't despair, baby (Don't despair, baby)
I'll be there, baby (I'll be there, baby)
To solve them every blow

All you gotta do is knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

Pull aside your foolish pride
Hold your head up high
'Cause you've got someone on your side
That all the money in the world can't buy

Oh, just to know that there is someone else
Who will understand and care
We'll give you strength, baby, to carry on
And solve the problems that we share

Oh, just knock on my door
Knock on my door
Knock on my door
And I'll be standing there

(I'll be standing there)
You know I'll be there, baby
Knock, I'll be standing there
I'll be there, baby
Knock, I'll be standing there
All you gotta do is knock, I'll be standing there

// Reach Out And Touch (Somebody's Hand) //

Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can

(Just try)
Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement
To someone who's lost the way
(Just try)
Or would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you
To share a problem that's not your own
We can change things if we start giving
Why don't you

Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can

(Just try)
If you see an old friend on the street
And he's down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
(Just try)
Try a little kindness you'll see
It's something that comes very naturally
We can change things if we start giving

Why don't you
Reach out and touch
Why don't you (Why don't you)
Reach out and touch somebody's hand

Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
If you can

// Stoned Soul Picnic //

Can you surry, can you picnic, whoa?
Can you surry, can you picnic?
Come on, come on and surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic (Can you surry, can you picnic?)

Stoned soul, stoned soul, whoa

Come on, come on and surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic (Can you surry, can you picnic?)

Stoned soul, stoned soul
Surry on, soul

Surry, surry, surry, surry

There'll be trains of blossoms (There'll be trains of blossoms)
There'll be trains of music (There'll be music)
There'll be trains of trust, trains of golden dust
Come along and surry on, sweet trains of thought, surry on down
Can you surry, can you surry? (Can you surry?)

Surry down to a stoned soul picnic
Surry down to a stoned soul picnic (Can you surry, can you picnic?)
There'll be lots of time and wine
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine (Red yellow honey)
Red yellow honey, sassafras and moonshine, moonshine
Stoned soul, yeah
Surry on, soul

Surry, surry, surry, surry
Surry, surry, surry, surry
Surry, surry, surry, surry
Surry, surry, surry, surry

// Baby (You've Got What It Takes) //

Well, now, it takes more than a Robin to make the winter go
And it takes two lips of fire to melt away the snow
Well, it takes two hearts a cookin' to make a fire grow
And baby, you've got what it takes, yeah

You know it takes a lot of kissin'
(Tell me about it)
To make a romance sweet
Ooh, it takes a lot of lovin' to make my life complete
And it takes a lot of woman to knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes

I said, "Mm, mm, mm, uh huh, mm, mm, mm
Ah, ah, hah, mm, mm"
You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more than an effort to stay away from you
It'd take more than a lifetime to prove that I'll be true

But it takes somebody special to make me say, "I do"
(Oh, yeah)
And baby, you've got what it takes
Ah, ah, hah, mm, mm, uh huh, mm, mm, mm

You know you've got just what it takes
Because it takes, you're back in my spot again, honey
(Oh yeah, I like your spot)
To stay away from you
(I can't stay away from you)
It takes more than a lifetime, daddy
To prove that I'll be true, now it's you

But, it takes somebody special
(Like me, baby)
To make me say, "I do"
And baby, you've got what it takes, say it again

C'mon, let's do it one more time, all right?
And baby, you've got what it takes
And baby, you've got what it takes

// River Deep-Mountain High //

When I was a little girl, I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Well, I love you just the way I loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown

And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
That it gets higher day by day

Oh, do I love you, my, oh, my
Ooh, baby, river deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, oh, oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

When you were a young girl, did you have a puppy
That always followed you around?
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never let you down

'Cause it goes on and on like the river flows
And it gets deeper, baby, heaven knows
And it gets sweeter, baby, as it goes

Do I love you, my, oh, my
River deep, mountain high (I said so high)
If I lost you, would I cry
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

I love you, baby, like a flower loves spring
And I love you, baby, like a robin loves to sing
Ooh, ooh, and I love you, baby, like a schoolgirl loves her pie, yeah
And I love you, baby, river deep and mountain high

I love you, baby
A mountain so high
A river deep
Ooh, oh, baby, baby
I love you, baby
I bet you do
Ooh, I love you, baby
Tell me you love me
Yes, I do, oh

Do I love you, my, oh, my (Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me)
River deep, mountain high
Oh, if I lost you, would I cry (Would I cry, baby)
Oh, how I love you, baby, baby, baby

Tell me, do you love me, baby?
I love you, yeah
River so deep, mountain so high
Oh, yeah, baby
Oh-ho, yeah
River deep, mountain high
River so deep, mountain so, so, so, so high
That's how I love you, baby
High, high, high, high, high, high, high, yeah, baby
I love you, baby, yes, yes, yes, I do
Tell me, tell me, tell me one more time

// Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing //

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hangin' on the wall
It can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters when you're not near 
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I play the game, a fantasy
I pretend I'm not in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me 

No other sound os quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
So let's stay together

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone
I'm well aware nothing can take the place of being there

So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

// Everyday People //

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the thinker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah

There is a blue one, who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
We got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me you load me and then
You can't figure out what bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah

There is a long hair, who doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
We got to live together

There is a yellow one, who doesn't like the black one
Who won't accept the red one, who won't accept the white one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
I am everyday people

'Cause there is a blue one, who can't accept the green one
For living with the fat one, trying to be a skinny one
There is a long hair, who doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that doesn't help the poor one
I am everyday people

'Cause there is a yellow one, who don't accept the black one
Who won't accept the red one, who won't accept the white one
I am everyday people

// It's Got To Be A Miracle (This Thing Called Love) //

All it takes is 2 hearts that care
Sprinkle just a little tenderness there
& like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high
Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
Take a boy like you & a girl like me
2 lonely people we used to be
We shared a little time, tears & laughter
It seems that we will be happy ever after

All it takes is 2 arms that know
They gotta hold you, baby, & never let go
Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss
We know that heaven must be like this

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
I used to wander, I used to roam
Like a ship in a stormin' sea, tryin' to get home
When we found each other, heaven found a way
'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day

All it takes is just a little time
3 little words, baby, that mean "Will you will be mine?"
Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed
& every sweet word that's ever been said

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
Take a girl like me & a boy like you
Long lonely hours we once knew
We have each other & live what life's worth
All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth

It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love

// Taste Of Honey //

Winds may blow over icy sea
I'll take with me the warmth of thee
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter, sweeter than wine

I will return, I'll return
Oh, I'll come back for the honey and you
Now baby, hey.

I'll leave behind my heart to wear
And may it ever remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine

I will return, I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

He never came back to his love so fair
And so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss was honey
A taste much bitter than wine
Oh, baby, baby, baby

I'll return (come on back)
I'm coming back (come on back)
I'll be back now baby (come on back)
I'll be back, ooo, I'll come back for the honey
And you, baby (honey!)
You, baby (honey!), you, baby
I'm coming back now baby (come on back)

// Together We Can Make Such Sweet Music //

Ho, why should you go to the left?
Why should I go to the right?
Why must we argue this way?
Why must we fuss and fight?

Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, mmm, mmm

Now when you're feelin' bad, I am feelin' it too
Whatever your dreams are, I'll share them with you
Till life has ended, I'll stay by your side
You are my sunshine and you are my pride

Oh, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right, ooh, ooh

Whoa, whoa, I know the love we share is locked in our hearts
And there is nothing that can tear us apart
Wherever you are that's where I'll be
I'll keep this love that you've given to me

Whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
Whoa, whoa, together we can make such sweet music
Together we can make it right
