Album: MainStreetPeople

// Main Street People (Intro) //

[indistinct chatter, sounds of traffic]
[scat singing]

We've made some progress, this I know
Look around you'll see it show
Men on the moon and watching it on TV

We move ahead at breakneck speed
There ain't no end to the things we need
All for the betterment of you and me

But if someone should ask, "Would it be too great a task
To see the world the way it used to be?"
Whatever happened to the days we met on Main Street?
All we ever wanted to do was sing and dance
Maybe we could go back again and look for Main Street

But sad as it may be, people we never get the chance

Whatever happened to the days we met on Main Street?

// I Just Can't Get You Out Of My Mind //

Call me, were the last words I remember
Then the spring became December
And I still got no reply

Politely, I would ask whoever knew ya
What it was that I did to ya
But they all knew less than I

If this letter doesn't make it clear
Its been a cold and lonely year
In my empty bed, in my head I can feel you near

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

It's funny on the outside love was showin'
And I had no way of knowin'
You were all mixed up inside

Oh baby, if we'd only done some talkin'
You could've saved yourself some walkin'
Well, I guess they call that pride

I swear you haven't been away too long
I can still hear your favorite song
This was once your home, on my own now, it feels all wrong

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

Oh, baby [?] oh sugar
If this letter doesn't make it clear
It's been a cold and lonely year
In my empty bed, in my head I can feel you near

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

Oh, I just can't get you out of my mind
Don't you have a heart, I've served my time
Oh, it just ain't right what I'm goin' through
Ten to one, I'm bettin', girl there's no forgettin' you

// Sweet Understanding Love //

Into my life you came
Spreading a glow, you shared my name
Baby, Lord knows I'm not ashamed
To tell the whole world I love you, yeah

Stretch out your hand and pick me up
Nourish me from the lovin' cup
With a love that filled me up
Till my cup runneth over

With your sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

Picked me up when they tore me down
Rescued me from the underground
Encircled me with your lovin' arms
And I'll always be thankful

Look at me, I'm a brand new man
With you a part of my master plan
Now I'm ready to take a stand
'Cause you made me a winner

With your sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
Is sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

L, L-O-V-E

L is for the new love you gave me
When I thought mine was through

O, L-O-V-E, love

O is for the only love I've ever known
Given to me by you

V, L-O-V-E, love

V is for the value
Of our priceless understanding

E, L-O-V-E, love

E is everlasting, girl

Sweet-er, understanding love
Undemanding love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby
Sweet-er and undying love
Undenying love
And it's sho nuff love, hey baby

Sweet, understanding love
Undemanding love...

// Are You Man Enough? //

There's not a street that you can walk.
You got to watch just who you're talkin' to.
They're out to get ya, can't turn your back on a smilin' face.
Next thing ya know, there ain't no trace of you.
And this I betcha...some people lose, and some folks win.
It's a matter of what they do.

Are you man enough...big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend.
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough...when the goin's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

There's no pretending it goes away.
With every step that you take...you pay your dues.
And I ain't lyin'.
You got to struggle to see the light.
How someone's lookin' to steal your right to choose.
And don't stop tryin'.
It's like a jungle outside the door,
and it's keepin' you so confused.

Are you man enough...big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?

Gotta keep your eye on the passers-by.
Better watch your step!
'Cause ya never know where the knife will go,
and they ain't missed yet!
The strong survive, they stay alive,
They always cool,
But that they never teach you in school.

Are you man enough...big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend.
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough...when the goin' get's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

Are you man enough...big and bad enough? (Are you big & bad enough?)
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries,
Are you gonna be around?
