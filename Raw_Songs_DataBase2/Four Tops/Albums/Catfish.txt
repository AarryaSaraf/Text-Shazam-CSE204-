Album: Catfish

// Catfish //

Hey, hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey
She was a disco queen
She came from New Orleans
Catfish was her name
Dancin' was her claim to fame

She took me to a fish fry
The girl danced all night
Catfish sure was nice
She makes my nature rise

Ooh, she was amazin'
She kept her guessin'
But Lord, as she danced across the floor
So tantalizin'
So satisfyin'
So hypnotizin'
So mesmerizin'

What a girl she is
I wanna be with her
And dance forevermore

Oh, let me tell you about
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise
Get on down, girl
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise

Boogie for 'em, Catfish
She makes my nature rise

Hey, hey, hey, hey Catfish
Rise

Ooh, she's amazin'
She kept everybody guessin'
You oughta been there
As she moved
And grooved across the floor

Catfish was tantalizin'
Appetizin', satisfyin'
Mesmerizin', so hypnotizin'
Yes, she can boogie
I just wanna dance with her forevermore

Let me tell y'all
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise

Hey, listen
She's from New Orleans
Former beauty queen
Grandma raised her on collard greens
She did, hey, hey
Catfish makes my nature rise
Catfish makes my nature rise

She's got great big boots
And a booty to boot
Boy, that girl can shoot the coop
She can
Catfish
Catfish makes my nature rise

// You Can't Hold Back On Love //

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

From the day that I learned your name
Everything's been re-arranged
You came into my life like no one ever can, ooh my, my
Now you say the feelings have changed
That you've been hurt and loved once
And you don't want to be hurt and loved again

But how could you put a hold on your heart
That's when the hurt starts
That's when the hurt starts, my, my

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

Why should I be judge by his mistakes?
Especially when there're so much state, baby
Your heart, my heart falls apart
Oh, baby, baby, baby, that's when the hurt starts
That's when the hurt starts, my, my

Breaking up is such a hard thing to do
When you know you've got love that's still true
It's not fair to me, it's not fair to you
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, think it through
I want you to think it through, baby
I want you to think it through, baby

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it

You can't hold back on love
Don't you try it, you can't deny it
You can't hold back on love
