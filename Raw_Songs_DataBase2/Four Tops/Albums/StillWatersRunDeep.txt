// Still Water (Love) //

(Walk with me
Take my hand)

(Still water)
Still water

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

Walk with me
Take my hand

Still waters

Still water
Walk with me
Take my hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep

// Reflections //

Through the mirror of my mind
Time after time
I see reflections of you and me

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

Oh, I'm all alone now
No love to shield me
Trapped in a world
That's a distorted reality

Happiness you took from me
And left me alone
With only memories

Through the mirror of my mind
Through these tears that I'm crying
Reflects a hurt I can't control
'Cause although you're gone
I keep holding on
To the happy times
Oh, when you were mine

As I peer through the window
Of lost time
Looking over my yesterdays
And all the love I gave all in vain
(All the love) All the love
That I've wasted
(All the tears) All the tears
That I've tasted
All in vain

Through the hollow of my tears
I see a dream that's lost
From the hurt
That you have caused

Everywhere I turn
Seems like everything I see
Reflects the love that used to be

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

After all the nights
I sat alone and wept
Just a handful of promises
Are all that's left of loving you

Reflections of
The way life used to be
Reflections of
The love you took from me

In you I put
All my faith and trust
Right before my eyes
My world has turned to dust

// It's All In The Game //

Many a tear have to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things 
Your hearts can rise above

Once in a while he will call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly
Away

(Soon he'll be there at your side)
With a sweet bouquet
Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your hearts will fly 
Away

// Everybody's Talkin' //

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

People stopping, staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast winds
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
Can't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind
I won't let you leave my love behind
No, I won't let you leave
I won't let you leave my love behind

// Love Is The Answer //

Baby, I need Your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now
Baby, so come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because

I'm not livin', baby
I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
Don't care if I stay like this, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms and
Make my life worthwhile

When I feel the hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin'
(Right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head and I sigh and reply

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like a wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms
And fill my empty life

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

// I Wish I Were Your Mirror //

I'll make sure you see me everyday, oh yeah
And though you smile at me, a quick hello is all you ever said
(I wish I were your mirrow now)
So you would stare at me
(I wish I were your sweater now)
At least you'd wear me

'Cause when you look at me
I know I don't exist
But everytime I look at you
I can almost feel your lovin' kiss
I wish I were your pillow (Wish I were your pillow)
You rest your head upon
I wish I were the big, big beat of your very (Wish I were your heartbeat)
You need to rely upon
There's no name, no word
Good enough I guess (Good enough) (Good enough)
An angel's strength in heaven
Baby that's the best I can express

(I wish that I were your mirrow now)
Whoo!
(I wish that I were your mirrow now)
Don't you know that I do?

Just because I want you, I can't make you want me
Just because I want you, I cannot make a flower turn into a tree

(How I wish I were your only)
Yeah baby I do
(Though you don't think about it all)
You write it, you smell it, you turn around whenever and it's gone!

I wish I were your water girl
That you take your shower in
I wish I were the sweet, sweet, sweet Camay
I always smell beneath your lovely, lovely skin
I wish I were your mirror (Wish I were your mirror)
You'd carry everywhere (Wish I were your mirror)
How I wish I were your mirror
You'd handle me with so much love and care
I wish that I were your mirror

// Elusive Butterfly //

You might wake up some mornin'
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch a fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me runnin'
Through the long-abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathin'

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing somethin' I'm not sure of
Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Across my dreams with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

// L.A. (My Town) //

L.A. my town
I love you
L.A. my town
I love you
Ran through Santa Monica
Those sandy shores and sandy streets
Window shop in Hollywood
With movie stars beneath my feet

Oh, I love Angel City
You are really so pretty
In L.A (La-lala-lala)
In L.A (La-lala-lala)
La-lala-lala
La-lala-lala

L.A
My town
I love you
L.A. (my town)
My town
Oh, I love you
(Even in the wintertime
She wears a smile
Of bright sunshine)
Olvera Street and Chinatown
(Angels Flight, let's take a ride)

Oh, I love Angel City
Blue skies above us, so pretty
In L.A (La-lala-lala)
In L.A (La-lala-lala)
La-lala-lala
La-lala-lala

Bababa bababa
Bababa bababa
Bababa bababa
L.A
L.A
L.A
L.A
The sun is shining now
And you can see it
Feet on the ground
Don't they see it
The sun is shining, baby
In L.A. city
Oh, get on down
Where the mini-skirt girls are pretty
In L.A. City

// Still Water (Peace) //

Walk with me
Take my hand

(Still water)
(Still water)

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

Walk with me
Take my hand
Still water
Still water
(Walk with me, take my hand)
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
...
