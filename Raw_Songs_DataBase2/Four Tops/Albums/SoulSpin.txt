// Got To Get You Into My Life //

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

Got to get you into my life
Somehow, someway

What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day?

// This Guy's In Love With You //

You see this guy
This guy's in love with you
Really?

Yeah, I'm in love
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell
We know each other very well
How can I show you
Talk to me baby
I'm glad I got to know you now

I've heard some talk
They say you think I'm fine
Do you really think I'm fine
Yeah, I'm in love
And what I'd do 
To make you mine
Tell me now, is it so?
Don't let me be 
The last to know
My hands are shaking
Don't let my heart 
Keep breaking, 'cause

I want your love
I need your love
Say you're in love
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die

Please tell me now, is it so?
Right now
Don't let me be the last to know
Oh, my hands are shaking
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause

I need your love
I want your love
I need your love

// Light My Fire //

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

// Honey //

See the tree, how big it's grown,
But friend, it hasn't been too long it wasn't big
I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out
To brush the snow away so it wouldn't die...
Came runnin' in all excited slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed 'til I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve 2 years ago

And it would sure embarrass her 
When I came in from workin' late cause I would know
That she'd been sittin there an' cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car, and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But, what the heck though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me and hugged my neck...

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly, in the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring
When flowers bloom, and robins sing, she went away...

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home, 
While she was there and all alone the angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived, and Honey played and love grew up
And a small cloud passes over head
And cries down on the flower bed that Honey loved

And see the tree how big it's grown
But, friend it hasn't been too long, it wasn't big
And I laughed at her, she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig...

// The Look Of Love //

The look of love 
Is in your eyes
The look your smile can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more
Than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start
Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

// California Dreamin' //

All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)

I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day

Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)
And I pretend to pray (I pretend to pray)

You know the preacher light the coal (Preacher light the coal)
He knows I'm gonna stay (Knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)

If I didn't tell her (If I didn't tell her)
I could leave today (I could leave today)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
