// I Am Your Man //

Woo hoo, baby baby, baby baby

Rely on me, to supply your needs from now on
Shelter you, and be a pillar to lean on
For in your eyes I see what I was born to be

And now, now my life can begin
'Cause I am your man (I am your man)
Oh yes I am, yes I am, little darlin'
I, I'm your man

Listen baby
There's no sacrifice, great or small, I wouldn't do for you
My ambition is, bringin' happiness to you
And if trouble comes our way
I won't run, I promise to stay

Right by your side, that's where I'm gonna stay
'Cause I am your man (I am your man)
Oh, yes I am, baby
I, I'm your man

And my childish days are through
I wanna be someone you can look up to
Oh, someone who can protect you
Someone you can respect
Oh, I'm trying to make myself worth it
Of all the love I know you've been givin' me
I want nothin' more for myself
Your love is my greatest wealth

And when you take my hand
You can proudly say, "This is my man"
I am your man
Yes I am, yes I am, darlin'
I, I'm your man
(Baby don't worry) Baby don't you worry
(I am your man) I am your man
I'll be there in a hurry
I, I'm your man
Baby, baby, baby
(I am your man)

// (It's The Way) Nature Planned It //

Baby, don't fight it
I'm comin' baby

Do you know how long a tree lives
Or the reason it grows?
You may ask me all these questions
But darling, no one knows

It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do
Do you ask the Lord who loves you
Why He paints the sky clear blue?

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

Oh, don't ask me how long I'll love you
When you're gone, my heart aches
I'll never, never leave you
Girl, all my life, for you I'd wait 'cause it's the way

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

Don't fight it, baby
I'm coming, girl

It should be clear, I really love you
Don't ask me why, I just do 'cause it's the way
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Like the stars and the sky and the beautiful heaven

It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
We were meant, we were meant to stay together

Why does a flower grow?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Why does the river flow?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

We were meant, we were meant
We were meant, we were meant to stay together

Why does it rain?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it
Why do I feel this way?
It's the way, it's the way nature planned it

// I'll Never Change //

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

I still get that same old feeling inside of me
Time ain't the healing thing like it's supposed to be
The leaves will fall outside, come again in the springtime

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

In time, the water change the rocks to sand
In time, a boy will grow up into a man
Highways will rise up from the dust, a city won't feel us

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)

You'll love with me for eternity
The pain of loving you has left its mark
(Can't stop, can't stop loving you again)
And still I find myself rushing to your heart
(Can't stop, can't stop loving you again)
I'm like a ship whose anchor fell to the bottom of love

And I'll never change (oh, no)
Never stop loving you
Tears fall like rain (tears fall like rain, like rain and I'll never stop)
I'll never stop loving you (never stop loving you)
And I'll never change, no baby (oh, no)
I'll never stop loving you
I'll never change
No I'll never stop loving you
I won't change

// She's An Understanding Woman //

She comes to me, when my spirit's low
She sticks right on em down plan to get up and go
Even when my attitude is negative as can be
Oh, she's so positive, that is starts changing me

She's an understanding woman, oh...
She knows how to give and take, and we all know that that makes
Her an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ah, she's my cutie pie and I'm gonna love her till the day I die

She's right on time, every step of the way
So full of laughter, so full of play
And every time she sees a bit of gloom coming on
One kiss after another (until all the gloom is gone)

Oh, she's an understanding woman
Well, come make up very simple, with a cute little nose and a dimple
She's an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ah, sweet little gift from the lord above
She's kind of born to be full of love

Oh, how can I lose with her by my side
She's my rabbits foot, my lucky charm
Scares off the blues like a scarecrow in a field of corn
I can feel her strange magic, when I'm holding her, in my arms

Oh, she's an understanding woman, oh...
She knows how to give and take, and we all know that that makes
My baby an understanding woman (she's right on time)
Ooh, yes she is not, yes she is not
My baby an understanding woman, ahh-ha
She's right on time

// I Can't Quit Your Love //

The love was standing on is shaky ground
There ain't no way on earth to hold you down
And every road I take to you higher ooh yea ha

I gonna find a boat to row away
Where I won't be reaching for you night and day
Where there's no windows ain't no doors
To let your love in ooh I, I

I can't quit your love, ooh yeah
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love, no I can't
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, ooh yeah

You snap your fingers and I feel on fire
Like silly spinning wheels of desire
You have to be a bird with wings to get me higher

The minor things for me has lose control
The weakness of my judgment rules my soul
You know you got each claim in me after the wire, ooh

I can't quit your love, ooh yeah
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love, no I can't
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, ooh yeah

// Walk With Me, Talk With Me, Darling //

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

Oh, love feels good
So you want it to stay with you
You look to me for the way
Some search forever before it's found
But this is my way, girl, to keep love around

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness

Everybody has to take
Although it might end in pain
Forget the future, girl
Just love today

We're gonna make it all the way

Come on and walk with me

And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

(Come on and walk with me)
Come on and walk with me
(Come on and talk to me)
Talk to me, baby

Hold on to my heart
And put all your faith in me
Together we'll weather the storm
Be cool in sunshine
Stay dry in the rain
If something hurts us, girl, we'll never feel the pain

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here
And we'll have happiness
The way that it's supposed to be

Come on and walk with me
Oh baby, talk to me
Come on and show me
That you love me for eternity
Come on and say you care
Tell me you'll stay right here

// Happy (Is A Bumpy Road) //

Here I go again
I hear your footsteps running up and down my brain
And in my darkest hour
I see your face

If I, can see you
Why can't I be with you?
I know the mountain's high
We can climb it if we try, try, try

And happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, I know
And happy is a bumpy road
We can make it

We're like children holding hands
And if you slip, you know that I will help you stand
'Cause in my solitude
You gave me hope

So if I, can see you
Why can't I be with you?
I know the struggle's great
But buried arms we can break, I know

Happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, girl I know
Happy is a bumpy road
We can make it, if we try

Yeah
If I can see you (Why can't I be with you?)
Why can't I be with you?
Baby, I know the mountain's so high
But we can climb it if we try, try, try

Happy is a bumpy road
I know we can make it
(Happy is a bumpy road)
We just have to try
Happy is a bumpy road
(Happy is a bumpy road)

// How Will I Forget You //

Light up of reflections
Glowing warming your completion
Must I be reminded oh so constantly
You mean everything to me
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me baby (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)

With the pale moon high above me
And your warm eyes saying you love me
A million moonbeams can't erase the visions of your lovely face
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me baby (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Baby baby

Oh, when I met you baby, I thought I would be free
I never stopped to realize, you're a part of me, girl
With the pale moon high above me
And your warm eyes telling me you love me
A million moonbeams can't erase the visions of your lovely face
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me that you love me (how will I forget you)
Will I ever forget you (baby baby)
Oh baby

When I left you baby, I thought I would be free
I never stopped to realize, you're a part of me
You know you are
With the pale moon high above me
And no body here to love me

Must I be reminded, oh so constantly
Hey you mean everything to me (baby baby)
Ah-ha-ha-ha yeah (how will I forget you)
I don't want to look at you baby (baby baby)
But how can I help myself (how will I forget you)
Baby baby (baby baby)
How am I ever gonna forget you (how will I forget you)
How will I forget you (baby baby)
Tell me can I forget you (how will I forget you)
