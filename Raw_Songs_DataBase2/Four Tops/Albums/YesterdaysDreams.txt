// Yesterday's Dreams //

Yesterday's dreams today are sorrow
Just like your love, girl, fading away
Yesterday's love won't last till tomorrow
I know you're leaving, but what can I say?
Oh (oh) wish that I could find a way
To make you stay; I've got to prove to you
That I love you, I need you, oh how I need you
Don't go (don't go) don't go (don't go)
If you go, don't you know
You're gonna leave me with...

Yesterday's dreams though gone & behind us
They're lonely reminders of plans that we made
Yesterday's plans today gone forever
But they're locked here inside me & they never will fade
Although (although) you may go, time will show me
Dreamin' still, & I always will
'Cause I love you, I need you, oh how I need you
Don't you go (don't go) don't you leave me, baby (don't go)
Baby don't you leave me (don't go) please don't leave me
(Don't go) here with yesterday's dreams

Although (although) you may go, time will show me
Dreamin' still, & I always will
Yesterday's dreams are a small pile of ashes
With one burning hope that hangs on

// I'm In A Different World //

In this world of ups and downs
My dreams all fall through
Things just don't work out
No matter what I do

Disappointment haunts me
Through each lonely day
The world around I see
In only shades of gray

But when the love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world I never knew
I'm in a different world
A world so sweet and true
I'm in a different world

I'm no longer just another face
In a crowd
Hey, look into my eyes
You'll see I'm strong and I'm proud

You are all the sweetness
Of my life, you see
You have brought heaven
Right here on earth to me

No man of wealth
I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied
Just knowing you love me

On the stage of life
I've played a loser's part
It seems like I've been down
Right from the very start

Every time I lift myself
Up off the ground
Something always happens
To bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world so warm and sweet
I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world

Each time you speak my name
Or put your hand in mine
The empty life I knew
I leave it far behind

'Cause you gave me the love
That I truly felt
Most of all, you made me
Believe in myself

You're more than a love to me
You're my way of life
I'll forever cherish you
More each day and night

Ah
I'm in a different world

A world that's warm, a world that's sweet
A world that's every bit complete
A world that's real, you've made me see
All the beauty surrounding me

Ah, look what you've done for me
Ah, look what you've done for me

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me

I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me
I'm in a different world
And that's where I want to be

// By The Time I Get To Phoenix //

By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be rising
She'll find the note I left hanging on her door
She'll laugh, when she reads the part that says I'm leaving
Cause I've left that girl, so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch, 
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly and call my name out low
And she'll cry, just to think, I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know,
I would really go

// Remember When //

(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new
(Don'tcha remember?)

Look at your [?] girl
Look at your face
There's too much sadness in your face
For your makeup to erase
It's in your eyes baby
The pain you feel is in your eyes
I can see it baby
And your smile is no disguise

Remember
(Do you remember when?)
When I told you not to leave
(Do you remember when?)
I tried to tell he would only make you grieve
Do you remember?
(Do you remember when?)
I told you leaving me was wrong
Now he's hurt you girl
(Do you remember when?)
He's left you standing all alone

I still remember when your love was mine
Your face was all aglow, your eyes they used to shine
Now there's sadness in your face and our love has gone to waste
The love I begged you not to take
I told you girl it was a big mistake!

(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new

Now look at what he's done to you
Look at how you've changed
There once was laughter in your eyes and now there's only pain
What happened to your smile?
Where did it go?
What has it done to you baby, how did he hurt you so?

Remember when
(Do you remember when?)
When I begged you not to leave
I tried to tell you darlin'
(Do you remember when?)
That he would only make you grieve
Remember
(Do you remember when?)
You said you found somebody new
I told you darlin'
(Do you remember when?)
That I could love no one but you

Oh my love, you know you're always welcome
To my arms, welcome to my heart
My heart is yours, yours alone
It's full of love and it's strong
Same sweet love I offered you
When you [?] that it wouldn't do!

(Do you remember?)
Ohh I know you remember darlin'!
(Remember when)
When we had a love, so sweet, so true
(Do you remember?)
(Remember when)
Until you told me you had found somebody new

Baby, baby, baby, baby come home girl
I'll take you back
(Remember when)
I still love you darlin'
(Remember when)
Everythings gonna be alright
Come on home girl
(Remember when)
I need your soul!
I need you darlin'!
(Remember when)
More than you'll ever, ever, ever know
(Don'tcha remember?)
Come home girl!

// Sunny //

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here,
My sunny one shines so sincere.
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all,
Now I feel ten feet tall.
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z.
My life was torn like a windblown sand,
Then a rock was formed when we held hands.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face.
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire,
You're my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

// Never My Love //

You ask me if there'll come a time
When I grow tired of you
Never my love
Never my love

You wonder if this heart of mine
Will lose its desire for you
Never my love
Never my love

What makes you think love will end
When you know that my whole life depends
On you  (on you)

Never my love
Never my love

You say you fear I'll change my mind
And I won't require you
Never my love
Never my love

How can you think love will end
When I've asked you to spend your whole life      
With me (with me, with me)

// Daydream Believer //

Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings of the bluebird as she sings
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise, wipe the sleep out of my eyes
My shavin' razor's cold, and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

You once thought of me, as a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy, I can be
Oh and our good time starts and end, without dollar one to spend
But how much baby do we really need

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean
To a, daydream believer
And a, homecoming queen

// Once Upon A Time //

Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine,
And said she loved me so...
But that was once upon a time...
Very long ago

Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars
And waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time,
Now the tree is gone

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed
As though tomorrow wasn't there...
We were young
And didn't have a care
Where did it go?

Once upon a time
the world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again

// The Sweetheart Tree //

They say there's a tree in the forest
A tree that will give you a sign
Come along with me to the sweetheart tree
Come and carve your name next to mine

They say if you kiss the right sweetheart
The one you've been waiting for
Big blossoms of white will burst into sight
And your love will be true evermore

// A Place In The Sun //

Like a long lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

Yes, there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)
Where there's hope for ev'ryone
(Hope for ev'ryone, hope for ev'ryone)
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
(Poor restless heart, poor restless heart, run)
I know, there's a place in the sun
(Place in the sun, place in the sun)
