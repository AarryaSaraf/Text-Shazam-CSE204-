If you could see me now,
Would my trail of tears give you a clue?
If you could see me now,
Would you remove this cup of bitter blue?

Right in the whisper's wind
I left you crying, begging please
If you could see me now,
Would you recognize me on bended knees?

Girl...
Boy, don't you know you're my everything
Without you, I'm a stranger to me

Just like a rope of sand
Our strength washed away along with love's tide
If you could see me now,
Would you see my pain exceeds my pride?

If you could see me now

Boy...
Girl, don't you know you're my everything
Without you, I'm a stranger to me

Time has balanced the books
Lines of regret embraced my days
If you could see me now,
Would you read with sorrow left its trace?

Would you forgive me
If only you could see me now
Would you return to me
If only you could see me now
Would you still love me
If only you could see me now
Would you still love me
If only you could see me now
