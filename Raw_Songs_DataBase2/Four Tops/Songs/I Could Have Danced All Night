I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have danced some more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
But all at once my heart took flight
I only know, when she began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, all night, all night

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Well all at once my heart took flight
I only know, when she began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced, all night, all night
All night, all night
