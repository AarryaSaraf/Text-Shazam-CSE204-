I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once, am I several stories high?
No, it's just on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
Any second, you may suddenly appear

The people, they stop and stare, they don't bother me
'Cause there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather be
Let them all roll by, I don't care if I
As long as I'm on the street where you live

Take me back on that street
And I'ma talkin' about that street
On that crazy street, where you live
I wanna go back on that street where you live

Yeah
But alright, ah well okay, aww nuts
Street where you live
