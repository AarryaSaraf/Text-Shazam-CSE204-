I didn't even say I wanted you, woman
I didn't even stop to think why I survived you, woman
But you walked into my life 
Like nobody's business
And you changed and re-arranged me
You turn me around
And you didn't even ask me
Hey, girl, you know you did

I didn't even think when I met you
I'll be your woman
Even only able to get through to you
Just like a woman
But I seemed so cleverly
Somehow you got to me
And now I want you with all my heart
And though I didn't want it from the start
(From the start)

I'm glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh, I'm-a glad about it
Glad about it, woman

I told you "You were wasting your time on me, woman"
And I knew about the others waiting in line
To be your woman
Yes, we were such a silly pair
Couldn't see what was there
At first, I didn't know you hanging around
But today I'm so thankful that I found
(That I found)

I'm glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh baby, I'm-a glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh yeah

Want you to be so proud of me
I want to learn about you
So glad that He looked down on me
Showed me that I cannot live without you
