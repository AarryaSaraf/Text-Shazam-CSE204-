(Ooh, (darling) your love's amazing)
(Ooh, (yeah, yeah) your love's amazing)

You made a wanderer like me
Into what I'm supposed to be
Stood beside me, right or wrong
Erased my weakness and made me strong

Gonna keep loving you my whole life through
'Cause no one ever does the things you do

Ooh wee, your love's amazing
Ooh wee, your love's amazing

With nothing to cling to, so afraid at night
Nothing for me seems to go right
Darling you stretched out your hand
And made me a better man

Gonna keep loving you my whole life through
'Cause no one ever does the things you do

Ooh, your love's amazing
Darling, ooh girl, your love sure 'nuff is amazing

Bad things about me, I know you've heard
But you never said a mumbling word
Darling, darling

Darling ooh wee, your love's amazing
Darling ooh wee, it sure 'nuff is amazing

 for love 
The things you do to me
It just make me feel good all over
Hey!
Darling, you, yeah
Your love is amazing
