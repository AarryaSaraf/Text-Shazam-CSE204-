There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it

Oh I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
Oh but after all the loves of my life (After all the loves of my life)
After all the loves, after all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one (One)

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have all the things that I desire
And my passions flow like rivers in the sky
Yeah, oh
After all the loves, after all the loves of my life
Whoa, after all the loves, the loves of my life
You're still gonna be the one
Baby, you keep wondering
Wanna know why?

MacArthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet rain, I said, flowing down
Hey, now someone left it there
Living in the rain

I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to make it
And I'll never have, never have that recipe again
Oh no
Oh, lord knows
