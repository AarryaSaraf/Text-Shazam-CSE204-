Hey, your love is wonderful
Truly wonderful
Your love must surely be
Heaven's one and only masterpiece
It's wonderful
Your love is wonderful
Your love's the sun that shines
And warm this lonely heart of mine
It's oh so bright
Your little light of love
It fills my lonely heart
Darling and it makes me see
That a man ain't a man until he's loved someone
And someone loves him like you're lovin' me

And then it's wonderful
Truly wonderful
It's an amazing thing
That taught my lonely heart to sing
It's wonderful, simply wonderful
Your loves the remedy
That has saved a lost and lonely me

I was lost, with all my bridges burned
With no where left to turn
Darling and you took me in
Thanks to you I see
There's still hope for me
And thanks to your sweet love I can feel alive again

I said it's wonderful, oh so wonderful
It's a miracle, there's just nothin' else that compares
That's right it's wonderful, so wonderful
I do declare it's wonderful, so wonderful

I was lost, with all my bridges burned
With no where left to turn
Well darling and you took me in
Thanks to you I see
That there's still hope for me
And thanks to your sweet love I can feel alive again

It's wonderful, surely wonderful
Your love must surely be
Heaven's one and only masterpiece
It's wonderful, truly wonderful
Your love is wonderful
Your love's the sun that shines
And warm this lonely heart of mine
It's wonderful surely wonderful
It's the remedy, that has saved a lost and lonely me
It's wonderful surely wonderful
I know I know it's wonderful, surely wonderful
