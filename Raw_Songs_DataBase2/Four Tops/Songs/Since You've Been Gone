Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

It's my own fault baby, that I foolishly made you cry
I know I made a mistake but remember to forgive is truly divine
Come on back into these arms of mine
Come on back and ease this hurt inside

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Being without you my love keeps me as low as a man can be
The places I know, the happy people I see
Only add to my misery
Come on back into my lonely days
Come on back with your sweet loving ways

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Don't have no future, lost it all in my past
When I lost you I lost everything i had
I know nobody ever loved me but you
Nobody cares the way you used to do
Come on back darling, please hurry
I need you, yes I do

Since you've been gone
I find it hard to carry on
Heartaches are getting stronger
And I can't hold on much longer

Darling, darling, oh
You got to come back, you got to hurry
You got to come back, you got to come back
You got to hurry, yeah yeah baby
You got to hurry, you got to come back
