Walk with me
Take my hand

(Still water)
(Still water)

Never you mind if I
Don't tell strangers passing by
If I don't brag
If I don't brag or boast
Click my glass and say a toast
About my love for you
How it runs so deep and true
And yet it's so
'Cause don't you know

Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep
Still waters run deep

Walk with me
Take my hand
Still water
Still water
(Walk with me, take my hand)
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whoa, whoa, whoa now
Still waters run deep
...
