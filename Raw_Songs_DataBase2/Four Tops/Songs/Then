If Columbus never sailed the sea,
If Longfellow never wrote a rhyme,
If leaves have never grown upon a tree,
And if the sands have never told the time,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love I feel couldn't possibly be real

If Beethoven never wrote a song,
And if Shakespeare never wrote a play,
If a man has never been wrong,
And if night has never followed day,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love for you couldn't possibly be true.

If high is low, and up is down,
And if love is not considered an emotion
(If yes is no)
If yes is no
(And square is round)
And square is round
(And if waves have never road across the ocean)
Oh-o-oh
If Michelangelo could never paint,
And if Jezebel was a saint,

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love form couldn't possibly be strong

Then I guess I don't love you,
(Like I do)
Then I guess I'll have to find me,
(Someone new)
Then I guess this love for you couldn't possibly be true
