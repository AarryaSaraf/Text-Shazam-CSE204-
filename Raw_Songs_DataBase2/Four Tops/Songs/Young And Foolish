Young and foolish
Why is it wrong to be
So very young, just a little bit foolish
Now we haven't long to be

Soon enough, the carefree days
The sunlit day roll by
And soon enough
The bluebird has to fly

Hey, we were foolish
Then one day we fell in love
Now all we do is just wonder
Just what we were thinking of

Just laughing in the sunlight
And crying in that rain
Oh I wish that we were young
And foolish again

But it's too late now
And foolish again
How can you forget?
And foolish again
