Darling, darling
Although you're gone my love still lingers on
Although I miss you
I can no longer kiss you, 'cause for you belong to him

Darling, my darling
When I'm lonely I softly hum our song
I hum the part that says, "to me, you'll always belong"
Mhmm mhmm

And sometimes when I forget you're gone away
I remember as I softly hum the part that says
That you'll always be by my side to stay
I always wanted it that way

And darling, my darling
One day one day I hope I'll find
By a love that's true
Someone who'll love me too

Then I won't have to hum when I'm lonely
Hum when I miss you
And the part that says, "you'll love me only"
That's the part I like the best

Hum when I'm lonely
Hum when I miss you
And the part that says, "you'll love me only"
That's the part I like the best
