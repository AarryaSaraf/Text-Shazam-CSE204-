Love has gone, love has gone

Love has gone
And left me in misery
Love has gone
No more joy will there be for me

A hollow man, leaving me a helpless man
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
No more peace shall I find
Love has gone
Leaving heartaches behind, oh yeah

When I lost that little girl
I lost sight of the world
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
There's nothing left for me
Love has gone
Love is gone, I'm not what I used to be

I've been robbed of happiness
I'm no good, I must confess
I can't pretend my love is at an end
'Cause my love is gone

Love has gone
Love has gone
Love has gone
Love has gone
