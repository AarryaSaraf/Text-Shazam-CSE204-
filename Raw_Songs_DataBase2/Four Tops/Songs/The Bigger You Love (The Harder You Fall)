When you love someone dear,
They can do no wrong
But when you love too hard, girl
You sing a different song
You got to take your time and build only slow
And get it all together, child, and watch it grow

The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly

You gotta start a love right from the ground
'Cause when you start from the top, girl
You can only come down
And when you give all your love and get no return
That's the hurting way you have to try to learn

The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly
The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly
