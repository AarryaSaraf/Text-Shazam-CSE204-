105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
359, had seven shots
Uber driver just kicked us out
Sun is up but we won't stop
100 miles an hour, going nowhere

On the road now, pull my phone out
I just met these girls, these my hoes now
Not gonna slow now, on a roll now
Miley dancing with me, we on the floor now
We so high now, it 'bout 5 now
At this point I might be high enough to drive now
Having fun now, tipping wines out
It's getting lit, freaky side about to come out

Couldn't be lit if you remember it in the morning
When you're looking like this, know you're gonna get into something

105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
359, had seven shots
Uber driver just kicked us out
Sun is up but we won't stop
100 miles an hour, going nowhere

Tell me who's this in the bed right now?
Tell me how did I get here right now? Ah
Wait until my best friend find out
We wasn't talking but he used this, ah
I'm out here looking like the lotto, yeah
Feeling like a fucking model, yeah
I ain't worried 'bout tomorrow, yeah
Drinking straight out of the bottle

Couldn't be lit if you remember it in the morning
When you're looking like this, know you're gonna get into something

105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
