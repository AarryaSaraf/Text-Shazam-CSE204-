The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't

Even do a sound and there is
No time, catch a breath and when it
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna getting love

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Have we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

And change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

I was going when on
And running on and on
And it will never stop
I wish will never stop
There's no time to breathe
Go back and fall asleep
It's running on and on
Time
(Time)

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

Running, running on and on, it's running on and on
And it will never stop, it will never stop
The time, more time, more time, more time
Oh, oh
