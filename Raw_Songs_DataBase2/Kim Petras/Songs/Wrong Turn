You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You met the wrong one, met the wrong one, on the wrong night
Yeah, you took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time

Never should've came alone
Never gonna make it home
Nothing matters anymore
Go ahead and lock the door
You're my bloody valentine
You can't hide behind the blinds
Hurry, quick, you're out of time
Out of time

It's your final destination
Count your blessings
Time to make a sacrifice
Take a deep breath
Let it sink in
Now you realize

You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You met the wrong one, met the wrong one, on the wrong night
Yeah, you took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time

Follow flames, bloody bones
Whips and chains, heart to stone
I am who you really fear
Hold your tears, save the press
Demons, bottles, crucified
You and death come eye to eye
Go and kiss your life goodbye
Kiss your life goodbye

It's your final destination
Count your blessings
Time to make a sacrifice
Take a deep breath
Let it sink in
Now you realize

You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
You took the wrong turn, took the wrong turn, at the wrong time
