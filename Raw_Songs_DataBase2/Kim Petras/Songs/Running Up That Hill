It doesn't hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You don't want to hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (E-yo)
Say, if I only could, ooh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

Oh, come on, baby (Ye-yeah)
Oh, come on, darling (E-yo)
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Yeah, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Yeah, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Yeah, if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, be running up that road
If I only could, be running up that road
