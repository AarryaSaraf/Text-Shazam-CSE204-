Who are you

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

Blood on the floor, glamour and gauze
Stain on the glass, make this the last night that you're here
Bites on your neck, can't dodge a hex
Show me respect, I see the death, I smell the fear
Don't be afraid, just take my hand
Come follow me, I promise that I'll take you there
Just you and me, can't even breath
Can't hear your scream (La, la la la, la, la la la)

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

One taste of blood is not enough to satisfy
Take your last breath and get a rush, gotta die to feel alive
Sweet evil come deliver us the sacrifice
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, gotta die to feel alive

Dawn of the dead, blood ruby red
Don't lose your head, love when you beg, love when you cry
Queen of the Damned, that what I am
Reborn again, I never end, I never die
Don't let me in, I see the sin
Under your skin, you can't escape, you can't deny
Seek and I find, nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide (La la la la, la la la la)

It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre
It's gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre, gonna be a massacre

One taste of blood is not enough to satisfy
Take your last breath and get a rush, gotta die to feel alive
Sweet evil come deliver us the sacrifice
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, gotta die to feel alive
