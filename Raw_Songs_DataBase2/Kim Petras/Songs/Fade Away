Lost it all
In my friends had hope
I try to stop stop stop
But it never ever was enough
I try to get him back
But now I see
It's that it's too late late late
I watched him fade
I didn't want it
I didn't need it
Yet repeat it
Tell me how to be reworked this
I didn't see it
I wouldn't leave it
Why did I get you
Tell me how I lost it

Tell me how I got you
Tell me what was wrong
Tell me exactly what I've done
Whatever happen to everything I wanted
What happen to my dreams now are hunted
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
Tell me about everything all night
Tell me what happen to everything I wanted
What happen to my dreams now they are all hunted
Yeah

I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away

Lost it all

Yeah

I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away
I watched him fade away

I watched it all go away
Until I really got to see
I lost it all on my way
Can't it come back to my?
I wanna get back to where
Everything with us is ok
I watched it all fade away
Fade away, I watched him fade away

Tell me how I got you
Tell me what was wrong
Tell me exactly what I've done
Whatever happen to everything I wanted
What happen to my dreams now are hunted
Tell me what I needed
Tell me what was right
