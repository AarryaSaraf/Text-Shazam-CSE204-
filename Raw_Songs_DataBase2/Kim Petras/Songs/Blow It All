Eeeh...

Feel like I may be waiting all my life
Everybody rollin' tryna feel alive
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight

Shorty in the bathroom and she askin' where the coke at
I spent 20,000 just to leave it on the coat rack
Pull up, got his number and he wrote it on a notepad
Now that's a throwback, yeah
Shining like I came out off the ceiling of a reef pack
And if you ain't single, baby, know I'm tryna change that
But you know my name just like I came up with a name tag
'Cause I'm a name brand

Tonight, we got this, we gon' be alright (Alright, alright)
Gon' be alright
Tonight, we live like we're not gonna die (We're not gonna die)
I'm not gon' die

Feel like I may be waiting all my life
Everybody rollin' tryna feel alive
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight

You got money on your mind (You should go and make it)
I got a big of what's behind (You should go and shake it)
These designers keep me fly (Like I'm on a spaceship)
Got me  like a flip (Keep the Gucci on my lip)
Party life, yeah, we go worldwide (Woah, woah)
Hands high, like we turn and touch the sky (Woah, woah)
Baby, do it, you ain't even gotta try (Oh, no)
Livin' life, don't kill the vibe

Tonight, we got this, we gon' be alright
Yeah, we live like we're never gonna die, never die, yeah!

Feel like I may be waiting all my life
Everybody rollin' tryna feel alive
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
Cup full of liquor, got the key to life
Came from the bottom, now my money right
Can't take it with you, blow it all tonight
All tonight, blow it all tonight
