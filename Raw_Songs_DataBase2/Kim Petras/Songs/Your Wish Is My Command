Your wish is my command
Baby, I can take it
Baby, I can take it
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it
Baby, I can do it

Ooh, Daddy, yeah
Pull my hair
Ooh, take control
Take my soul
Ooh, fuck me up
Take the top
Ooh, feel the pain
Say my name
Ooh, do it again
Do it again and do it again
And do it again and do it again

I don't want another baby
Want a man to take control all night
Can you push me to the limit?
Can you take me to the finish line?

Your wish is my command
Baby, I can take it
Baby, I can take it
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it
Baby, I can do it

Ooh, yeah
Daddy, you got permission
Ooh, yeah
Put me into position
Ooh, yeah
Come on, teach me a lesson
Ooh, yeah
I can be your possession

I don't want another baby
Want a man to take control all night
Can you push me to the limit?
Can you take me to the finish line?

Your wish is my command
Baby, I can take it
Baby, I can take it
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it
Baby, I can do it

Your wish is my command
Baby, I can take it
Baby, I can take it
Your wish is my command
Baby, I can do it
Baby, I can do it
