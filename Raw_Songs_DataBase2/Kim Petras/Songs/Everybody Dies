Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies

Mama's gonna get a call one day
That her baby's dead and gone away
I been knocking on Heaven's door
Since the day that I was born
Yeah, since a young girl
Always knew that I was trouble
Livin' like a loaded pistol
'Cause when you're gone is when they miss ya

So I'm gon' rebel until the end
And when I go down, I'ma see you in Hell
You can't scare me, I'm prepared
So give me all my roses while I'm here

Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies (Everybody dies)


So scatter all my ashes in the sea
Promise me that you'll remember me
Never was who I was supposed to be
But I never gave apologies, no
Where I lay these 'Lenciagas is my home
I'm a rollin' stone

So I'm gon' rebel (Rebel) until the end (The end)
And when I go down, I'ma see you in Hell (See you in Hell)
You can't scare me, I'm prepared
So give me all my roses while I'm here

Not everybody fears
But everybody cries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies
Not everybody wins
But everybody tries
Not everybody lives
But everybody dies (Everybody dies)
