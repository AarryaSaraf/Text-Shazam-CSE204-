They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'

Why they always want my time
Yeah like we can rewind
And I ain't gonna lie
I'm faded out my mind
Faded every night
I can touch the sky
I be too faded to drive
Every night I wanna fly
Cause it's all about us
Spend some money live it up
They never saw when it was rough
Drop the top and roll the windows up

They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'

Stay faded every night
Faded everyday
That's the only way
That's the only way
In and out of different places
But I can't see their faces
They wanna love me cause I'm famous
Can't nobody blame us, no
And this is all about us
Spend some money, live it up
They never saw when it was rough
Drop the top and roll the windows up

They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'


Yeah, I stay faded only smoking A-graded
Everybody fake as fuck so I been self medicatin'
I'm the greatest that there was and still the most underrated
That shit ain't up for discussion or debatin'
Still I gotta get fucked up to have a good time
If there's something in my cup then it's a good night
I'm hittin' up the plug, tell 'em I'ma double up
I'ma need a couple blunts, make 'em double-stuffed


They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
