You got your hands up, got the bands up
Got your head held high like you're starstruck
You a boss, you know how to run a bag up
You know you gon' win the race, tell 'em catch up
Trail-blazing, don't it feel amazing?
Knowing that you're the rose growing out the pavement
After everything said and done, you done made it
You never stop, I know that's why they hating
And, um, shout out to all the real ones
With the bases loaded, bunch of home runs
If the outcome is more income
Then adjust your crown, job well done
