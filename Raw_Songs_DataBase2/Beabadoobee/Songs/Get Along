Tell me the things you let me know
No need to rush we'll take it slowly
Guess, our worlds colliding
The difference in us is hard to prove
Guess I just have to get to know you
But, I'll take my time trying

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

Spending all of our time figuring what to do
Not to far there's a place just for us two
Its an endless world that's outside so I'm sticking with you
Guess it's fine in our minds there's enough to do

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

In a place not far from home
Somewhere we both go
In our way we can't relay
In the end we're just the same

I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
