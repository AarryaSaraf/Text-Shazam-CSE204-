I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared, oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you

I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
