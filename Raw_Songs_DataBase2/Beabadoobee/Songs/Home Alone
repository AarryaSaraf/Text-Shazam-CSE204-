I'm awake
Can you see me now
And if you stay
We can lounge about
And I'm getting tired
But you make me feel awake
And at the end of the night
Maybe we can stay up late

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

On my own
I miss you here
Sun is gone
And the clouds are near
And I'm getting tired of being
By myself
'Cause at the end of the night
Maybe you can help yourself

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind
