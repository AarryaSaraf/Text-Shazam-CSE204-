I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

Corbyn, my best friend
Taught me everything I know in my head, and he's
Braindead in the tool shed
Didn't hear a single word you said

I must apologize
Say it one more time mister magpie
Goodbye cool guy
Laugh again, you're gonna get a bruised eye
What's your problem
With me?
Something's gone wrong
What the hell is happening?

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

This could be forever
Is that too much to ask?
We'll try and make it last
One day more
We could be together
Hang out in the day
But then you'll eat my brain
So whatever

In my jeans
This ice cream is for everyone
And I want you to be the one
In my dreams
I run around the world sometime
Then I'll take you back to mine

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

In my rocky beep beep

I'm vindicated
You're saturated
Will you stop taking it?
Just a wannabe, beep beep
I dream this dream
I can't explain it
And I just shave my head
Goodbye honeybee, beep beep

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

What's your problem with me?
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song
