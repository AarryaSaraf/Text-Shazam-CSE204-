Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Who's laughing now?
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now?

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Further away
Further away
Further away
