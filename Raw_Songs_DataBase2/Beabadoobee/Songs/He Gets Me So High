He pretends, he is my closest friend
It's a lie, when he cries
We'll uncloak his disguise
He's a kick on my side
And I wish that I'm your ride

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

He gets fed and lives under my bed
It's been said, that it's all just in my head
(Are you feeling alive?)
I'll come back when I meet you
(Just pretend I'll be fine)
I need to know that I want you
(You need reflecting of mind)
When you know that I
I always end up coming back to you

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
So high

He gets me so high
