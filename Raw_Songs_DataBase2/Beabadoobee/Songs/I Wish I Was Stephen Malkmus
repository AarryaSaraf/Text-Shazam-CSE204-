Think I'm starting to change
With the weeks and the days
Got this new blue-haired phase

I think I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Guess I'm tryna get by
'Cause like the weather, I change with time

And I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Now I've changed, I've been feeling comfy
But now I've changed, I've been feeling lonely
'Cause your photos suck, your brand is shit
You're up your butt
You never really ask me how I am, ask me how I am

'Cause I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Nice

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Fuck
