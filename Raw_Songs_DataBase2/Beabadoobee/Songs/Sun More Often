Keep your head down low
Cause is it the sound, or is it the way things go?
In your head you're scared
So just sing along to the song in end

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

If you tried you'll see
That the world's not as scary as it seems

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
