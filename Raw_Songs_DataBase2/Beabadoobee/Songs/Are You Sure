You say you understand
Are you sure, are you sure?
You say you've been to Mars before
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

You think you know my brain
Are you sure, are you sure?
You think you know just what to say
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

So talk to me again
You seem to understand
You claim to say its fine
But you never really know where I am
Why
Why
Why
Why

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands
