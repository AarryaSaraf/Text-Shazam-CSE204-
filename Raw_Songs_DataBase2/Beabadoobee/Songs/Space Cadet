Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our fears, they're all gone

Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sitting tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

So quit being so negative
It's fine don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone
