Know it's been raining, I swear, I'm not lonely
Always complaining that you never see me
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

Don't know why I feel this way
Treating all my friends the same
Haven't had enough to do
But I'm not ignoring you
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend
