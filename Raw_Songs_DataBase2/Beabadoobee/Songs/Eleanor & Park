The morning bus rides
Your face makes me want to smile
Park, wait for me outside
So you can see what's inside my mind
I'll bring you comics to make you laugh
On days where you feel kinda sad
I want you to feel adored
Oh my god I love your voice
Take me in your arms now baby
Hold me like you'll never leave me
I know you don't have it easy
You'll get through it if you're with me
Eleanor, are you feeling cold
No hesitation I'll give you my coat
You're so sweet I'll let you know
You're the type of guy to never let go
I don't wanna go back home
I don't wanna want you to be on your own
Take me in your arms now baby
Hold me like you'll never leave me
I know you don't have it easy
You'll get through it if you're with me
