Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pot
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date?
