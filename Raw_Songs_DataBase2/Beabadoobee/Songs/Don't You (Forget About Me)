Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Oooh...

Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down

Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't

As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?

Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't

La la la...

As you walk on by (Don't you forget about me)
Will you call my name? (Don't don't don't don't)
As you walk on by (Don't you forget about me) 
Will you call my name? (Don't don't don't don't)
