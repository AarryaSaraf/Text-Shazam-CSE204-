Crash the car again
The same mistakes again
Don't wanna hurt you like I did

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

All alone again
It hurts my heart again
I think my blood is running thin

I'm away again
It hurts my head again
Don't wanna be away from your skin

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

Guess that's how my life will go
At least we're together though
Together though
Together though
Together though

Hurt myself again
I thought you'd notice it
Don't wanna fix it like you did

'Cause I don't want to let you know
I've been thinking of letting you go
Guess that's how the story ends
At least we're together again
Together again
Together again
Together again

Fine I'm okay by myself
I'm doing great
But we'd be better together
Better together
Together though
Together though
Together again
