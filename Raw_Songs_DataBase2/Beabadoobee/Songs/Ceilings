Love me like a garden filled with flowers
Like the driest desert in the rain
Love me like cigarettes in Paris
Love me like a book that has no name

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

Miss me like the scent of your first room
The thing you've always wanted to go back to
Ceilings were so high when you were five
Miss me like the way your mother misses your height

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live
