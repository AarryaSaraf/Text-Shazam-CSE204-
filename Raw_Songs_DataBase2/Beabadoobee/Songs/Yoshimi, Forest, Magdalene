He-, hold up, fuck
He-, what the fuck?
Sounds like a fart
(One, two, three, four)

He smells very nice
Oh so nice
Wears clothes that I like
He doesn't even try
He doesn't even try

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Loves me till I die
I'll be his corpse bride
And when I smell he says it's fine
Oh how nice

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

I'm scared he's gonna leave me
'Cause when I'm mad I get pretty scary
But he won't and he won't because I'm pretty
And we'll have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
Of babies

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
