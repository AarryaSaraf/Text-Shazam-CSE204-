Am I seductive?
Call me back in an hour
If you wanna go back home
Oh babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Am I attractive?
Tell me, am I good enough?
Lately I've been on and off
I think I've heard too much, my wrists are numb
Heard too much, my limbs are numb

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

You're in my head
You're in my head
Fuck

I'm so attractive
Think I'm going to explode
Baby, I've been hung around
Won't you just drop your shit and pick up the phone?
Drop your shit and pick up the phone

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about
