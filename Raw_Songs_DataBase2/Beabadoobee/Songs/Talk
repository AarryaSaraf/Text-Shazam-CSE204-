Call you up on a Tuesday
Say "What's up"
Babe it's too late
Why'd you have to be so complicated
Complicated

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

A crowded place
Waiting for you
Am I lost why can't I find you
A silhouette that's in my head
You don't exist
You're my imagination
You don't exist
You're just a bad decision

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday
