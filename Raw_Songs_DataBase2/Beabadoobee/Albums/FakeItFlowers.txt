// Care //

It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to co-operate
I need some help to forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
Because you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

It's been a while since I've thought about it
Maybe it's time to communicate
I was seven to think about it
The fact I still can't forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Forget about it

I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You, you-ou

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you?

// Worth It //

Your eyes are just like his but your face is a bit different
You're a bit more fucked but I guess that's fine
Maybe, that's what I want this time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

This is too bad to boast
But this is my way to float
And if I shut up I'm scared I'll drown
But maybe that's the best for now

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Don't think this is worth it
Don't think this is worth it
I'm not wasting time
But you've been on my mind
Don't think this is worth it
This time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

// Dye It Red //

Kiss my ass, you don't know jack
And if you say you understand you don't
You don't
You don't
You don't

Fuck me, only when I'm keen
Not according to your beer
Your beer
Your beer
Your beer

So let me be what I've wanted to be

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping now

Touch me as if you mean it
Because I'm getting tired of being all alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

And if it's not for you guess I'll find it on my own

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

And maybe it's time to change my ways
But that doesn't include you

Let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

That cute
That cute
That cute

// Back To Mars //

Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more?
Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before?
Doesn't matter if sometimes we cannot stick to being friends
Doesn't matter if we break up just to act all fine again

Take me to the South of France where we could just be old friends
We'd go to the beach and you could braid my hair
You could braid my hair

// Charlie Brown //

Back on old habits
That no one knows about
Too bad that Charlie Brown
Has inked you up to slow you down
Has inked you up to slow you down

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

I call you if I need you
Give my brain a sec
I just need to figure things out
Figure things out

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

If I could die here a million times
Then what's the point of trying?

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

// Emo Song //

Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

You call me up and lie again
Like all the men I use to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost my self in cosmic dust

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

// Sorry //

Sad I had to see you
But I don't and I won't and I won't
To think I was just like you
All alone skin to bone, skin to bone

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I hope to come and see you
When your state's doing great, doing great
A part of me feels for you
That I'm doing alright and guess I've been feeling fine

But it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I never want to think twice
With what could have been your life

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

// Further Away //

Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Who's laughing now?
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now?

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Further away
Further away
Further away

// Horen Sarrison //

You are the smell of pavement after the rain
You are the last empty seat on a train
And I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

You are the song that I need for my mental state
You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late
So I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

And I want to keep you quiet
And I know you feel the same
And I'm sorry I'm gone so often
But I know you'd do the same
The same
The same

I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love

// How Was Your Day? //

How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Forgotten how you used to smile

What do you look like?
Remember when we used to fight?

And I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

Call me up late
Say it's okay
'Cause I'll be away a while
I can't remember your smile

You used to kiss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

'Cause even when we're miles away I know
You'll still want me as usual

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Remember when we used to smile
You used to miss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That things have to change like the weather and the days

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

// Together //

Crash the car again
The same mistakes again
Don't wanna hurt you like I did

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

All alone again
It hurts my heart again
I think my blood is running thin

I'm away again
It hurts my head again
Don't wanna be away from your skin

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

Guess that's how my life will go
At least we're together though
Together though
Together though
Together though

Hurt myself again
I thought you'd notice it
Don't wanna fix it like you did

'Cause I don't want to let you know
I've been thinking of letting you go
Guess that's how the story ends
At least we're together again
Together again
Together again
Together again

Fine I'm okay by myself
I'm doing great
But we'd be better together
Better together
Together though
Together though
Together again

// Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene //

He-, hold up, fuck
He-, what the fuck?
Sounds like a fart
(One, two, three, four)

He smells very nice
Oh so nice
Wears clothes that I like
He doesn't even try
He doesn't even try

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Loves me till I die
I'll be his corpse bride
And when I smell he says it's fine
Oh how nice

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

I'm scared he's gonna leave me
'Cause when I'm mad I get pretty scary
But he won't and he won't because I'm pretty
And we'll have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
Of babies

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

// First Date //

Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pot
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date?
