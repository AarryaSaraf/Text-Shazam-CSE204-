Album: PatchedUp

// Everest //

You're alright, you're still breathing
Even though you feel dead sometimes
You'll be fine, you're still eating
Even though it doesn't last sometimes

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Blank noise is an awful sound
And it hurts my ears, I don't know how
My name's just a silhouette
Hiding under all the self-doubt

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared

// Tired //

You haven't been good for long
Is it the sound of your own thoughts
That always keeps you up at night?
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
'Cause I'm getting pretty fucking tired

You haven't felt right for days
Is it the fact you never say
What comes in your mind that day?
Maybe it's time to shut away
'Cause I've never really felt okay

'Cause I've been eating less all day
To give my brain some extra space to think
'Bout all the things to do to help
Distract me from the rude of heart

// Dance With Me //

If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right?

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don't have to speak

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

// Art Class //

You look pretty good today
Is it me or did you shave?
Good, you've been looking at me twice as more
So I can see your face
You sit across from me, in the classroom
But do you even know my name?
If you want to ask me how I am
Don't hesitate

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

Why do you always stick to smiling
And sit still being so quiet?
I've been pretty distracted for some days
And it's ruining my diet
If you don't take the hint already
I'm afraid I'll start a riot
'Cause you make my whole world go crazy
Yeah your smell just sends me flying

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

All my days
Been trying to find a reason to stay
Say my name
And I'll go ahead and pick a date
I'm okay
If you understand that this is fate

Art class
Art class
Art class
Art class

// If You Want To //

If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to

If you wanted to
If you try to

Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started, take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

If you wanted to
If you try to

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

// Eighteen //

Don't wanna be eighteen with responsibilities
Sometimes I get scared of growing up
Entering a world with broken dreams
Sometimes I get scared and throw it all up

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen when I can't ride a bike
Still hang onto my sheets during storms
In my bed I'm ten but I can't shut my eyes
I still wish I wore a school uniform

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen with a messy room
Still wonder what lingers under my bed at night
Kinda wish I stayed at my mother's home
Are we gonna know what it's like to be blind?

'Cause June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

// The Way I Spoke //

Think I saw you on the bus just yesterday
Wearing that blue shirt you said you liked that day
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you held my hand?
We were by a station
The sky was dark in sight
The moon was out but the sun was in your eyes
No one talked but I did
You listened
You said you liked the way I spoke

I think I saw you in my dream last night
It was cold with lots of pretty lights
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you kissed me?
We were by an archway
With flowers cascading round the roof
Standing under my winter coat to shelter us
You said you liked the way I spoke

And if you'd like to hold my hand
It would bring back all the things we had
And if God were to take that all away
Wouldn't that be a shame?
