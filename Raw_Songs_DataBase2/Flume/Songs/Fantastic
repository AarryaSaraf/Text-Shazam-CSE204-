Life is wrapped up in plastics, classics
Fucking fantastic
Television show a sitcom classic
Fuzzy screen static

Bad milk got my raisin bran tasting bad
Getting fiber-tastic
Say you'll go, say you're someone imagined
Life's looking tragic

Think Finn is the raddest; Jake, his is passed it
Little yellow bastard
Come get another boyfriend, number ten
What a romantic

Take a bite, it's relaxing, hands crack
Heart is full on acid
Jenny bitching bout her ex again, making me
Melodramatics

Need a hit, need to sit, need to get away
Intergalactic
Warmth fast be escaping me
Left in the attic

Once stoned, I'm down the hole again
It's automatic
Mama says I should get a date, lose weight
Fucking fantastic
