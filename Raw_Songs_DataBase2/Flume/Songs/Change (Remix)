Everybody, everybody...

You left for work 
but I'm still thinking bout your touch. 
I see that, I kiss that, I flip that. 
Why'd you have to go? 
Your skin just like gasses in that roll up video. 
I see that, I want that. 
If you feel me let me know.

If you and me can be for real. 
Your touch, I need your love again,
and again, and again, and again...

Baby girl how your kisses so sweet? 
Let them want what they want, 
don't mean a thing to me 
cause everybody envies your touch. 

We're walking and your holding my hand. 
Yeah, that right there, 
now I can understand why everybody envies your touch.
