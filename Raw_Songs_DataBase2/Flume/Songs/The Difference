The difference in between
All the faces you read
When the grass ain't green
When you fix everything

I don't know about you
But I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Who cares about a game
When it's all been replaced
Each level feels the same
It really goes either way

I don't know about you
But I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold on
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
