Pick myself up off the ground
Tired of hearing the sound
Of the hands of the clock go round
Misery come down
Think they have been here for days
Scared but I'm not afraid
I'm just parting, trying to find an escape
Picking the lock on the cage

Where've you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know?
If I'm okay, I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay? I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell

Do you know how it felt?
A question that I answer myself
I'm standing here in amazement
You really showed me yourself
Making it hard to engage (Mm, mm)
There's nothing left to say (Mm, mm)
Instances that you can't erase
Wasting away
Wide awake

Where've you been?
Where did you go, go?
How can you sleep knowing you don't know?
If I'm okay, I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell (Woah)
You put up walls knowing I can't see
How can you die knowing I can't breathe?
Am I okay? I hope I'm not
If you care, I can't tell
