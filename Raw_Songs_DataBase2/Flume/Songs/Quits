Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah
Don't you know that kills me inside
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

I had to get it off the chest
Damn you make a nigga stressed
I hardly gotta flex but when I do I know you feel that
Change my bitch like a season
Cut her off I delete her
All smiles Mona Lisa
She give me too many reasons
How you do me like that
How you turn your back
I'ma pack these bags
I don't want you back

Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah (We were)
Oh how that killed me inside (It did, it did)
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

You done went and made a mess
Heisman with the step
Tried to catch me slippin'
Had to swerve that shit (Yeah)
Always gave you respect
You ain't give that back
Now she wanna make amends
And I don't want that

Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah
Oh how that killed me inside
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow one time

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

Ca-callin quits
Ca-callin quits
I'm callin quits
I'm done with this
I'm done with this
Ca-callin quits
Ca-callin quits
I'm callin quits
I'm done with this
