Make your decisions now
Weigh it up
Facing a long road down or
Keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice, won't make it right
Head up in your desires, but

Maybe you're looking for different way
'Cause I know when you act like this
That you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it, but you won't admit it
You're numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Not gonna tell you stop, ease it up
Hold your emotions back, stop taking it out on her
I'm gonna lose no pride, giving up
We're going on lockdown

But maybe you're looking for a different way
'Cause I know when you act like this
That you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it, but you won't admit it
You're numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

If I feel like losing my mind
We're in too deep
But feelings often we leave behind
I'm too weak from this
Slow down, take a second, refine
And trust your instincts
Broken down to one thing, survive
So primitively

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
