Now I got you on my side
We could start an empire
You, me and the skyline
Riding on a beam light
Lift me till I'm up high
Time fly and I glide by
Real life highlight
Now we're dancing on a fine line

And you make me wanna look twice
To see divine in my life
Yeah, there's crystals on the front line
And I trust you with my whole life
And you make me wanna look twice
To see what's on the inside
There's a halo under your eyes

Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night
Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night

But when I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I've got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice

Now my light is amplified
See, I got you on the good side
Love be my guide
Flying through the divide
And you make me wanna look twice
To see divine in my life
Yeah, there's crystals on the front line
And I trust you with my whole life
And you make me wanna look twice
To see what's on the inside
There's a halo under your eyes

Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night
Wherever you may go
Part of me follows
Bound by no ropes and ties
I got you for one night

But when I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

I've got some feelings of fire
I've got some sense of desire
Feelin' a light just in light of
The fact that we are alive
And I'm on my way
Changing up lanes
Fly through the gates
Money's on me
I see you're real
I see your fear
I see you clear

When I am hollow
And I miss you and I feel like
I've got no level
And I miss you and I feel like

Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice
Look twice, look twice, look twice, look twice
