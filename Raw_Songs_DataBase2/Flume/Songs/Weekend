Our love, was a weekend on the water
Silly me, for thinking you would want me longer
My love, found a home under the water
Glory be, 'tis the season for a slaughter

Girls will never know what they want, there's no sorrow now
Was it all a mistake, or are you sorry right now
If I had it all my way, I'd be with you right now
Haunted by a memory, yes I'm with you right now
