Pressure on me
Put that on me, you did
Build up slowly
Explode on ya, I did (I did)

Fed me lies, you're a snake
Yes, I meant that (I did)
Fed me lies yes, you did
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Do no talking
Do not call me (Holla)
Hit your heartstrings
Like I'm Rocky (I did)

Fed me lies, you're a snake
Yes, I meant that (I did)
Fed me lies yes, you did
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be you friend)
No, I don't want that shit
(No, I don't want that shit)
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
