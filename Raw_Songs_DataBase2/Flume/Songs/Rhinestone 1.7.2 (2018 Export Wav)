Why don't I go back to my thing?
This relationship, I'm asking
For your undivided attention
Trust in all that we started

Chex Mix and blue cheese
What you wanna 
You are like a rhinestone
Just try to stay alive

Thought that I should let you know

I'm blushin', I'm still in love (Real love, real love)
More than in love
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on
I'm blushin', I'm waitin' up (Real love, real love)
Until you come
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on

Pick me up some time in the morning
Still before the sun is dawning
Moonflower, call me your moonflower
Treat me kind, I'll bloom forever

Chex Mix and blue cheese
What you wanna 
You are like a rhinestone
Just try to stay alive

Thought that I should let you know

I'm blushin', I'm still in love (Real love, real love)
More than in love
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on
I'm blushin', I'm waitin' up (Real love, real love)
Until you come
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on

How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
(Real love, real love)
(Real love, real love)
