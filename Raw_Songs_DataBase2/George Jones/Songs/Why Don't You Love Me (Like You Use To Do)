Well, Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe?
My hair's still curly, my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Can't have no lovin' like a huggin' 
And a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get near or further 
Or closer than a country mile.

Why don't you spark me like you used to do?
And say sweet nothin' like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?

Well, Why don't you be just like you used to be?
How come you find so many faults with me
Somebody changed, so let me give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?

Can't have no lovin' like a huggin' 
And a kissin' in a long, long while
We don't get near or further 
Or closer than a country mile.

Why don't you say the things you used to say?
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?..
