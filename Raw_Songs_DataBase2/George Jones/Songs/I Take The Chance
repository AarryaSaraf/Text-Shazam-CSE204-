I'll take the chance
To lose my soul, my life, my pride
I'll take the chance
To be with you.

I tried to live
My life the best I can
I prayed I'd never cheat
To heed
My hearts command

But did you know
You are my tried and true?
I wonder if you think
I'd do the same by you

I'll take the chance
Of causing you to doubt my love
I'll take the chance
To be with you.

I know it's wrong
For us to
And when you hold me in
Your arms I can't resist.

I have a home
And some one tried and true
I know I'll lose it all
If I would dream of you.

I'll take the chance
To lose my soul, my life, my pride
I'll take the chance
To be with you...
