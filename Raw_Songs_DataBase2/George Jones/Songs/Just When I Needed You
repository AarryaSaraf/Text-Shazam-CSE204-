Just when I needed you, you left and went away,
You made my life so blue both night and day,
You left me here behind, with a troubled, worried mind,
So broken hearted too, just when I needed you.

I cried, I cried, I prayed, I tried 
To forget you and never call your name, 
What a shame, what a shame
You're the one that was to blame
You're the one that proved untrue, 
Just when I needed you.

You said, it's best we part, and never love again,
And though it broke my heart, I won't complain,
You know I love you still, and dear, I always will,
Although you proved untrue, just when I needed you.

I cried, I cried, I prayed, and I tried 
To forget you and never call your name, 
What a shame, what a shame
You're the one that was to blame
You're the one that proved untrue, 
Just when I needed you...
