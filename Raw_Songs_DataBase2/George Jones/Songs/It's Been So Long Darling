It's been so long darling since I had to go away
It's been so long darling and I can't forget that day
Although you never mentioned it you cried that whole day long
It's been so long darling but now I'm coming home.

It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling do you really realize
That got the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darling since I had a kiss from you.

It's been such a long time darling but it won't be long now
It's been so long darling but I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waiting as you did in days gone by
It's been such a long time darling please don't blame me if I cry...
