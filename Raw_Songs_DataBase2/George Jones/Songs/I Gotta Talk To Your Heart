I've gotta talk to your heart
You have no right to make me cry
The love I've shone for you these years
Can't be washed away with tears
I've gotta talk to your heart.

I've gotta make you understand
Our love is drifting far apart
Won't you please stop where you are
Let's not carry this too far
I've gotta talk to your heart.

Who'd told you all those lies
That brought tears to your eyes
You know this never could be
So before you say goodbye
Give me another try
And I'll prove they're wrong you'll see.

I've gotta talk to your heart
Just gotta make you understand
I've gotta try to change your mind
Give me just a little time
I've gotta talk to your heart.

Who'd told you all those lies
That brought tears to your eyes
You know this never could be
So before you say goodbye
Give me another try
And I'll prove they're wrong you'll see.

I've gotta talk to your heart
Just gotta make you understand
I've gotta try to change your mind
Give me just a little time
I've gotta talk to your heart.
