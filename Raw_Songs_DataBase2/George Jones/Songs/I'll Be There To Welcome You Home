I remember my childhood my mother said son
Prepare to me Jesus when your work here is done
When I die just remember my soul will live on
I'll be there to meet you and welcome you home
I'll meet you in heaven some wonderful day
When the dark stormy clouds of life roll away
When your life here is over in this world of sin
I'll be there to meet you and welcome you in
When the cold hand of death comes and takes you away
Be ready to meet Jesus be ready today
Don't put it off as time passes on
Be ready to meet Jesus we'll welcome you home
I'll meet you in heaven...
