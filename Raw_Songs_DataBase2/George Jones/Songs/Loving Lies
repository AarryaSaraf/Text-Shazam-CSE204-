I'll never understand dear as long as I live
I guess I will always wonder why
You told me that you loved me straight from your heart
And then without a warning said goodbye

Loving lies that I believed and now how I grieve
You didn't mean them from the start
But you told me loving lies and broke my heart

You say I'll soon forget you and find somebody new
But darling oh how wrong you are
I've only had one love dear and it was for you
And from that love my heart will bear a scar

Loving lies that I believed...
