You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart and I know
That I love you and I always will.

I've had some sweethearts and dear so have you
And I've done somethings I know I shouldn't do
We tasted life both the bitter and the sweet
It helps us to know love when we get to meet.

You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart and I know
That I love you and I always will.

We pay for our future with the tears from the past
It helps us know when we've found love at last
I didn't know what joy was till I've been through
I didn't know what love was till I met you.

You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you and I always will
