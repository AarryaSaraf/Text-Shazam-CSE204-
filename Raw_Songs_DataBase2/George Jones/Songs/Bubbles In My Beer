Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past, rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

A vision of someone who loved me
Brings alone silent tear to my eye
Oh! I know that my life's been a failure
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with hearthaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past, that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer.

As I think of the heart that I've broken
And the chances I know have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer...
