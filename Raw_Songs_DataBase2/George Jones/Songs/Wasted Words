The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care.

I tried so hard to forget the thing that used to be
Bit it's so easy to remember a few old memories
Just when I think I'm doing fine someone speaks your name
And I have to talk about though I know it's all in vain.

The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care.

An old friend tries to tell me that I shouldn't feel so blue
But that old friend he just don't know the love I have for you
Forget the past and have some fun go out with someone new
But it's so hard to turn the pages when I know no one but you.

The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care
