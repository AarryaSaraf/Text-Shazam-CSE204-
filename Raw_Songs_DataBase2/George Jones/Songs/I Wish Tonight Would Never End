Go out on a date with me tonight kiss me hard and hold me tight
Baby, I've loved you for so long
You're really just a huggin' and kiss and pet, make love that ain't been made yet
Baby, true love just can't be wrong.

Make us some plans about a weddin' day that's comin' up real soon
So I'm a gonna take you out tonight and I'm a gonna treat you real, real nice
Wish that tonight would never end.

Well, a we'll a get in about two o'clock and all your neighbors in the block
They won't know what time that you get in
'Cause we'll a just a sneak up to your door, kiss me once and I'll beg for more
Wish that tonight would never end.

Yeah, yeah, we'll make love underneath the stars under a lover's moon
Make us some plans about a weddin' day that's comin' up real soon
So I'm a gonna take you out tonight and I'm a gonna treat you real, real nice
Wish that tonight would never end...
