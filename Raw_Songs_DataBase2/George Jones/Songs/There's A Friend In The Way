We can explain this one too clearly cause he's known he's a friend
That's standing in the pathway of our love
Yes we love each other dearly but we just can't find the way
Night and day there's friend in the way
I told him once I loved him too and he thinks I'd never lie
To me he's been like my right hand he thinks I'm quite a guy
Yes we love each other dearly but we just can't find the way
Night and day there's friend in the way
I told him once I loved him too...
