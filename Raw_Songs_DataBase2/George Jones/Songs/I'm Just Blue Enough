I'm just blue enough to do most anything
And I know I'm going to hate myself again
But I know you don't want me like I want you
Or you'd be afraid to let me get this blue.

You could call me up and tell me that you're blue
I can make believe you're not with someone new
You could give my heart the will to part with pain
I'm just blue enough to do most anything.

You can get forgiveness for the wrong you've done
Or the heartache that you caused by that response
But the words you spoke you never can undo
That's what you've done to make me in love with you.

You could call me up and tell me that you're blue
I can make believe you're not with someone new
You could give my heart the will to part with pain
I'm just blue enough to do most anything...
