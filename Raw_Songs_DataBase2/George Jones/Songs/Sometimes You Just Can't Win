Just when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
Then the clouds fill the sky's
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just cant win.

My love never meant much to you dear
Or yo you I was always a friend
Oh, why did I call, 
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just cant win.

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I should't care 
But sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just cant win

And then when the sunshines the brightest
And the world looks alright, again
The clouds fill the sky's 
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win...
