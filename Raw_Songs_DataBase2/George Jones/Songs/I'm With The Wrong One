I'm with the wrong one, yes, I know it
I'm with the wrong one and I can show it
Because I love you but I know you don't seem to care how much I cry
If you just knew how much I love you now
Just stop your lyin', stop me from cryin'
But you don't wanna show your love for me is gone
I'm with the wrong one.

I'm with the wrong one but you don't care
You don't know the pain I bear
I'm just another what can I do
I'm someone new to you it's true
I love you dearly and so sincerely
But you don't wanna be the only one for me
Although it hurts me so I have to let you go
I'm with the wrong one.

I'm with the wrong one
