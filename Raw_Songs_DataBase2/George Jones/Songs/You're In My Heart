Please believe me when I say I can only feel one way
Every minute of the day you're in my heart
As I go down life's highway every night and every day
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart

Nothing dear could change my mind
You're in my heart to stay all the time
There will never in this world ever be a sweeter girl
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart

Nothing dear could change my mind
You're in my heart to stay all the time
There will never in this world ever be a sweeter girl
Please believe me when I say you're in my heart
