Everybody tells me you're a cheater
Yes and everybody says you cheated too
Should we believe them and let them tear our love apart
Or should we believe what's in our hearts

I believe in my heart the one I love is true
And I'd never take a chance on losing you
Side by side hand in hand we'll never be apart
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts

Only your two lips could make me happy
And I'm sure you know I feel the same way too
Together we will share a tender love no one can part
Just as long as we believe what's in our hearts

I believe in my heart the one I love is true...
