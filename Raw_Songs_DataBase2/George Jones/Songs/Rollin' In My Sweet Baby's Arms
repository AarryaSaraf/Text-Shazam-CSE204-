Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail tain comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

I ain't gonna work on the railroad
(You ain't gonna work at all if you can help itÂ !)
No, I ain't gonna work on the farm
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

My mama was a beauty operator
Sister could sew and could mend
My daddy owned an interest in that old sorghum mill
Just-a watchin' all that money roll in

Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
Rollin' in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
I'll lay around this shack
'Til the mail train comes back
An' I'll roll in my sweet baby's arms

Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
Roll in my sweet baby's arms (roll in my sweet baby's arms)
I'll lay around this shack...
