It's a sin, my darlin', how I love you
Because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgetten me.

But dreams are built for us as humblers
Each tie is broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So mush in love and yet so far apart

I'm sure you're happy with another
Whose cares and lovin' I can't win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin...
