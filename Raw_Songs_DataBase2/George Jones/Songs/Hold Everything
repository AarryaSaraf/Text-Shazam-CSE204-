Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't be tempted by their money and booze
Nobody's gonna fill my shoes.
When I get back I won't even knock
'Cause the same ole keys fits the same ole locks
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't try to sell our little shack
Just keep it till I get back.
Just keep everything in apple shape
If you feel to quessy put on the brake
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Just meet 'em at the door with a 44
And tell 'em I'm right next door.
If they ask you for a date just show 'em they gate
And if they don't like it tell them your to late
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything I'm a-comin' home
No matter how far I roam
When I return we're gonna be alone
You'll forget I've ever been gone.
When I get back you won't sleep
And you won't have much time to eat
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone...
