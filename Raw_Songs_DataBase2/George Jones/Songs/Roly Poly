Roly Poly, eatin' corn n' 'taters,
Hungry ev'ry minute of the day;
Roly Poly, gnawin' on a biscuit,
Long as he can chew it, it's okay.

He can eat an apple pie,
An' never even bat an eye,
He likes everything from soup to hay;
Roly Poly, daddy's little fattie
Bet he's gonna be a man someday.

Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast,
Bread n' jelly twenty times a day;
Roly Poly, eats a hardy dinner,
It takes lots of strength to run and play.

Pulls up weeds and does the chores,
And he runs both ways to all the stores,
He works up an appetite that way;
Roly Poly, daddy's little fattie,
Bet he's gonna be a man someday...
