Now if your baby's steppin' out
And makes you feel like a fool
Don't blow your top, don't rave and shout
Play it cool, man, play it cool

She'll run around and have her fun
She'll act like a kid in school
But she'll get tired and come back home
Play it cool, man, play it cool

She's really smart but she may act like a dunce upon a stool
Don't get the sweats, she'll come back yet
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now if you think she's flippin 'round
Like a fish that's out of its pool
Don't you fret or get all wet
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now if you think that your darlin'
She can use you like a tool
Just lock the door, and don't beg for more
Play it cool, man, play it cool

Now she don't know just what it's like
To make a fool man drool
Don't lose your head and wish you were dead
Play it cool, man, play it cool
