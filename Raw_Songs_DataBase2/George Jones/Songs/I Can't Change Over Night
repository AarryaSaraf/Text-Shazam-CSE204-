There's a love in my heart that I've been keeping.
I don't know how to give it away to someone new.
Oh, you walked out the door and left me weeping,
And I can't change overnight, from loving you.

If I can't walk with you, then I'll walk all alone.
Till my feet touch the ground, and that's where I'll call home.
I don't like all this loneliness that I go through.
But I can't change overnight, from loving you.

Oh, you say to forget the lips I used to kiss.
Find someone to take your place, or the love I once knew.
Yes, you walked out the door and left me weeping,
And I can't change overnight, from loving you.

If I can't walk with you, then I'll walk all alone.
Where my feet touch the ground, then that's where I'll call home.
I don't like all this loneliness that I go through.
But I can't change overnight, from loving you...
