Well I guess I been hanging around too long
It's just about time I was moving along
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
Don't you worry and don't you moan
It's just about time I was moving along
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna leave this sinful world before the dawning
And don't you worry and don't you moan
It's just about time I was moving on
Just before you carry me away
Don't you bury me deep cause I ain't gonna stay
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
Just a little bit of dirt and a little bit of gravel
Don't you weigh me down cause you know I gotta travel
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus...
