Oh, I believe the time is coming when the Lord will come again
I believe the end is closer every day
Let's be ready for the judgement when we look upon his face
For he tells us in his word to watch and pray.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.

While upon the Mount of Olives his disciples came to him
Saying tell us when these things are going to be
Jesus answered be ye watching let each one be free from sin
And take heed no man shall ever you deceive.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four...
