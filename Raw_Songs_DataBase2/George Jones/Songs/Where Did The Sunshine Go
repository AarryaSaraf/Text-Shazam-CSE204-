Where did the sunshine go why is it raining so
Where is the love I used to know where did the sunshine go
Where did the sunshine go why do the cold winds blow
Where is the one I needed so where did the sunshine go

I discovered the sunshine in a woman's loving smile
Like a fool I thought the sun had come to stay
Then she fell for another and the sun went out of style
And the springtime vanished when I went away

Where did the sunshine go...

Now there's mothing but heartaches in the whole wide lonely earth
Anyway my blue world looks that way to me
Gone is all of the sunshine and the smile that gave it birth
Leaving nothingbut a cold cold misery

Where did the sunshine go...
