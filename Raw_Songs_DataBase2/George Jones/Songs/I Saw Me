For the first time tonight I saw me
And I said to myself what a fool
He placed a crown on your head
Believed the lies, each one you said
For the first time tonight I saw me.

Yes, I looked into my eyes
And saw the reason why she cried
Saw a picture of a fool
Who should still be by her side.

For the first time tonight I saw me
And I'm ashamed for now I can see
Love she gave all in vain
I was one, her everything
For the first time tonight I saw me.

Yes, I looked into my eyes
And saw the reason why she cried
Saw a picture of a fool
Who should still be by her side.

For the first time tonight I saw me
And I'm ashamed for now I can see
Love she gave all in vain
I was one, her everything
For the first time tonight I saw me.

Yes, for the first time tonight I saw me...
