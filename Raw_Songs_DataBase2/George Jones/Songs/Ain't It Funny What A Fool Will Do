(Funny what a fool will do.)

Here am I without your arms again
Oh, how many times have you walked out and walked back in
And I cried just like a baby, after you
Oh, oh, It's funny what a fool will do.

Here am I with empty arms, again
Counting all the times that you walked out and walked back in
Still my heart goes right on wanting you
Oh, oh, It's funny what a fool will do.

Is you love worth all these heartaches, I don't think so
I can't hold you and yet I can't let you go
You just keep and I hope my faith in you
Oh, oh,  It's funny what a fool will do.

Oh, oh,  It's funny what a fool will do...
