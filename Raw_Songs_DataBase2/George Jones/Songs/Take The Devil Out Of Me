Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

I've traveled far down this lonesome road
The devil he's got me bent down so low
I've just found out where I want to be
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

I'm getting tired of living in sin
I'm tired of keeping the devil for my friend
I want so badly to be set free
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.

Now, I'm so happy, I'm free from sin
Because I left my dear Savior in
My Jesus told me that I was free
Oh Jesus, thank you
You took the devil outta me.

I'm getting tired of living in sin
I'm tired of keeping the devil for my friend
I want so badly to be set free
Oh Jesus, please
Please take the devil outta me.
