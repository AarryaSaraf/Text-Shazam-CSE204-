On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

When trouble surrounds us
When evil's come
The body grows weak (body grows weak)
And the spirit grows numb (spirit grows numb)

When these things beset us
He doesn't forget us
He sends down his love (sends down his love)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

When noah had drifted
In the flood many days
He searched for land (He searched for land)
In various ways (In various ways)

Troubles he had some
But wasn't forgotten
He sent down his love (sent down his love)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from abouve (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)...
