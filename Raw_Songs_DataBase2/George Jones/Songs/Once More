Once more to be with you dear just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune if I could see you once more
Forget (forget) the past (the past) this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love (your love) I crave (I crave) I'll be I'll be your slave
If you'll just give me all of your heart
Once more to be with you dear...
Forget (forget) the past (the past)...
