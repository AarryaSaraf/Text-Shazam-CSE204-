Well I was standin' in the tavern a-feelin' blue
My foot on the rail, just a-thinkin' 'bout you
But I won't be blue all day
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Well I've been blue before and I will again
I'll drown all my worries or I'll teach 'em how to swim
And I won't be the one to pay
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Yes, you thought when you left I wouldn't have any fun
I'll admit I worried but I won't be long
We're apart because you wouldn't swallow your foolish pride
So you hurt me deep inside

But you're not the first to hurt me and you won't be the last
Can't tell the future, but I've learned from the past
As long as there'd a cabaret
I know relief - is just a swallow away

Well, I looked down the bar and what did I see
Your sad-lookin' face a-lookin' back at me
Wishin' you could turn time a few hours back
Get off of that one-way track

Well you want me to come over, but I'll tell you true
You're as close to me as I am to you
And that may still be too far away
Because relief - is just a swallow away

I said relief - just a swallow away...
