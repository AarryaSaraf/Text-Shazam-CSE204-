From Morenci, Arizona where the copper mines glow
I could see Clifton in the canyon below
In Clifton lived Rosie; we danced and we dined
On the money I made in the open pit mine
I loved my sweet Rosie and she loved me too
There was nothing for Rosie that I wouldn't do
Her hugs and her kisses, they were something divine
Gave me reason for working the open pit mine

While I was out walking with my Rosie one day
We passed a store window with rings on display
I bought the one she wanted; how they really did shine!
Spent the money I saved from that open pit mine
Her love would bring heartbreak that I would soon learn
Cause she would two-time me when my back was turned
Rosie would go dancing and drink the red wine
While I worked like a slave in that open pit mine

One night I caught Rosie on her rendezvous
She was huggin' and kissin' with somebody new
It was there that I shot her while their arms where entwined!
Then I buried her deep in that open pit mine
I took a look at my future and what did I see?
There was nothing but trouble a-waiting for me
But on the sun's next risin', I'll be satisfied
Cause they'll find me there sleeping by my sweet Rosie's side
