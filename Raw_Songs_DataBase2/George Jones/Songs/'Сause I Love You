I've had my problems with running 'round
But now I want to settle down
There nothing I won't do to be with you
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There nothing I won't do cause I love you

I did agree to set you free
On you I have no claim
But now I see you're for me
Won't you please take back my name
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There's nothing I won't do cause I love you

I did agree to set you free
On you I have no claim
But now I see you're for me
Won't you please take back my name
I'm gonna start this very day
Yes, I'm gonna change my way
There's nothing I won't do cause I love you
