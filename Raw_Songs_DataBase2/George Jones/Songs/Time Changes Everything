There was a time when I thought of no other,
And we sang our own love's refrain;
Our hearts beat as one as we had our fun, 
But time changes everything.

When you left me my poor heart was broken 
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark cloud have gone and there's blue skies again 
'Cause, time changes everything.

Well, time has passed, I've forgot you 
Mother nature does wonderful things
I guess that it's true for me and for you 
'Cause, time changes everything.

Oh, you can change the name of an old song 
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you 
But time changes everything.

So good luck to you, may god bless you
I can't say that we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine
'Cause, time changes everything...
