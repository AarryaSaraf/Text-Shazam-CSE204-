I just don't like this kind of livin' I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
I give my all and sit and yearn and get no lovin' in return
And I just don't like this kind of livin'
Why do we stay together if we always fuss and fight
You ain't never done to be wrong and I ain't never been right
Tell me where you think we're goin' cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
When things go wrong you go your way you leave me here to pay and pay
And I just don't like this kind of livin'

I just don't like the things you're doin' your evil heart will be your ruin
When things start running smooth and free you haul right off and you pick on me
And I just don't like this way of livin'
They say the road of love is long it's rocky and it's rough
But if this road don't start to get smooth I've traveled it long enough
Why don't you act a little bit older and get that chip off of your shoulder
Well I told you once now I'll tell you twice you better start to treatin' me nice
Cause I just don't like this kind of livin'
