I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I tried to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you.

No matter what the world may say, about you
I know your love will always be true
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time I'm walking by your side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide.

No matter what
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.
