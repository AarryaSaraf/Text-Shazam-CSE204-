I'm dreaming tonight of the mountains that's where I long to roam
The roosters crow at the break of day in my Dixie home sweet home
Old people here they just don't care I never saw the beat
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
I'm going back to my old home in the mountains far away
Where the wild red roses smell so sweet and the rippling waters play
Old people here they just don't care...
This city life is not for me I'm going where the neighbors speak
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
Old people here they just don't care...
That road ahead is mighty long but it's Dixieland for me
