I was standin' by my window
On one cold, and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rollin'
For to carry my mother away.

Will that circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky.

I went back home, my home was lonely
For my mother she was gone
All my brothers set to cryin'
For the home so sad and alone.

Undertaker, please undertaker,
Undertaker, please drive slow
For that body you are hauling
Lord, I hates to see her go

Will that circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky, Lord, in the sky...
