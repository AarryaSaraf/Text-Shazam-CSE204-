They're making cheap imitations of everything
From rubber tires to leather gloves
But the cheapest imitation that I've ever seen
Was your imitation of love.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only foolin', you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of livin'
You were only givin' an imitation of love.

Why, when I first met you, you were so sweet
I thought you must have come from above
So I feel for you but when you made your play
It was an imitation of love.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only foolin', you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of livin'
You were only givin' an imitation of love.

From the very first time that I was kissing you lips
Till the last time I was in your arms
You were copying love and making believe
The you were faking with all of your charms.

Imitation of love, there's no heart in it
You were only fooling, you never meant it
Imitation of love, I'm tired of living
You were only givin' an imitation of love...
