Well, I've been thinking about you all night long
What you been a doing to me
You told me that you love me, I thought that you loved me
But you never was true to me.

Well they say you're getting tired of all your running around
You're wanting me to settle dowm
It too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.

Well, there's things I've been wanting to tell you
There's a lot of things you need to know
And I don't think I'll wait for a later date
Now's the time to let you know.

'Cause there's been too many nights I've waited at your door
While you run around on me
But I got to thinking my ship started sinking
And I thought I'd better swim the sea.

So now my telephones ringing, pretty girls singing
So go ahead and run around
It's just too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.

Well, there's things I've been wanting to tell you
There's a lot of things you need to know
And I don't think I'll wait for a later date
Now's the time to let you know.

And I thought I'd better swim the sea.

It's just too much water run under the bridge
And I'm too mad to come back now.
