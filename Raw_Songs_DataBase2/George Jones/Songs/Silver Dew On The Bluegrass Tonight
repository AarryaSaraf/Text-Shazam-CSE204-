The moon was softly shing on an old Kentucky home
The fragrance of magnolia's filled the air
A lonely girl was writing to her sweet heart all alone
To say how much she wished that she were there.

Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, ow I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight.

Star of love, high above shining bright
Know the wish that I'm wishing tonight
And you'll bring him back, I know, to the one who loves him so
Star of love high above shining bright.

Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, how I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight...
