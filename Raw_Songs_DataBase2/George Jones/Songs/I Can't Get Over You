Oh well don't let the spinning ever stop you've got me spinning like a top
Going round and round is all I do
I can't tell the day from night I don't know the wrong from right
I only know I can't get over you
I've got an angel on one shoulder the devil on the other
I'm in between oh tell me what to do
One tells me let you go the other tells me no
I only know I can't get over you
You've got me spinning like a top don't let this spinning ever stop
Just tell me that your love for me is true
My heartaches disappear when you say I love you dear
I only know I can't get over you
I've got an angel on one shoulder...
I've got an angel on one shoulder...
I only know I can't get over you
