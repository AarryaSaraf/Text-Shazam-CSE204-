I let you go when I needed you so
Not knowing then I want you back again
Now that you're gone there's one thing I know
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind
That you was within these arms of mine
It's too late now another's love you hold
I'll always regret I let you go
It hurts to know it was you I love so
Old mem'ry of you comes back to make me blue
One thought of you and tears begin to flow
I'll always regret I let you go
Such a fool was I to be so blind...
