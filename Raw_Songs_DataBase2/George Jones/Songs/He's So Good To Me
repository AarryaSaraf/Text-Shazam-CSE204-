He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
When life darkness starts closing in
I meet in secret with my special friend
He talks to me and calmness begins
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me

Each days burdens may touch my soul
But I meet with him and He makes me whole
My troubles gone and rest on the sea
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me...
