(No they'll never, ever take her love from me)

If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is one who's smiling face, the God's would see
'Cause she'll walk along beside me, up to golden stairs
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me.

What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And to see her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me.

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the used to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in uncaress
But they'll never, ever take her love from me.

I thought I could make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the day that she became another's bride
I'll say, they'll never, ever take her love from me...
