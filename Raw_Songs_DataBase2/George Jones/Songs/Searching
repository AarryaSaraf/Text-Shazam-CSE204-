Searching I've spent a lifetime darling
Searching looking for someone like you
Dreaming in all my dreams I dream that someday
I'd find someone like you
Other loves have come my way but they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay don't ever set me free
Cause I've been searching I've spent a lifetime darling searching
Looking for someone just like you
Other loves have come my way...
