In the morning paper there's a picture of you
Smiling just as you did in days before
Tomorrow you'll be web and my heart is just like lead
But I've just got to see you once more.

You look so lovely in your wedding gown
It will only hurt me all the more
When the groom kisses you my poor heart will break in two
And I've just got to see you once more.

He's such a lucky guy to have you for his own
Funny I couldn't see that before
My broken heart won't mend and I'll never love again
And I've just got to see you once more.

After the wedding then I'll go back home
And I'll cry as I never cried before
When the groom kisses you my poor heart will break in two
But I've just got to see you once more...
