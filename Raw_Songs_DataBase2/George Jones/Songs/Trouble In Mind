Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
Because the sun's gonna shine 
In my back door someday.

I'm gonna lay my head
On some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19
Pass through my worried mind.

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
And I've almost lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like livin'
Sometimes I feel like dyin'.

I'm going down to the river
I'm going to buy me a rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'm goin' to rock away from here.

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
My ole heart is a-beating slow
I never had so much trouble
In my life before.

My good gal she's gone to Sydney
And it sure did grieve my mind
When you see me laughing
I'm just a-trying to keep from cryin'.

Trouble In Mind...
