Well, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, if I see that's heaven's story
Ain't nothin' ever a-go wrong
Ah, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not might tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, I may not be able to preach
And I may not be able to sing
I may not be able to do very much
For my Lord and King
But if this one thing I'm persuaded
Oh, do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
If I keep a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' gonna ever go wrong
Cause, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Although the path grows rugged
And although the path grows steep
I keep a-trusting in my savior
Who is so mighty that he
And when the saints go marchin' in there
I'll sing a victory song
Yes, by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
If I keep on a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' ever gonna ever go wrong
And, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along

Well, when I reach my home in Heaven
The sweet land above
I'm gonna sing redemptions story
I'm gonna praise Him for His love
And when the saints go marchin' in there
Do you dare tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Yeah, I'm a-gonna tag along with Jesus
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along
Well, if I keep a-tellin' the story
Ain't nothin' gonna ever go wrong
Cause, when the saint goes marchin' in there
Do not tell me I'm wrong
For by the help and the grace of God
I'm a-gonna keep a-taggin' along...
