You've got to run to win the race
Go along the way and quick the pace
So remember when you're worried faith is fallin' down
That you got to bear a cross if you want to wear a crown
Our Lord is testing us each day
He'll try us out in every way
So don't despair when burdens fall around
You got to bear a cross if you want to wear a crown

We've seen some men rise to the top
Then fall apart if they should drop
They can't live on without their wealth
They blame the Lord above and they never blame themselves
Out of these fallen some will rise
Accept their fate and realize
That their own trial to God they'll hear the trumpet sound
That you got to bear the cross if you want to wear a crown...
