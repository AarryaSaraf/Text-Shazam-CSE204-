When my heart hurts no more and the flames just an ember
Love that I begged you for I won't even remember
I'll be no weeping willow when I've learned the score
No more tears on my pillow when my heart hurts no more.

When my heart hurts no more, that's what I'm longin' for
To be free from the spell, that's all been so well
I will have to keep wonderin' what I'm livin' for
I won't be at your mercy when my heart hurts no more.

When my heart hurts no more, that's what I'm liviin' for
When at last I'll be free from your memory
I won't have to keep wonderin' what I'm living for
I'll be no weeping willow when my heart hurts no more...
