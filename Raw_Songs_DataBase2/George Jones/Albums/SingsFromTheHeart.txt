// Cold, Cold Heart //

You don't know who I am,
But I know all about you;
I've come to talk to you tonight,
About the things I've seen you do.

I've come to set the record straight,
I've come to shine the light on you;
Let me introduce myself,
I am the cold hard truth.

There is a woman we both know,
I think you know the one I mean;
She gave her heart and soul to you,
You gave her only broken dreams.

You say you're not the one to blame,
For all the heartaches she's been through;
I say you're nothin' but a liar,
And I'm the cold hard truth.

All your life that's how it's been,
Looking out for number one;
Taking more than you leave,
Moving on when your done.

With her you could have had it all,
A family and lots of laughs;
If you had any sense at all,
You'd go and beg her to come back.

You think that you're a real man,
But you're nothing but a fool;
The way you run away from love,
The way you try to play it cool.

I gonna say this just one time,
Time is running out on you;
You best remember me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth.

You best remeber me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth...

// Frozen Heart //

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
Needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and warm it with your love
I can't count the times I've hide my face
Tryin' just to be in your warm embrace
The winter of life has fallen at my door
If you said I don't love you any more

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
I'm needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and won't you warm it with your love...

// Talk To Me Lonesome Heart //

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru my darkest gloom
Help me bring her mem'ry to this lonely room

Talk to me and let me cry the whole night thru
You have lost, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Talk about the love I miss
Talk to me about the lips I used to kiss

Tell me how she used to smile
Just before she said goodbye
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart, while I cry

Talk to me and let me cry the whole night thru
You have lost, yes, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright...

// Achin', Breakin' Heart //

Well, I have lived a lot and done my part of running round
And never did I think I'd let her sweet love get me down
But now I see how wrong I was you're part of every plan
Perhaps I pay but come what may my heart's at your command
Oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do
You drop me like the others and go find somebody new

Last night I saw you darling in the arms of someone new
And I know that you don't love him you just want to make me blue
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more
But someday from you darling this old heart will lock its door
Oh, this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you
And I'm afraid to let you know I love you like I do
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do
You drop me like the others and go find somebody new...

// Hearts In My Dreams //

I dreamed that all the hearts I've broken came to visit me
And in my sleep they came to pay me for their misery
They were all so torn and shattered, Oh such tales of woe
It was I who caused them all and my conscience hurts me so.

Hearts in my dream, each one of them true
Each one loved me so, each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see.

Hearts in my dream, each one of them true
Each one loved me so, each one I broke in two
My younger days were wild and reckless
Just love 'em and let 'em be
Those days are gone although it took a dream to make me see...

// Candy Hearts //

Once upon a time when we were in our teens
We shared our future hopes and plans and many lovely dreams
Do you recall that happy day about my love that true
And I gave a box of candy hearts with these new words to you
One little heart said I love you, one said please be mine
One said kisses to you dear and one said your divine
One little heart said dear you're the sweetest one said love me true
So with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you

Now the lonely night are passin' while I'm far away
I wonder if you'll feel the same when I return someday
I can't forget I love you yet and I always will
So I'm sending candy hearts to say exactly how I feel
One little heart said I love you, one said please be mine
One said kisses to you dear and one said your divine
One little heart said dear you're the sweetest one said love me true
So with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you
Yes, with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you...

// With Half A Heart //

I never thought I'd see the day
That you would come to me and say 
I am sorry that we had ever met
I guess it all just goes to show
How little one can really know
Somebody that's my darling you can bet

I'll never again risk all my chips
On laughing eyes and lying lips
I may risk some but I'll hold back a part
At burnt child always fears the fire
Though you may fill me with desire
I'll do my loving with half a heart

Half a love is better than none
I may miss out on half the fun
But it won't hurt me half as much if we should part
I may just feel just half the bliss
If we share just half a kiss
But I'll always be left with just half a heart

I only wished that I could be
Sure that the next gal that loved me
Would love completely with her heart and soul
But I'm afraid she'll let me down
And laugh at me all over town
So I'm gonna keep my self-control

He who loves and runs away will love again another day
Will be my motto from the very start
I'll never again be taken in by twinkle
And a dimple chin
I'll do my lovin' with half a heart

Half a love is better than noneâ€¦.

// Heartaches By The Number //

Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop countin'
That's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And told me you were coming home to stay
With hoping heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop countin'
That's the day my world will end

Oh, the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end

One line in reservation, is this

// When My Heart Hurts No More //

When my heart hurts no more and the flames just an ember
Love that I begged you for I won't even remember
I'll be no weeping willow when I've learned the score
No more tears on my pillow when my heart hurts no more.

When my heart hurts no more, that's what I'm longin' for
To be free from the spell, that's all been so well
I will have to keep wonderin' what I'm livin' for
I won't be at your mercy when my heart hurts no more.

When my heart hurts no more, that's what I'm liviin' for
When at last I'll be free from your memory
I won't have to keep wonderin' what I'm living for
I'll be no weeping willow when my heart hurts no more...

// I Gotta Talk To Your Heart //

I've gotta talk to your heart
You have no right to make me cry
The love I've shone for you these years
Can't be washed away with tears
I've gotta talk to your heart.

I've gotta make you understand
Our love is drifting far apart
Won't you please stop where you are
Let's not carry this too far
I've gotta talk to your heart.

Who'd told you all those lies
That brought tears to your eyes
You know this never could be
So before you say goodbye
Give me another try
And I'll prove they're wrong you'll see.

I've gotta talk to your heart
Just gotta make you understand
I've gotta try to change your mind
Give me just a little time
I've gotta talk to your heart.

Who'd told you all those lies
That brought tears to your eyes
You know this never could be
So before you say goodbye
Give me another try
And I'll prove they're wrong you'll see.

I've gotta talk to your heart
Just gotta make you understand
I've gotta try to change your mind
Give me just a little time
I've gotta talk to your heart.

// Tender Years //

You keep saying you love him
I believe that it's true
And it just doesn't matter
How much I love you

But in time you'll understand, dear
When you shed a tear
Then you'll know you were living
In your tender years (tender years)

In your eyes there's a lovelight
That shines for him
But how long will it stay there
Will that love light grow dim

You can just see the happiness
You can't see the tears
Yes it's true, you've been living
In your tender years (tender years)

So if I can't be your first love
I'll wait and be your last
I'll be somewhere in your future
To help you forget the past

And you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
'Cause I'll wait 'til you're thru living
In your tender years (tender years)

Yes, you'll know that I love you
With a love that's sincere
Yes, I'll wait 'til you're thru living
In your tender years... (tender years)...
