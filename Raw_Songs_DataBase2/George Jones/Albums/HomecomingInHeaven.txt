// Wandering Soul //

Oh, lend me a hand, please Lord, and guide me
And help lead me down the road that is right
Oh, carry me through these hours of darkness
And show me the path of shining light

I'm a wandering soul, I'm lost from my Savior
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold
Just tarrying along in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday, You'll save my soul

Dear Lord, please forgive the grief I have caused You
The thought of my sins that tortures my soul
Oh, help me to know the joy of salvation
Help cleanse my life through and make me whole

I'm a wandering soul, lost from my Savior
A sheep that has strayed so far from the fold
Just a-tarrying along in the clutch of old Satan
But I'm hoping someday, You'll save my soul

// Someone's Watching Over You //

(Someone who's watching over you tonight)
If you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching over you tonight
If you lend the hand to every man
And you treat him like he's your friend
And your conscience tells you you've done what's right
Then there's someone who's watching over you tonight
Yes friends you know he'll watch over you
As you rest your very weary head
And the angels will always be standing there
Yes right there when you'll be dead
So if you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching someone who's watching
Someone who's watching over you tonight

// He Made Me Free //

I had drifted for so long with my life so full of wrong
That the Lord should have turned his back on me
But he took the trembling hand of a lost and lonely man
Broke the chains from mortal shame and made me free
Yes he took away the sin from my soul where it had been
And he helped my blinding eyes again to see
Yes and now I understand the beauty of salvation's plan
Out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free
I had sunk so deep in shame never calling on his name
All the joys of life had turned to misery
But then he gave me back control of my lost and wandering soul
Removed the fears dried my tears and made me free
Yes he took away the sin that had stained me deep within
And he gave me back the fate that I might see
Now I'm so glad I understand the promise of salvation's plan
Out on the cross you paid the cost and made me free

// Beacon In The Night //

Many souls are driftin' on the troubled sea of sin
The under tow of evil has pulled so many in
Tonight the troubled ways of sorrow fill our hearts with pride
And we're so blind that we can't see the beacon in the night.

The beacon in the night is always shinin'
And darkest clouds can have a silver linin'
Just set your torch for glory then don't turn left or right
Heavens shore is lighted by the beacon in the night.

When the mist of wickedness conceals the beacon's light
And you're driftin' through the fog somewhere out in the night
The one who whispers peace be still and calms the raging sea
He is the beacon in the night, He'll rescue you and me.

The beacon in the night is always shinin'
And storm clouds can have a silver linin'
So set your course for glory and don't turn left or right
Be guided straight to Heaven by the beacon in the night

// Mathew Twenty-Four //

Oh, I believe the time is coming when the Lord will come again
I believe the end is closer every day
Let's be ready for the judgement when we look upon his face
For he tells us in his word to watch and pray.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.

While upon the Mount of Olives his disciples came to him
Saying tell us when these things are going to be
Jesus answered be ye watching let each one be free from sin
And take heed no man shall ever you deceive.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four.

We are living, surely living in the days he speaks about
I believe the end is near in every door
So let's be ready for his coming let us meet him with a shout
And believe today in Matthew twenty-four...

// He's So Good To Me //

He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
When life darkness starts closing in
I meet in secret with my special friend
He talks to me and calmness begins
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me

Each days burdens may touch my soul
But I meet with him and He makes me whole
My troubles gone and rest on the sea
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
He is so good to me
When I am down he comforts me
He is so good to me...

// Kneel At The Feet Of Jesus //

Well I guess I been hanging around too long
It's just about time I was moving along
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
Don't you worry and don't you moan
It's just about time I was moving along
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna leave this sinful world before the dawning
And don't you worry and don't you moan
It's just about time I was moving on
Just before you carry me away
Don't you bury me deep cause I ain't gonna stay
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
Just a little bit of dirt and a little bit of gravel
Don't you weigh me down cause you know I gotta travel
I'm a gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus in the morning
I'm gonna kneel at the feet of Jesus...

// Homecoming In Heaven //

My years have been many,
My loved ones are gone,
And I miss them more every day. 
I'm ready to move to that heavenly home 
And I yearn for the day I can say.

Take this ring from my finger,
These shoes from my feet
Take all of my worldly possessions away.  
Just leave me my bible,
A date I must keep, 
It's homecoming in heaven for me.

I'll kiss my ol' mother,
Shake hands with my dad,
I know they'll remember their boy.
We'll all be so happy
And I'll be so glad, 
As our cup runneth over with joy!

Take this ring from my finger,
These shoes from my feet
Take all of my worldly possessions away. 
Just leave me my bible,
A date I must keep, 
It's homecoming in heaven for me..

// My Cup Runneth Over //

Dark days ago (dark days ago)
I walked all alone (walked all alone)
I thought for my sins I could never atone
But then I was loved when I heard a voice say
Look and I'll turn all your darkness to day
Then I knelt down to pray (knelt down to pray.)

Now my cup runneth over (cup runneth over)
Life is so sweet (life is so sweet)
All I could hope for to make it complete
Down lifes silvery pathway He's walkin' with me
My cup runneth over, no sorrow I'll see

My future looks bright (future looks bright)
My heart is at ease (heart is at ease)
And every night while down on my knees
I thank the good Lord who smiles from above
And the happiess wraps me around like a glove
For I have His love (I have his love.)

My cup runneth over (cup runneth over)
Life is so sweet (life is so sweet)
All I could hope for to make it complete
Down lifes silvery pathway He's walkin' with me
My cup runneth over, from sin I am free
My Jesus saved me (Jesus saved me)
