Every man wants to be a macho man
To have the kind of body always in demand
Joggin' in the mornings, go man go
Workouts in the health spa, muscles grow

Body, it's so good, my body

You can tell a macho, he has a funky walk
his western shirts and leather, always look so boss
Funky with his body, he's a king

You can best believe that, he's a macho man

Every man ought to be a macho, macho man
To live a life of freedom, machos make a stand
Have your own lifestyles and ideals
Possess the strength of confidence, that's the skill
You can best believe that he's a macho man
He's the special god son in anybody's land

// I Am What I Am //

I am, I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, I'll be, I'll be
I am, I am, what I am, what I am, for the rights, for the rights, of man, hey

People have the right to be just who they are
People have the right to share all of their love
People have the right to share just what they give
The right to their free will.

I did not choose the way I am, I did not choose the way I am,

I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am,
I said I am what I a-a-am, Please try to understand,
I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am
I said I am what I a-a-am, I am just a man,
I was born into this wor-or-orld, Born into this world,

Say it, say it y'all
I am, I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, I'll be, hey, alright
I am, I am, what I am, what I am, for the rights, for the rights, of man, listen here

People have the right, regardless of their skin
People have the right to let God's love come in
People have the right to truly be yourfriend
To love is not a sin.

I did not choose the way I am, I did not choose the way I am,
I said I am what I am, This is my fellow man
I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am,

I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, for the rights, for the rights, of man, yeah

People have the right to live with who they please
People have the right to live there happily
No one has the right to choose my love for me
I was born free.

I did not choose the way I am, I did not choose the way I am,
I said I am what I am, This is my fellow man
I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am,

// Medley: Just A Gigolo / I Ain't Got Nobody //

I'm just a gigolo 
And everywhere I go 
People know the part I'm playing 
Pay for ev'ry dance 
Selling each romance 
Oh what they're sayin' 

And there will come a day 
When youth will pass away 
What will they say about me 
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigollo 
Life goes on without me 

I'm just a gigollo 
And everywhere I go 
People know the part I'm playing 
Pay for ev'ry dance 
Selling each romance 
Oh what they're sayin' 

And there will come a day 
When youth will pass away 
Well well well well well 
What will they say about me 
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigollo 
Life goes on without me 

Cause I ain't got nobody 
Well it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Cause I'm so sad and lonely 
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mamma come take a chance with me 
Cause I ain't so bad 

And I'll sing her sweet love songs 
All of the time 
Hey, she'll only be,

// Sodom And Gomorrah //

Sodom and Gomorrah 
This is the story, of Sodom and Gomorrah.
Two cities that were full, of hatred and lust.
Because their crimes were great.
Because of all their lust.
The Lord decided destruction, was a must.

This is what he said,
(Give me) Give me, 
(Fifty good men) just give me fifty good men,
(And I) and I'll, (Spare the whole city)
And I'll spare the whole city.
Give me, forty good men.
To destroy you all, would be a pity.

[Chorus:]
Oh - Sodom and Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.
Cities with one man you can't trust.
Sodom and Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.
Cities full of hatred and lust.
Sodom and Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.
Judgment Day is very close by.
Sodom and Gomorrah, Sodom and Gomorrah.
The flames will reach up high to the sky.

God sent two angels (to) Sodom and Gomorrah.
They were met by Lot, who bowed to the ground.
They went in to his home, before they could sit down.
The wicked men of Sodom, gathered 'round.

Here's what the angels said,
(Give me) Give me, 
(Thirty good men) give me thirty good men,
(And I) and I'll, (Spare the whole city)
And I'll spare the whole city.
Give me, twenty good men.
To destroy you all, would be a pity.
[Repeat Chorus]

The angels found one good man in Sodom and Gomorrah.
One man who did not have, a heart full of lust.
They told him to leave, to take his family,
and run to the mountains, for safety.

Their final warning was,
(Give me) Give me, 
(Just ten good men) give me just ten good men.
(And I) And I'll, (Spare the whole city)
And I'll spare the whole city.
Give me, just two good men.
To destroy you all, would be a pity.
[Repeat Chorus]
