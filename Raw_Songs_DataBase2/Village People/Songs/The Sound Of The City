Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the sound of the town
New York is the city of cities, New York is still wearing the crown
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the people I love
Everyone is speaking your language, New York speaks in your native tongue

New York (New York) - we're skatin' down Broadway
At midnight or midday - we do our own thing
New York (New York) - a city with gusto
New York is a big show - it's what's happening

Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the cars on the street
New York is the fans of the Yankees, New York is a cop on the beat
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the steeple bells chime
New York is a city of magic, New York is a hip state of mind

New York (New York) - the city of night life
The city of bright lights - we're doin' our part
New York (New York) - the city of fashion
The city of passion - this town has a heart

Listen to the sound of the city, New York is the pulse of the world
New York is the mecca that's Broadway, New York is the style on the girl
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the sound of my town
You can take a ride on the tramway, hold your breath while your comin' down

New York (New York), perpetual motion
From ocean to ocean - there's nothing compares
New York (New York) - the parks and the playgrounds
New York is the sweet sound - of children at play

Listen to the sound of the city, New York after dark is alive
Uptown in the Bronx or in Harlem, New York is a city with pride
Listen to the sound of the city, New York is both future and past
New York is the city of music, New York is the city with class

Listen to the sound of the city, Listen to the sound of the town
New York is the city of cities, New York is still wearing the crown
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the people I love
Everyone is speaking your language, New York speaks in your native tongue
