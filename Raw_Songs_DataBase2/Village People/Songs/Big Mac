Well, I've worked all over this world
And I've been in all kinds of places
From the sushi bars in Japan
To a crazy dart in Notre Dame
But there's only one thing I'm sure
When I'm hungry I need a cure
So when I first get into town
I just drink those patches down

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac

Well I'm not the kind to raise a fuss
But I know what it takes to please me
Not a taco that's hot off the grill
Or the spicey dishes served in Brazil
But when I'm driving in a hurry
And my eyes start getting blurry
Ain't no need to think it's the end
There's a fortune around the bend

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac

I'm so hungry, still not satisfied

Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
Nothing's better, nothing's better
Nothing's better than a Big Mac
