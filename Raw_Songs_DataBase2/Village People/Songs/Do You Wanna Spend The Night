Do you wanna spend the night                        

The party is nearly over                            
Will you have this dance with me                    
I've watched you here for hours                                             
set up with the passion lit                          
I feel my passion darling                            
and my heart beats just with you                    
The evening is to the fantasy                       
Tell them what you gonna do                         

Do you wanna spend the night

Do you wanna spend the night

Hapiness of heart is said                           
Is just a kiss away                                 
So acuse me baby let it see                         
and trust it when they say                          
I feel my body in tremble                           
and the earth's last quake                          
i never meant this ecstasy                          
How much more can i take
