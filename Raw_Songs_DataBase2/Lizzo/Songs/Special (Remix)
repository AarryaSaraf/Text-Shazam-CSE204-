Special

Woke up this morning to somebody judging me
No surprise they judging me
Don't know who I'm 'posed to be
I'm just acting up, I'm pressed as fuck and never saying sorry
Found it in the end, I can only do it for me
You call sensitive and I call it superpower
You just like empathy 'cause you think it gives you power
All I know is only God can judge me
I don't hide my heart, I wear it on me

I'm used to feelin' alone, oh (Alone)
So I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (Nobody, no, no)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (So glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

Special (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm

I'm used to feeling alone, so
I thought that I'd let you know, oh

In case nobody told you today (I wait around for you)
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (Nobody made you believe)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same (I'll always love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (Perfect)

I'm used to feelin' alone, oh (No, you're not alone)
So I thought that I'd let you know
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

In case nobody told you today (Nobody told you, nobody)
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special (Oh, yeah)
Well, I will always love you the same (I'll always love you, I'll always love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)

Special
You are, you are, you are, so
Special
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey
