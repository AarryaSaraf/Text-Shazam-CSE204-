That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

I woke up this morning
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it
Oh
I might be a bitch
I might make a friend
Ain't I so amazing?

Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

Don't hide no emotions
Wear 'em on my sleeve
All my feeling's Gucci
Can't hold back my tears
That would be a crime
'Cause I look pretty cryin'
Oh, they ain't tell you?

Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

I feel like hurtin' they feelings
I don't get mad, I get millions
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling

I ain't with that actin' all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
They fire close by like it's Whitney

Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust a whole clip till it's empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, God willing

Fire chains on like brr
Feelin' like rockin' my fur
Rolls Royce with the chauffer
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci

Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream
I could scream
I could scream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
