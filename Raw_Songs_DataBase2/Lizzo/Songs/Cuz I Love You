I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Never been in love before
What the fuck are fuckin' feelings yo?
Once upon a time I was a hoe
I don't even wanna hoe no more
Got you somethin' from the liquor store
Little bit of Lizzo and some Mo
Tryin' to open up a little more
Sorry if my heart a little slow

I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love impaired
But baby, baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
Yes you
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Got me standin' in the rain
Gotta get my hair pressed again
I would do it for you all my friend
Ready baby? Will you be my man?
Wanna put you on a plane
Fly you out to wherever I am
Kept you on the low, I was ashamed
Now I'm crazy 'bout to tat your name

I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love impaired
But baby, oh baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
Yeah, I'm cryin', hey!

I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love impaired
But baby, baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
Oh, yes you

I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
I'm cryin'

I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
