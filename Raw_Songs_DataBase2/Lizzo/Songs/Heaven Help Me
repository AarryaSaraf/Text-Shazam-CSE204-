Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Cold world, they'll be living in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me

Y'all who you think you sassing?
Say, whoa, baby, I'm a classic
Say, whoa, something like a Hitchcock
Say, whoa, got you going psycho
Oh, no, don't you get your shit rocked
Say, whoa, catch you with the tick tock
Say, whoa, time's up on these motherfuckers
Say, whoa, what you say, what you say, sucker?
Say, what, what you say?

If you think you've got me dickmatized (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I need to get you out of my life, can I get an amen?

Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Cold world, they'll be living in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me

Hit 'em with the Bible, say, whoa
Hit 'em with the drive-by, say, whoa
Hit 'em with the dry cry, say, whoa
Then you get a new guy, hello

Even if you are the love of my life (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Sorry, baby, I got too much pride

Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Cold world, they'll be living in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Love is a drug, methamphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me

Heaven help me, if love ain't dead, I'ma kill it 'cause it's killing me
Ooh, can I get an amen? (Amen)

Been thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you, baby
If love didn't drive me crazy, maybe I'd be your baby
Trust, baby, you can't make me, beg or try to change, hey
