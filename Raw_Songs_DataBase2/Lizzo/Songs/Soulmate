True story
No glory, let's go

Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type
They used to say, "To get a man, you gotta know how to look"
They used to say, "To keep a man, you had to know how to cook"
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju with Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"
(One, one, one) The one
(One, one, one like) Damn, she the one
(One, one, one) The one
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
(Love, love, love) Like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
Look up in the mirror like, "Yeah, she the one"

And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

True love ain't somethin' you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down (Always gonna hold me down)
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely (No, I'm never lonely, no)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"
(One, one, one) The one
(One, one, one like) Damn, she the one
(One, one, one) The one
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
(Love, love, love) Like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
Look up in the mirror like, "Damn, she the one"

(I'm the one)
(I'm the one) You're the one
(I'm the one)
(The one) Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"

(One, one, one)
(One, one, one) Like damn, she the one
(One, one, one)
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
