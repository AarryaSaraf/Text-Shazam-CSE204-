Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?

Huh?

Woo!

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me


I just took a DNA test, and it told me I'm the realest pretty chocolate nigga
Out here with some good dick, no cap
And I can have a bitch from Harvard with a eight-year degree
I prolly still rather pull up where a hood bitch (Let's go), uh
Now she wanna trip on me (For what?)
I was doin' my thing, she was backin' it up
She was puttin' them hips on me
You know your friend with the red heels and attire
You was puttin' them lips on me (Mwah)
And I just keep gettin' lips from 'em
But I know what to do, I put dick on ya
Your friends like to talk 'bout the stuff that I do (Uh-huh)
But your friends wanna fuck on me too (Yeah)
And the way that you treat me, I wanna get even
I'm thinkin' like what should I do? (Hmm)
But I know how you move outta spite
She bigger, I prolly lose in a fight
And I'ma talk my shit but I'm in love with her big fine ass
So I'ma do what she like
She told me


Why're men great 'til they gotta be great? ( What you mean?)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair (My hair)
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (Bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "shoot your shot" when you see 'em
It's okay, he already in my DMs
