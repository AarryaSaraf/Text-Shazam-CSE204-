Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do, and everything you do

In Tulum, we pretend we're married
And that little tiny house was a home
It was so freeing, to know that we made it
To know that I never ever, will be alone

All we had was time
And at the front of my mind
I was so close to leaving the world behind with you, ooh

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)

Going to sleep, holding hands at the sunrise
Waking up, holding hands in the rain
I feel so goofy, I don't really do this
But with you is healing how I feel pain

It made me sad, I cried
Singing Coldplay in the night
Dancing to no music just feels right with you, ooh

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)
And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)

My defense mechanism kicks in
Makes me run, run away from the real
It's easy to cut you down, while I close me up
Instead of telling you how I feel

And we waited so long, but the sex is so good
Five years in the making, didn't know if we would
Do you say this shit to other people? I don't think that I could
I don't think that I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think that I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think I could, I don't think that I could
I don't think I could, I don't think that I could

And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)
And I just know it
That in this life
My love is you (And everything you do)
