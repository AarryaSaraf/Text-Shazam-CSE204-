1 a.m. and the night just keeps on calling (Ooh)
We on demon time until tomorrow morning (Ooh-wee, say less)
Bitch, say less, express yourself
Bitch, get dressed, unstress yourself
It's cold outside, so what, let's take a walk

Tonight, I wanna be
Nobody else (Nobody else)
This costume feels so real
Almost scared myself

Dance the night away (Keep your pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah (It's a happy place in here, baby, you're safe)
We can take our mask off
We can all ball and parlay
I can hardly wait (At 3 a.m. my freak come out the cage)

(Mm, yeah) There's a Mona Lisa moaning in the room (Mmhm)
Tell a sexy nurse to meet me in loo (Ooh, yeah)
Sisters drinking bitches brew
The mister got a monster too (Freaky)
It's getting freaky, do you wanna leave the bar? (Hell no)

Dance the night away (Keep your pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah (It's a happy place in here, baby, you're safe)
We can take our mask off
We can all ball and parlay
I can hardly wait (At 3 a.m. my freak come out the cage)

Pur, bitch

Freaky nights
Crazy times
Let's play dress up, baby

Dance the night away (Keep your pussy poppin', pop those percolates)
Everybody's gay, yeah (It's a happy place in here, baby, you're safe)
We can take our mask off
We can all ball and parlay
I can hardly wait (At 3 a.m. my freak come out the cage)

Pur, bitch
