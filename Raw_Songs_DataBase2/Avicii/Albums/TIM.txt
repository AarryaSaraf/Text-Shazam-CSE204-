// Peace Of Mind //

Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryna catch my breath

Can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind

Relieve, do you need a relieve, do you need a relieve?
Do you need a release, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, can I get a little peace of mind?

Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryna catch my breath

Relieve, do you need a relieve, do you need a relieve?
Do you need a release, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, do you wanna let let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, can I get a little peace of mind?
And a little bit of silence to unwind

Dear society
You are moving way too fast
Way too fast for me
I'm just tryna catch my breath

Relieve, do you need a relieve, do you need a relieve?
Do you need a release, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, do you wanna let let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you let go?
Do you wanna let go, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be free, do you wanna be free?
Do you wanna be, do you wanna let let go?

Can I get a little peace of mind?

// Heaven //

Step out into the dawn
You pray 'til, you pray 'til the lights come on
And then you feel like you've just been born
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I'm beaten and broken up
And now I'm back in the arms I love

And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven, yeah

Beaten and bathed in blood
I'm hit by, I'm hit by your love and drug
And now you've come to raise me up
Oh

And I think I just died
I think I just died
Yeah, I think I just died
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
Oh, and went to heaven

It's such a night, such a beautiful night
It's such a view, such a beautiful sight
I think I just, oh, I think I just died, oh
And went to heaven
And went to heaven
Oh, yeah, yeah

We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh
We're gonna be birds and fly
We're gonna set the world alight
We're gonna lose ourselves tonight, oh

Heaven (Heaven)
Went to heaven
And went to heaven

// SOS //

Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest
Two times clean again, I'm actin' low
A pound of weed and a bag of blow

I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

We could be more than just part-time lovers
We could be more than just part-time lovers

I get robbed of all my sleep
As my thoughts begin to bleed
I'd let go but I don't know how
Yeah, I don't know how, but I need you now

I can feel your love pulling me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers
I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

I can feel your touch picking me up from the underground
And I don't need my drugs, we could be more than just part-time lovers

(We could be) We could be more than just part-time lovers (Part-time lovers)
(Yeah, more than, more than lovers)
We could be more than just part-time lovers

Can you hear me, S.O.S.?
Help me put my mind to rest

// Tough Love //

Weight is on me
Weight is on you
We scream and we fight like there's nothing to lose
End of the day
Come and take my arm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Weight is on you
Weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try
We stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Weight is on you
Weight is on me
Sometimes I'm not who you want me to be
God knows I try
We stumble and we fall
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

Give me tough love
And a lesson to learn
Your tough love
Is what I deserve
Sweet tough love
You're my pretty good luck charm
There's no place I'd rather be than in your arms

// Bad Reputation //

Can you see my emotions
Sinking away in slow motion
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotions?
Say can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea

I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation

I know that you been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake til the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost at sea

I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation

I got a bad reputation

So, you got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care 'bout nothing but me
You got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
Don't care 'bout nothing but me, yeah

I hear what you're saying
I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying
For a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Feeling like I'm down, down, down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me I know
I got a bad reputation

I got a bad reputation

// Ain't A Thing //

I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fuckin' situations
And I swear I never say shit
But this time I'm gonna say it

When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers-on
Can go find themselves another one

But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

Hey, it ain't a thing baby

I swear I'm losing patience
For all of these fuckin' altercations
Yeah and I swear I never say shit
But this time I really mean it

When the record's on the final song
And the parties will be long, long gone
All the pretenders and the hangers-on
Can go find themselves another one

But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

It ain't a thing baby

It ain't a thing baby

It ain't a thing baby

But it ain't a thing, yeah, but it ain't a thing
But it, but it ain't a thing, yeah
But it, but it ain't a thing
It ain't a thing, baby

It ain't a thing baby

But it ain't a thing, ain't a thing

It ain't a thing baby

// Hold The Line //

Crossbows and arrows
The smoke in the shadows
You'll lose your mind
Standing on the battle line
Starting to choke on
Your heart in your throat and it feels just like
You can't remember how to fight

We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart

We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line

Hold the line

Don't hold your hands up it's your final stand off
Put your white flag down
Oh don't you surrender now
No hero's story
There's no blaze of glory
But dawn only comes
At the end of the night

We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart

We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die but we're alive
And while we're here
Hold the line

Hold the line

Hold the line
We don't get to die young
We just have to push on
We don't get to die young
Hold the line

// Freak //

I don't want to be seen in this shape I'm in
I don't want you to see how depressed I've been
You were never the high one
Never wanted to die young
I don't want you to see all the scars within

So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

I keep thinking about what we could of been
If we hadn't been caught in what should of been
Yeah, oh we used to be dancing, never cared about nothing
I don't know when we got all these scars within

So tell me why (Oh why, oh why)
Why am I such a freak?
You're out outta you mind (Oh my, oh my)
Who the fuck are you to judge me?
And I told you I'd be different
And I told you I was wild
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
You're stuck in denial
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

Ooh yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
(Oh why, oh why)
(Oh why, oh why)
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak
(Oh why, oh why)
(Oh why, oh why)
Yeah, I think that maybe you're the freak

// Excuse Me Mr Sir //

Checking, checking, microphone checking
I'll tell you what you need to know
Holla, holla, gotta make a dollar
Time to put on a show
Many, many, one too many
People try to fill my shoes
But, see ya, see ya, see ya 'round later
I'm about to make a move

I'm on a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

I'm a villain, villain 'bout to make a million
One too many records sold (That's why I)
Chillin' while I keep on building
See you fuckers down the road
Better, better, feeling much better
Tonight I'll do it all again (Cop that)
Ticking, ticking, time keeps ticking
I'm rolling out till the end
Bring it back now

I'm on a roller coaster beyond belief
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now
I'm a riot walking down the street
I'm what you need, what you really, really need
'Cause you're always coming back to me
Bring it back now (Yeah)

Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand a word
Your enquirers are none of my concern
Excuse me, Mr. Sir
I don't understand your word
With all due respect, I'll best be on my way

I'm what you need, what you really, really
I'm, I'm what you need, what you really, really

'Cause you're always coming back to me

// Heart Upon My Sleeve //

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, oh, woah

I guess I'm just down on my luck
The beat should get me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck
The beat should get me out of it

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down

Now I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you

Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together (Together)
(Forever)

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken

Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down

// Never Leave Me //

I'm always left out, stranded on the fence
You came along, no ego, no pretense
In a trance we danced and prayed for no tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold, but we were right

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me
She sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me
I hope that she'll never leave me

I'm always left out, chasing innocence
You came along, you showed me what it meant
In the days we raced, yeah dreaming of tomorrow
We were brash and we were bold but we were right

And I reckon we can take our time
And I reckon we can go a while
And I'll be there at the borderline
'Cause I owe you all the best of me

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
I hope that she'll never leave me
(Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
I hope that she'll never leave me

Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me
Never leave me

She knows how I'm feeling
She banishes all my demons
So easy, like breathing
She bandages all my bleeding
She knows how I love her
We take it down undercover
She gets me, she sees me
I hope that she'll never leave me

// Fades Away //

All of the troubled times that we have overcome
All of the trials to find somewhere that we belong
All I know is that with you I'm holding on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

Don't you love it how it all just fades away?
When your clothes don't feel the songs of yesterday
And I can't go back, and I can't go back

Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

All of the tracks we traced we raced to reach the sun
All of the lives to find a place where we belong
All I know is that with you I'm moving on
'Cause all of the days are
All of the days are on the run

And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away
It all just fades away

And I can't go back, and I can't go back
Don't you love it how it all
It all just fades away
