Hearts run right to the end, right to the end, right to the end...

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don't need to be scared,
'Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don't need to be scared,
'Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again

Take a chance on a broken heart 'cause it's starting again
We gotta try even if it's hard, try baby to understand.
To find a rainbow in every storm, you gotta believe.
Don't ever doubt that you do belong now.
'Cause it's starting with you, it's starting with me.

Hearts run right to the end;
You're gonna love, you're gonna love again (love again, love again)
You're gonna love, you're gonna love again.

Hearts run right to the end;
People come now you don't need to be scared,
'Cause you gonna love, you gonna love again.

You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again
You're gonna love, you're gonna love, you're gonna love again
