Every time I see your face
There's a cloud hanging over you
In such a beautiful way
There's a poetry to your solitude

Ooh you should let me love you
Hold me now forevermore
Oh I'll be thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Ooh you should let me love you
Hold me now forevermore
Oh I'll be thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours

And you won't ever have to try
To live by anybody else's rules
It'll be just you and I
Together in the altitude

Ooh you should let me love you
Hold me now forevermore
Oh I'll be thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours
Ooh you should let me love
Hold me now forevermore
Oh I'll be thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours

You should let me love you
Love you
You should let me love you
Love you
