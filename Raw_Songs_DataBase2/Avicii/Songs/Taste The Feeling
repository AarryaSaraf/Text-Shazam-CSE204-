It feels good, in my heart, in my soul
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end
We can watch the waves, have a Coke
and just sit here beside me
I took a little of my heart again

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing

It feels good as we stand on the shore
And our hearts are jumping
I grab another Coke and let's dive in
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

With every fading sunset
We see the stars align
We make the simple moments 
Last for a lifetime

So, we'll feel forever
You and me, together
We can stay forever
And be real together

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing
