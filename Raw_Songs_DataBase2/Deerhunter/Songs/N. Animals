I was born of concrete, born out of chemistry
It comes out of chaos, blooms in infinity
New animals born of concrete, born out of chemistry
New Animals, concrete, born in to circuitry

I was six when six was surface
Yeah, time moves forwards and backwards in currents
I was eight underneath the surface of the Earth which became a furnace
Animals, go

A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history, A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history, A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, you're no use to me)
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry), 
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)

A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)
We are animals, you know us
We are animals, and ghosts
We are animals, you know us
We are animals, you know us
Attack, attack
