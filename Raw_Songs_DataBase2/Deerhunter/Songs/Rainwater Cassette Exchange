Two weeks of misery
Capture my heart and destroy me
Destroy my mind and my body
Invade like a disease and conquer me

My wild exchange could not believe
I know I can't stop breathing
I've seen the light I want to see
I hold the hand that beckoned me

Do you believe in love at first sight?
Oh yes, my son, I did the first time
Oh yes, my son, I did before I died
And now it does me no good here on the other side

I know my ways when other phase
A cold embrace, then all is waste
'Til I can find a new escape
Reborn again in some other place
