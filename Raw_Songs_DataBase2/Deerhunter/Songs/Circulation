Bad circulation
Become impatient
Too long we've waited
For an end for me

Shame on your doctors
Oh, how they fooled us
Oh, how they lured us
Into their trucks, oh

Cold cave in winter
Ice swings would splinter
Ashes and cinder
Caressed and 

Done with the highlights
Mirror wives and low lives
And reach for my light
When it gets dark
