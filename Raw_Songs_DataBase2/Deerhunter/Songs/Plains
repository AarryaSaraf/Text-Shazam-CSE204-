I was listening to the trains
I was up all night
And something glistened in the strange
Blood diffuse light
My friend was missing
And I was ghost
I was flame, I was bright
I was listening to the trains
I was up all night

Oh, James
You've got no reason to stay
In these plains

I was racing against time
With this friend of mine
Collapsing just before
We reached the end of the line
He was lifting diamonds straight
Straight was cold, cold was black
And black was glistening
All the night the sound remained

Oh, James
You've got no reason to stay
In these plains
These plains
Are barren and hateful to rain
And what remains
Is the sound of trains
