I was in the pi- scented -otograph
Laying on the cold -d
And the boundary was spreading like disea-se
Like disea-e
And there were no boundaries left to cross
Only the space imagined from due discou-rse
I was in the boundary
Abducted by border guards in the
Back country road
Back country road

Ba-need
Oh, oh, there were no, no atmospheric devices
There were no -d out and the basement was so moldy and wet
Mildew spread like spider webs on these
Back, back, ba-
-ountry road
