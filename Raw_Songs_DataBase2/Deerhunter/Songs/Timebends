I feel nothing, no pride or joy
But no pain or discomfort
I'm made this way by chemical choice
It's an action for protection
And I'm this way and you're that way

I need the way, admission's never free
Until you admit to me you're lost

I was made this way, the future is ours
I'm a superman and you are my arch
I'll be this way when you are in your grave
Don't test me, I'm so dangerous

I need the way, admission's never free
Until you admit to me you're lost

I need the way, admission's never free
Until you admit to me you're lost

I feel nothing, no pride or joy
But no pain or discomfort
I'm made this way by chemical choice
It's an action for protection
And I'm this way and you're that way

I scare myself...
