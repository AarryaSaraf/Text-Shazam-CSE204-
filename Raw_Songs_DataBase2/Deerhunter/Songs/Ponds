Jumping
Your hands are like ice picks
You're the king of rich kids
Just once

Creation of deathly
You're the king of rich kids
Your dreams are x-rated
You're seduced by credit cards

Ponds like hands grow

Jumping
You're the king of rich kids
And your dreams are X-rated
Seduced by sports car, middle run

Jumping
You're the dream of rich kids
Tranced by basements
Box of, no, no
Box of old junk

Ponds like hands grow
