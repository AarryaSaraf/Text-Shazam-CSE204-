So I woke up in a radio freeze
Occupied by a
Couple of girls I knew from
Way back when where

Oh, I had my face like the ocean
So I'd radiate but
Too much radiation
I walk around like a walker

Always choosing where to go
And where to be
Oh, radiation
Oh, radiation

Oh, so long
Oh, so long, so long

So long loneliness, so long loneliness
So long loneliness, so long, so long

So long, yeah, so long, yeah
So long, yeah, so long

So far from home, so far from home
So far from home, so far from home
