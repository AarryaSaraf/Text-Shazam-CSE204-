I woke up
In the middle of the night
I called out
I called your name

Patiently, patiently

I called out

Why do I dream
So often of
His body when
His body will decay

His flesh will be fluorescent grey
His flesh will be fluorescent grey

Patiently, patiently

You were my god
You were my god in high school

People never really know

Patiently, Patiently
