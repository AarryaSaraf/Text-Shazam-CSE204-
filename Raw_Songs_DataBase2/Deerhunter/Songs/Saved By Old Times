Mrs. Hemmings was OAO
Pretty soon we were all OAO
We were captured by Victorian vampires
With elaborate designs, with elaborate designs

This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO

We are a Romanian sound collage (old black bandit)
Searching for the ghost of past  (I can't stand it)
But this futile coffin will not let us gain entry (I'm your planet, old black bandit)
Into the immortal soul of the redneck (I can't stand it)
You are trapped in your basement for a war of 16 years (I'm your planet, old black bandit)
To combat prevention and in combat with yourself
We are in combat with these cultural vampires
We were trapped in the basement
We were trapped in the basement of the fucking teenage halfway hell

I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times

I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
