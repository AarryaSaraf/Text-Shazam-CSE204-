Album: FadingFrontier

// All The Same //

My home, anywhere expect no comforts save for air
Take it anyway I could leave or I could stay
Wouldn't matter much to me, much to me
My home, it's so cold, air-conditioned to the bone
Take me anywhere, I could see a light out there
I could see a light up these, a light up these
A light up these, a light up these

It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same

My friend's dad got bored, changed his sex and had no more
No more wife, no more kids, nothing left
To live with to exist, so, so, so, so
You should take your handicaps, channel them and feed them back
Till they become your strengths, hollowed out it's all the same

It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same
It's all the same, it's all the same, it's all the same

// Living My Life //

I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life

I'm off the grid, I'm out of range
And the amber waves of grain are turning grey again
The darkened stage and the infinite waves
Distance can change fate, I'm out of range again

And I'm living my life, I'm living my life

Will you tell me when you find out how to conquer all this fear
I've been spending too much time out on the fading frontier
Will you tell me when you find out how to recover the lost years
I've spent all of my time chasing a fading frontier

I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm off the grid (I'm living my life)
I'm out of range (I'm living my life)
And the amber waves of grain (I'm living my life)
Are turning grey again (I'm living my life)
The darkened stage (I'm living my life)
And the infinite waves (I'm living my life)
Distance can change fate (I'm living my life)
It's happening again (I'm living my life)
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life
I'm living my life, I'm living my life

// Breaker //

Christ
Or credit
What's the price?
What's the edit?
I'm alive
I don't credit
The source
I just drive
And then the fog rolls in
And then they're blind
My enemies
They're just trying
Trying to kill me

Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
I can't seem to stem
The tide and though I try
I try

Try me two touch

I've got the time
And it's been too long
Since I've been
Driving all night
On the back roads winding
Under the stars
That are slowly dying
Oh no

Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
The ocean is strong
I cannot stem the tide
Breaking the waves
Again and though I try
I can't seem to stem
The tide and though I try
I try

Jack-knifed
On the side-street crossing
I'm still alive
And that's something
And when I die
There will be nothing to say
Except I tried
Not to waste another day
Trying to stem the tide

// Duplex Planet //

I don't ever want to go
Back again to the old folks' home
I don't want to have to stay
Where they don't remember love's adjacent home

But I've seen you
You looked right through me
Those ropes can't keep you away
There's no ropes on Tuesdays

Dreaming on the way to work
Dreaming all the way across the road

Don't you see
In your head you will fall asleep
And then you won't remember me
And then you won't remember me

I'm out of memory
I'm losing shape
After the body's gone
The scent remains
And down the hall
The time's erased
You'll find they're gone
Without a trace

// Take Care //

Take care
Lift the guard and you might find
Your place in that life
A place where you found hope

There's nothing more than the fog from the dry ice burning
Corpses turning

Take care
Lift the guard you won't be lonely
Too much longer
Too much longer…

Raise your crippled hand into the clouds and
Wave bye bye now
Wave bye bye bye

Raise your hands around and you can't tell it's the last thing you'll see
Last thing you'll play
Hopeless when you call "Hi! Hi."
What is it you're after? don't just stand there

Oh…
Oh

// Leather And Wood //

I believe my head is on straight
I've been given this chance
To make things great
I believe I can focus
Reel in the air
I know I can
I can

I believe the sun will rise
In the east now
I believe we will find
That elusive peace now
I can't believe there is
No hope

I drove my car over the edge
The leather and the wood
Formed a ledge

I believe we can fly
I believe anything is real
I believe we can die
I believe we can live again

// Snakeskin //

I was born already nailed to the cross
I was born with a feeling, I was lost
I was born with the ability to talk
I was born with a snake-like walk

I was trippin' now on a city cloak
They were separated then with sunlight shrouds
I was born with a crippled man on my back
I was natural, I was geographic black

I was dreaming of a man with a neon back
I was dreaming of a man with a heart attack
I lost my marbles all over the pink, pink cage
I tried to find a cable that was engaged

I was lost in that home for the aged and lonely
I cried and I choked, I was sick and I was boney
I was feelin' kinda ill, I was feelin' kinda lonely
And time was erased, yes but, I was so homely

// Ad Astra //

Many years ago
I happened on a place
The shadows hanging low
I could make out his face
In an ancient mist
They gazed into the flame
Around a dying one
They chanted out a name

They looked up to the sky
Reciting ancient rites
The trees began to sway
Bathed in fluorescent light
The embers in their eyes
Fixed on the living dead
Motionless he rests
His skin was glowing red

"And as sure as we stand
When we call
With our four hands
For the one from above
Who will heal us
With a touch"

I wish I was a mole in the ground
Yes, I wish I was a mole in the ground
If I's a mole in the ground I'd root that mountain down
And I wish I was a mole in the ground

// Carrion //

Even though you're gone I still carry on
It's the same big sea, it's the same to me
To carry on, carry on I will stay strong, I will stay strong
I set you free, I set you free, now run along, now run along
In the midnight hour I will lose my power
I will dig my hole, I will become a mole
In the ground, in the ground, it's much too deep, it's much too deep

What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

Everywhere I go I'm reminded
Long ago, it's so long ago
But it won't leave, please, leave me, leave me alone, I am along
Deep in the ground, looking around trying to find my home, trying to find a home
But I dug too deep, I dug too deep, I cannot see, I cannot see

What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?

Even though you're gone I still carry on
It's the same big sea, it's the same to me
