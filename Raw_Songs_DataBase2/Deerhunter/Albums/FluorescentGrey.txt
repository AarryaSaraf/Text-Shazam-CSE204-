Album: FluorescentGrey

// Fluorescent Grey //

I woke up
In the middle of the night
I called out
I called your name

Patiently, patiently

I called out

Why do I dream
So often of
His body when
His body will decay

His flesh will be fluorescent grey
His flesh will be fluorescent grey

Patiently, patiently

You were my god
You were my god in high school

People never really know

Patiently, Patiently

// Dr. Glass //

In the world
So many
Useless bodies
So much traffic

In the world
So many
Useless bodies
Please consider

All the couples kissing
The children missing
The corpses rotting
In the cities spotting the globe

In the world
So many
Useless bodies
So much sorrow

All the couples kissing
The children missing
The corpses rotting
In the cities spotting the globe

In the world
So many
Useless bodies
So much sorrow

All the couples kissing
The children missing
The corpses rotting
In the cities spotting the globe

// Like New //

I opened up my aim
I put cotton to flame
I saw the city lanes
Mirrored in falling rain

Seems like new
Seems like new

And so the skeletons
Had left their work undone
Nowhere to hide their skin
Back to the crypt again

Be like you
Be like you

// Wash Off //

We had some conflicts
With Prince Erudite
Laid out on spreadsheets
And

In the parking lot
Of my high school
Cheap acid
Soft focus

I was sixteen
I was sixteen
I was sixteen
I was sixteen

And in the parking lot
Of my high school
Cheap acid
Soft focus

And in the parking lot
Of my high school
Cheap acid
Soft focus

I was sixteen
I was sixteen
I was sixteen
I was sixteen
