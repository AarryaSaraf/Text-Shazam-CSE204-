Album: Monomania

// Neon Junkyard //

Finding the fluorescence in the junk
By night illuminates the day
Finding ancient language in the blood
Fading a little more each day

And if you've got a lot of pain
You remember how to speak
And if you gather all the rain
Yeah it's still coming down in sheets

Neon rust puts color in the blood
Call upon the words to speak
Everything is the same as it was
But now there's nothing left to change

And if you gather it you won't
Be drowned by rain
And if you memorize the words
They will show you the way

// Leather Jacket II //

Well I was sick and dangerous
I am the queen of bass
And I was suffering
But I was a regular

Bored to death
Then I was luck I was arrested
I would make an arrest
I threw the blood spots
Across the moon

I was just bones
Yeah I barely tried
They always cut my head off

My life in blood
If you come on back
Maybe I'd scream
I'd take one last shot
But my one and only
Left me here to die
I was a goldmine
I was cult
I was too kind
I was too kind
I was a goldmine

// The Missing //

Open up my thoughts
tell me if you see
some meaning.
Take me all apart.
So that I can see
the pieces.

And I could walk for miles.
And on every street
is the same scene.
Follow the telephone wires
until I feel this air beneath me.

Oh and if you don't mind,
would you show to me
the missing?
With my weak eyes
I would only see
the missing.

Open up my thoughts
Tell me if you see some meaning.
Take me all apart,
So that I can see the bleeding.

Oh if you don't mind,
could you show to me
the missing?
With my weak eyes
I would only see
the missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.
The missing.

And I would understand
(I could understand)
if you show to me
the missing.

And I could understand
(I could understand)
if you showed to me
the missing.

And I would understand
(I could understand)
if you show to me
the missing.

// Pensacola //

Take me on a trip, man
I'll never get sick
Take wherever you go
and I won't complain along the way
Well I've been waiting so long
to say bye! bye! bye!
This town ain't give me nothing but
bald head and trouble

Well if it can't be better,
if it can't be tried
Doesn't matter much boy
and I will dry me eyes
I could be your boyfriend
or I could be your shame
'Till I see your eyes and
they're filled with pain

I came from the delta down to the bay
well I came from the delta right through plains
right through the plains

I came from the delta
down to the plains
when I got back home
there was nothing I'd arranged
the woman that I love had
took another man
well nothing ever ends up
quite like what you planned

Take me to the Central station
and I'll jump on board of that bus the long way
Time to take my trip
give me that ticket man
straight to Pensacola
Straight to Pensacola, straight to Pensacola straight to Pensacola...

// Dream Captain //

Dream captain take me on your ship
I've been feeling like I'm goona be sick
I've been landlocked for too many weeks
I've been feeling like I'm weak, yeah

I'm a poor boy from a poor family
There's nobody left to take care of me, so

Dream captain take me on your ship
Dream captain take me if you wish
I'll do anything that you need
There's nothing that's left of me

I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I can see where I come from easily
I don't need anybody to tell me what I'm worth
I've already been giving up from my birth

Could you be, for me, what I see in you
Or would you give me wings so I could fly, fly, or sink and die please!

Dream captain take me on your ship
If you feel that I am fit
To belong in the company grip
I want to be on the company ship

I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I ain't got nobody left to take care of me
I can't feel any of my extremities
They're going numb
and I don't know how long I can breathe

Dream captain take me on your ship
It's my only, my only wish
I can do whatever you command
I'm a boy, man
and you're a man, man

I'm a poor boy from a poor family
I ain't got nobody left to take care of me
I'm a poor boy, I'm so dirty
I'm a poor boy, well look into my eyes, look into my eyes...

// Blue Agent //

When your range is off
When you call that complete
Your finished task was a burden
I'll give you that to concede

If you wear a mask
If you wear a badge
If you're lost in the curtains of time
You'll be erased

Sleep tight, gold night
Protect my brain
I was bright, I was right
All the time

If you ever need to talk
I won't be around
If you ever need to fight for life
I'll make no sound

I completed your task
It was much too tough
Your burdens now were twice removed
It must be rough

I use my golden light to find a way
Your bones they were always, they were always in my way
The fire finds a way to completely erase
I followed you out
You threw up and you complained
And I bide my time, and I hide my glory away
In the basement room where you used to kneel and pray

If you need a friend now
Better look some place else
You burned this bridge long ago
Here's to your health
I'm a blue light, I'm a crippled coward
Shining out in the night
The sky is clearer now that I'm filled with fright

// T.H.M. //

I tried to keep him straight
Ever since the day he was born
He came out a little late
Maybe that's where frustration's born

My head was like a wound
When they called me and said
"it's happened much too soon"
Took two bullets to the brain
My kid brother, he was insane
Was insane

When you find a way
Call and tell me when the time's erased
I had no cause to be awake
The phone rang, it was 3am
Oh it was T.H.M.
Where is T.H.M?

Ever since I was born
I have felt so forlorn
I always knew this day would come
Hey you lose and you win some

T.H.M.
T.H.M.
T.H.M.
T.H.M.

// Sleepwalking //

I'm not mad about anything
You forced on me a hopeless dream
I'd been looking for one true thing
Too numb to see I'd been sleepwalking

Too horrified to see

When a decade doesn't get you down
You're flying now but you'll come back down
And with both your feet on the ground
You'll look around, yeah, you'll look around

Too horrified to see

I'd been looking for some harmonies
Some words to sing that could really bring
The lonely-hearted some company
All the people that were just like me, yeah
When a decade is spent searching
For something time will never bring
Something starts to shut down inside
My body and my tired mind

Too horrified to see

Can't you see
Your heart is hard now
Your heart is hard now
Can't you see
We've grown apart now
We've grown apart now

// Back To The Middle //

Back to the middle
This is where love has left me
It's an endless cycle
Please don't take it away from me

Look at me
Your hair is falling out now
Your two by four
You left me doubting

Back in the middle
Everyone knows your name now
It's all accidental
Your love is such a sick, sick game

How could he?
The basic way you used me
Why does it have to be so brutal?

Back in the middle
Take me where I can see some stars
Take me to your cabin
Like you promised so many times

You and me
You broke free
You broke me
And you left me these little pieces

// Monomania //

My only boy couldn't leave his lady well
Come on boy let me tell you that
If you wanna be with me
I can be your home away

Come on god hear my sick prayer
If you can't send me an angel
If you can't send me an angel
Send me something else instead

Send my heart to the sea
Oh the empty sea
Well there's a light in the core
And there's nothing left no more
No more no

If you can't choose me
If you can't see
Well there's a light in my heart
And it' won't be there tomorrow

There is a man
There is a mystery whore
And in my dying days
I can never be sure
Well never mind
And then they take me away
And then they take you away
They'll never take me away
And in my mind
There is something rotting dead
I can't compete with her
Let me be released from this

Mono-monomania

// Nitebike //

I was spinning my big wheels
They were stuck and I was stuck to them
The night was clear
and I was queer
And I was only of age one year

I was on the cusp of a breakthrough
When they took me out
and stuck it in
It went so deep, man
it leaves scars you relate to
Are only burdens to me

I was a dream, a dream, a dream of my self
I was no longer in good health

Have you ever been here?
Or someplace else you can relate to
Out of fear,
out of trials and error

I was no longer mine
I had pantomimed
I had felt for lights
I had grown to find
I had no place in mind
When I began to drive
No destination
No destination

You can feel my pain?
You want to relate,
you want to stay

I was feeling real bad
And I had found all my problems
I had found all my problems
They came flying up to me

// Punk (La Vie Ant√©rieure) //

For a month I was punk
I remembered all my drunk
Younger days in a daze
I would spend my empty days

For a week I was weak
I was humbled on my knees
Pray to God: "Make it stop
Help me find some relief"

For a year I was queer
I had conquered all my fears
Not alone anymore
But I found it such a bore

For a month I was punk
For a month I had no luck
For a drunk I was young
For a kid right to the

For a month I was punk
I remembered all my junk
Younger days in a daze
I would spend my useless days

For a week I was weak
I was down on my knees
Pray to God: "Make it stop
Help me find some relief"

For a month I was punk
For a month I was
