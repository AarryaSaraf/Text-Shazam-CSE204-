// N. Animals //

I was born of concrete, born out of chemistry
It comes out of chaos, blooms in infinity
New animals born of concrete, born out of chemistry
New Animals, concrete, born in to circuitry

I was six when six was surface
Yeah, time moves forwards and backwards in currents
I was eight underneath the surface of the Earth which became a furnace
Animals, go

A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history, A-B-C-D, we've got no history
A-B-C-D, we've got no history, A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, you're no use to me)
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry), 
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)
A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)

A-B-C-D, we've got no history (A-B-C-D, we've got no chemistry)
We are animals, you know us
We are animals, and ghosts
We are animals, you know us
We are animals, you know us
Attack, attack

// Adorno //

I lived twice after my suicide
In the future or the past, I could not decide
Which one I hate the most
My body has become a sacramental host

When you're once the son of god and you're still unemployed
Offered up salvation, surrender to the void
Perspectives crushed
I might be living in two places at once

Cross these world, it's self-destructive

So am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Tales, cross, tales, cross
Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Tales, cross, tales, cross
Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Tales, cross, tales, cross
Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Tales, cross, tales, cross

No subside, I attempted suicide
I could not die, no matter how hard I tried
So I was bored
I wanted to die, so I spilled out on the ground
They put me in a hospital, they said I need to rest
After all, now father knows best for all
I can't say
Tales speak day after day

Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Am I sleeping on a floor or am I nailed to a cross
Tales, cross, tales, cross

Tales, cross, tales, cross

(Self-destructive)
(So self-destructive)

// Tech School //

No cigarette breaks, no sex, parking lot
Play by weakness, play academic rock

Tech school
Tech school

So sick of tech school, can't play by the rules
Vacate forum, no sex, bus stop

Tech School
Tech School
Tech School

No cigarette breaks, no sex, parking lot
Play academic rock

Tech school, drop out

No pornography, rebuild history
Fight for the family, restore heredity

Tech school
So sick of tech school
So sick of tech school

I want university
Where they rebuild culture in their sleep

Tech school, drop out

He sits by the TV, he's history
He sits by the TV, he's history
He sits by the TV, he's history
He sits by the TV, he's history

No cigarette breaks, no sex, parking lot
Play by weakness, play academic rock

Tech school

So sick of tech school, can't play by the rules
I want university where they rebuild culture in their sleep

Tech school, drop out

// Ponds //

Jumping
Your hands are like ice picks
You're the king of rich kids
Just once

Creation of deathly
You're the king of rich kids
Your dreams are x-rated
You're seduced by credit cards

Ponds like hands grow

Jumping
You're the king of rich kids
And your dreams are X-rated
Seduced by sports car, middle run

Jumping
You're the dream of rich kids
Tranced by basements
Box of, no, no
Box of old junk

Ponds like hands grow

// Oceans //

Oceans of time

Oceans of time connect
Each go to a death

Oceans of death

// Basement //

What's in the basement
Cool trick
It's twilight now
No fake shit

What's in the basement
Cool trick
Superimpose
Twilight effect

What's in the basement
What's in the basement
I'm in the basement

What's in the basement
I'm in the basement
With quick focus

What's in the basement
Cool trick
It's twilight now
No fake shit

Rained on youth
Soaked to skin
You're absent
Sent back again
You're absent youth
Rained on youth
Soaked to skin bruised
Black and blue refuged
Cobwebbed stripped and mildewed

I don't want to go down
I don't want to go down
You don't want to go down
You don't want to go down

I don't want to go down
You don't want to go down

What's in the basement
You're half naked

I don't want to go down
You don't want to go down
I don't want to go down
You don't want to go down

Basement
Basement
Basement
Basement

You're in the basement

Quick quick focus
Quick quick focus

You're in the basement
You're half naked

I'm in the basement
You're half naked

Basement
Basement
Basement
