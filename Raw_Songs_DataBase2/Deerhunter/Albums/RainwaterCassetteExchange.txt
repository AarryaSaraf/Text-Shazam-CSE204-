Album: RainwaterCassetteExchange

// Rainwater Cassette Exchange //

Two weeks of misery
Capture my heart and destroy me
Destroy my mind and my body
Invade like a disease and conquer me

My wild exchange could not believe
I know I can't stop breathing
I've seen the light I want to see
I hold the hand that beckoned me

Do you believe in love at first sight?
Oh yes, my son, I did the first time
Oh yes, my son, I did before I died
And now it does me no good here on the other side

I know my ways when other phase
A cold embrace, then all is waste
'Til I can find a new escape
Reborn again in some other place

// Disappearing Ink //

I got a message
Can you guess what it said?
Drive alone
Drive straight home

I did as instructed
Closed my door and locked it
Disappearing ink
But the words still sting

Sat and wrote a letter
I described the weather
And the scene
Remembering

I forget tomorrow
All sickness and sorrow
Disappearing ink
But the words still sting

What was I thinking?
What was I thinking?

// Famous Last Words //

Ollie off the sidewalk
Watch your brother bleeding

Take him by the hand and
Lead him to the slipstream

Famous last words
Famous last words
Famous last words
Famous last words

Bring you to the vortex
Watch your skin erupting

Nothing can be said now
Nothing can be changed, oh

Famous last words
Famous last words
Famous last words
Famous last words

// Game Of Diamonds //

No one ever talked to me
Now I've forgotten how to speak
A problem with my chemistry
Now I can't sleep and I won't eat

As soft as a strangers hand
I counted every grain of sand
I walked every inch of land, I know

So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know

No one ever walked with me
I got so tired on my feet
I lay drunk on the bowery
Time never meant much to me

As soft as a strangers hand
I counted every grain of sand
I walked every inch of land, I know

So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know

So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know
So strong, I know

// Circulation //

Bad circulation
Become impatient
Too long we've waited
For an end for me

Shame on your doctors
Oh, how they fooled us
Oh, how they lured us
Into their trucks, oh

Cold cave in winter
Ice swings would splinter
Ashes and cinder
Caressed and [?]

Done with the highlights
Mirror wives and low lives
And reach for my light
When it gets dark
