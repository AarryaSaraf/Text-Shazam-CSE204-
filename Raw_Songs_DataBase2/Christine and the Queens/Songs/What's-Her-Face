How their soft skin brings me pain
For each team has its captain
Sun straight down as the game is done
Proudly tired, out of breath for some
It's been years since that playground
It's been years since that playground

My bubblin' face, tangled hair
Like gloomy thoughts to separate
Recreation looks easy for some
Nosebleeds dismissed with a cruel harm
It's been years since that playground
It's been years since that playground

I'm forever what's-her-face (ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)

Eyes closed and fast pace (ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)

It was hard to remember
So my name became a slur
A-more-or-less giving a fine strum
Singing for sure, singing for none
And that is why tonight I won't come
And that is why tonight I won't come

Their beads had ringing appeal
If I'm not sick, that's how I feel
See the dreamer, she's out to be found
Seek the dreamer, she's out to be found
It's been years since that playground
It's been years since that playground

I'm forever what's-her-face (ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)

Eyes closed and fast pace (ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)
(Ever ever, ever ever)
