Oh, oh-oh, oh, hmm

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah?

Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
And now it's open, I can't do no more

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh, baby)

(Look) Look into my eyes (Look into my eyes), can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page a mystery (It's a mystery, ah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh, baby)

(Look) Look into my eyes (Look into my eyes), can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
Oh, oh-oh
Come on, come on, come on
Look, look into my eyes
Oh would I lie? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Would I lie, baby? (Look, look into my eyes)
Oh, would I lie? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
I would never lie to you, I would never lie to you
Look, look into my eyes (Look into my eyes)
I am not that man (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Look into my eyes (Oh, oh yeah)
I would never lie to you
