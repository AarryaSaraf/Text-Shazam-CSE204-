Night 52 was the cruelest of those nights
Would have been easier to just pick a fight
Would have been easier to just pick a fight
Hey yeah

White
And then suddenly a hint of blood, a shout
You were turning down your face, I held you tight
You were turning down your face, I held you tight (hey yeah, ooh)

I want it open
So cut it open
Cut it open so you could see through it
And now I'm lace-like
Now I'm lace-like
Now I'm lace-like for the rain to come through

I try
Not to live with all the numbers you shed
But I fail
Again
Cause 52's stuck in my head

One
On the 23rd of them we lived as one
We were winded but nothing had come undone
We were winded but nothing had come undone (hey yeah)

From
Forty one, I can only recall your palms
It was you who said "no mercy for bygones"
It was you who said "no mercy for bygones"
(Hey yeah, ooh)

I want it open
So cut it open
Cut it open so you could see through me
And now I'm lace-like
Now I'm lace-like
Now I'm lace-like for the rain to come through

I try
Not to live with all the numbers you shed
But I fail
Again
Cause 52's stuck in my head

I try
Not to live with all the numbers you shed
But I fail
Again
Cause 52's stuck in my head
