Don't you dare
Ask of the world to stop
Just as you leave

Don't you dare
Let the substances drop
When I could grieve

I woke up
Blinded by heavy skies
Birds flying low

Don't you dare
Biting me once again
It already shows (It already shows)
It already shows (It already shows)
It already shows (Already shows)

You say you love me?
Hmm, and now I doubt it
Cause you're after something you can have
Cause you want just something you can have
Cause you love only what you can have

You say you love me?
Hmm, and now I doubt it
Cause you're after something you can have
Cause you want just something you can have
And then I disappear in your arms

When I dared
To forgive you through my pain
You punished me more

And my strength
Turns yet against myself
As you stay on the shore

If they're crying then you must be king
I kneeled for my god

I guess I need to turn all of those tears
Into solid gold (It's just solid gold)

You say you love me?
Hmm, and now I doubt it
Cause you're after something you can have
Cause you want just something you can have
Cause you love only what you can have

You say you love me?
Hmm, and now I doubt it
Cause you're after something you can have
Cause you want just something you can have
And then I disappear in your arms

In the cries of you, dear
In the fountain of you, dear
In the river of you, dear

You say you love me
In the cries of you, dear
You say you love me
In the river of you, dear
You say you love me
In the sea of you, dear
