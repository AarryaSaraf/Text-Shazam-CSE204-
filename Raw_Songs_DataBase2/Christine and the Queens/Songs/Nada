Nada

Why is it done in a day? (Why is it done in a day?)
First you give me so much and rot away
Why am I the one who leaves? (Why am I the one who leaves?)
On my way out a little, the tiniest seed

Feelings are lost and mine are overrated
Coming to dust, nothing's here protected
Feelings of loss, am I overrated?
If we are done

Nada
Never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Never back again
Pasa, pasa, pasa nada
Nada
Never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Never back again
Oh, pasa, pasa, pasa nada
Pasa, pasa, pasa nada
(Nada, pasa, pasa, pasa nada)

Why are you hurting?
Tell me why you're hurting?
Hands on the floor - wait
Why is he just grinning?
Hiding in showers
It must be for something
If not for love

Nada, never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Nada, never back again
Oh, pasa, pasa, pasa nada
Never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Nada, never back again
Oh, pasa, pasa, pasa nada

Nada, never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Nada, never back again
Oh, pasa, pasa, pasa nada
Nada, never back again
Never ever, ever coming back again
Nada, never back again
Oh, pasa, pasa, pasa nada

Never back again
Never back again, oh
Pasa, pasa, pasa nada
Never back again, oh
Oh
