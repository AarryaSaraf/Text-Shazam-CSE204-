I miss my mother
Miss my mother
Miss my mother at night
Ooh, she gave me life

I miss my brother
Miss my brother
Miss my brother all day
Ooh, we used to pray

I miss my lover
Miss my lover
Miss my lover at night
Ooh, to hold me tight

I'm on the freeway
On the freeway
On the freeway I cry
Because I can

Tears can be
So good for those who dive in them
Let them run on my cheeks
One more time

Tears are so soft
When you dive in them
Oh, let them sail

I miss my friends
I miss my friends
I miss my friends and the tenderness
Ooh, they give me cold hard looks now

I miss my joy
I miss my joy
I miss my joy and my head
Look at my face
What is happening now?

Tears can be
So good for those who dive in them
Oh, let them roll girl, yeah

Love is like this
Embrace when you can
'Cause at night
When you're all alone you think about it one more time

Oh let's embrace them when we can
Oh, sing my heart out
Tears can be so good let me pray
Oh, let me pray for my salvation, baby, now water
More water
I don't want more money, more water
More

Oh, water
More water
I don't want your money
Water
Is what I'm looking for

Tears can be so good for you, baby
Dive in it
And forget it all
Tears can be so good, let them
Roll on your face, girl
Oh, diamonds
On your face forever
