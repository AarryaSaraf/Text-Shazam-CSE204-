She will come whenever I call her
But she'll leave as soon as I sigh
She's got the eyes of a child
And she'll love without any sorrow
For she just aims for the light
She's got the eyes of a child

She'll forgive and she'll be forgiven
For she's got the eyes of a child

And I love her because she's so brave
And I hate her because she fights
She's got the eyes of a child
What she wants, she always seems to have
What she hates, she just let it dies
She's got the eyes of a child

She forgot but I won't forget her
She's got the eyes of a child

What is it that's so bright about her
That made me so full of lies
She's got the eyes of a child
I recall I've never felt that young
She stole what's left of my heart
She's got the eyes of a child

I wish that I never met her
But she's got the eyes of a child

And I wish I never met her
She's got the eyes of a child
