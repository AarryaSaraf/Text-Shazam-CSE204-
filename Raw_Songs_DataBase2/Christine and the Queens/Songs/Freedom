I won't let you down
Will not give you up
Can I have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
'Cause I would really, really love to stick around
Oh, yes
(I want)

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be (Didn't know what I wanted to be)
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me (And I guess it was enough for me)

To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (Rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
I think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
(I think it's time I told you so)
There's something deep inside of me
(There's someone else I've got to be)
Take back your picture in a frame
(Take back your singing in the rain)
I just hope you understand
(Sometimes the clothes do not make the man)

Say, baby
All we have to do now (Now)
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I (Don't belong to you)
And you don't (Don't belong to me) yeah

Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
You've got to give what you take
(It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom
('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
You've got to give what you take
To the bridge

Well, it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

(That's what you get)
That's what you get
(That's what you get)
I say that's what you get
(That's what you get for changing your mind)
That's what you get for changing my mind
(That's what you get)
I say that's what you get
(That's what you get)
And I just hope you understand
(Sometimes the clothes do not make the man)

Oh, all we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I (Don't belong to you)
Oh, and you (Don't belong to me) yeah, yeah
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got

Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
Freedom (Oh yeah)
Freedom (Oh yeah, I wanna be free)
Freedom (Oh yeah, a free man looking at you, can't you see?)
Freedom (Oh yeah)
Freedom
Freedom
(You got to give what you take)

You got to hold on
'Cause now I've got to live
