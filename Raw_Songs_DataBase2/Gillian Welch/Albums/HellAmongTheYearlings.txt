// Caleb Meyer //

Caleb Meyer, he lived alone
In them hollarin' pines
He made a little whiskey for himself
Said it helped to pass the time

On one evening in back of my house,
Caleb came around
And he called my name 'til I came out
with no one else around

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
but when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

Where's your husband, Nellie Kane
Where's your darling gone?
Did he go on down the mountain side
and leave you all alone?

Yes, my husband's gone to Bowlin' Green
to do some business there.
Then Caleb threw that bottle down 
and grabbed me by my hair.

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
but when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

He threw me on the needle bed,
and on my dress he lay
he held my hands above my head
and I commenced to pray.

I cried My God, I am your child
send your angels down
Then feelin' with my fingertips,
the bottle neck I found

I pulled that glass across his neck
as fine as any blade,
and I felt his blood run fast and hot
around me where I laid.

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
But when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

Caleb Meyer, your ghost is gonna
wear them rattlin' chains.
But when I go to sleep at night,
Don't you call my name

// Good Til Now //

Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down.
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down.
Goodbye, darling, I been good till now.

I went walking with a girl as pure as milk.
I went walking with a girl pure as milk.
Standing on the corner, sweating through a yellow silk.

Rocks in my pocket and a devil on my back.
Rocks in my pockets and a devil on my back.
You won't even come across the tracks.

Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down.
Balled out wasted and I feel I'm going down.
Goodbye, darling, I been good till now.

// The Devil Had A Hold Of Me //

Now I was just a girl of two
Now I was just a girl of two
With a golden heart and a button shoe

The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me

There was something wrong with the butcher's boy
Was something wrong with the butcher's boy
He trembled in his hand and voice

The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
The others knew to let him be
But the devil had a hold of me

Now the tailpipe spit and the engine roared
The tailpipe spit and the engine roared
I's waving out the Plymouth door

And the devil had a hold of me 
The devil had a hold of me
The old folks saw the last they'd see
The devil had a hold of me

I dreamed last night that my time was done
I dreamed last night that my time was done
And my soul flew up to the holy son

But the devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I snapped back down when he pulled my lead
The devil had a hold of me

There're those who'll laugh and not believe
There're those who'll laugh and not believe
Until you feel that touch upon your sleeve

The devil had a hold of me
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me
I turned my head and I could see
The devil had a hold of me

// My Morphine //

I looked around and all up and down
I never wasted time on two or three
There's only one girl for me

There was a time she used to treat me fine
But lately she's been acting awful stoned
Makes a man weep alone

eye dee oh lay ee tee
eye dee leeldle odle ay oo ee tee
eye dee oh lee tee
lee tee
deedle ohdle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

You should have seen me and my Morphine
When we used to go dancing in the war
Spin me right off the floor

eye dee oh lay ee tee
eye dee leeldle odle ee odle ee tee
eye dee odle ee tee
lee tee
deedle odle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

Morphine, Morphine, what made you so mean?
You never used to do me like you do
Where's that sweet gal i knew?

eye dee oh lee tee
eye dee leedle odle ay odle ay tee
eye dee oh lay tee
lee tee
deedle odle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

My Morphine

// One Morning //

One mornin', one mornin' as work I begun
What did I see ridin' out of the sun
On the road from Lexington

One rider, one rider beatin' the breeze
Down on his saddle, low to his knees
Comin' through my willow trees

Now closer, the terrible work of the gun
Was stiffened and black where his blood all had run
But I knew my wayward son

One mornin', one mornin' the boy of my breast
Came to my door unable to rest
Even in the arms of death

// Miner's Refrain //

In the black dust towns of east Tennessee 
All the work's about the same
And you may not go to the job in the ground 
But you learn the miner's refrain

I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole
I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole

When you search the rain for the silver cloud 
And you wait on days of gold
When you pitch to the bottom 
And the dirt comes down 
You cry so cold, so cold

I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole
I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole

Now there's something good in a worried song 
For the trouble in your soul
'Cause a worried man who's been a long way down
Down in a deep dark hole

I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole
I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole, 
Down in a deep, dark hole

I'm down in a deep, dark hole

// Honey Now //

I can't be called
Begged or bought
If you want to be my
Johnny on the spot

[Chorus:]
Honey now now now
Honey now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now

Front door's shut
Back door too
Blind's pulled down
What you gonna do

[Chorus]

You take your time
And get me sore
Tell me what you want
To keep waiting for

[Chorus]

Now now now
Now now now
Now now now
Now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now

// I'm Not Afraid To Die //

Nobody knows what waits ahead
Beyond the earth and sky
Lie-d Lie-d Lie
I'm not afraid to die

And there the work of my own hand
Be broken by and by
Lie-d Lie-d Lie
I'm not afraid to die

Sometimes it finds me fast asleep
And wakes me where I lie
Lie-d Lie-d Lie
I'm not afraid to die

Forget my sins upon the wind
My hobo soul will rise
Lie-d Lie-d Lie
I'm not afraid to die

Lie-d Lie-d Lie
I'm not afraid to die

// Rock Of Ages //

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages

Oh, my mother who's gone
she told me I should meet her
Someday streets of gold
Gonna guide me on to greet her

Once my father sat down
and told me of the prophets
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
they're gone but not forgotten

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
til my body gives out 
gonna read the gospel pages

Moses heard a voice
it called him up the mountain
forty days had set
when Moses come a shoutin'

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
til my body gives out 
gonna read the gospel pages

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages

// Whiskey Girl //

Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld

I'd take you down
Honey if I could
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
We'd find a place
In the sunshine
We'd be feeling good

Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
Don't you know
That it ain't a crime
If all the squares
And the junkmen
Think you're out of line

Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man and
The whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld

// Winter's Come And Gone //

Oh little red bird
Come to my window sill
Been so lonesome
Shaking that morning chill
Oh little red bird
Open your mouth and say
Been so lonesome
Just about flown away

So long now I've been out
In the rain and snow
But winter's come and gone
A little bird told me so

Oh little blue bird
Pearly feather breast
Five cold nickels all I got left
Oh little blue bird
What am I gonna do
Five cold nickels
Ain't gonna see me through

So long now I've been out
In the rain and snow
But winter's come and gone
A little bird told me so

Oh little black bird
On my wire line
Dark as trouble
In this heart of mine
Poor little black bird
Sings a worried song
Dark as trouble 
'Til winter's come and gone 

So long now I've been out
In the rain and snow
But winter's come and gone
A little bird told me so

So long now I've been out
In the rain and snow
But winter's come and gone
A little bird told me so
