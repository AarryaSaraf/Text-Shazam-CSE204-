// Orphan Girl //

I am an orphan on God's highway
But I'll share my troubles if you go my way

I have no mother, no father
No sister, no brother
I am an orphan girl

I have had friendships pure and golden
The ties of kinship have not known them

I know no mother, no father
No sister, no brother
I am an orphan girl

But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God's table

I'll meet my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
No more an orphan girl

Blessed Savior make me willing
Walk beside me until I'm with them

Be my mother, my father
My sister, my brother
I am an orphan girl
I am an orphan girl

// Annabelle //

Lease twenty acres and one Ginny mule
From the Alabama Trust
Half of the cotton, third of the corn
Get a handful of dust

We cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
'Til we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

I had a daughter called her Annabelle
She's the apple of my eye
Tried to give her something like I never had
Didn't want to ever hear her cry

We cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
'Til we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

When I'm dead and buried, I'll take a hard life of tears
Everyday I've ever known
Anna's in the churchyard, she's got no life at all
She's only got these words on a stone

We cannot have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

// Pass You By //

I got an old V-8 from the year I was born
Don't look like much just a flat black Ford
But the engine's clean, I could paint it someday
But most of the time I like it this way

Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road gonna pass you by

Well, I used to talk tough, I used to get loud
Want to paint my name all over this town
The folks lined up just to dog my day
Now if I stay quiet they stay out of my way

Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road gonna pass you by

I got a brand new plan, I'm gonna help myself
'Cause it's a fat man's town, I'm gonna share the wealth
Put the money in the bag, keep your hands in sight
Turn around count to ten and I go back into the night

Don't turn no head, don't catch no eye
Just a wind on the road gonna pass you by

Don't come over here, don't scream don't cry
Just a wind on the road gonna pass you by

I got an old V-8 from the year I was born
Don't look like much just a flat black Ford

// Barroom Girls //

Oh, the night came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
The smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls
And they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls

Well, she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind
And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
Leave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls

Ah, the barroom girls go by your side
Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
And all of the colors go around in a swirl
When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls

Now she rolls to her feet when she can't sleep no more
Looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

// One More Dollar //

A long time ago left my home
For job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me

So I sent my wages to my home
Said, we'd soon be 'gether
For the next good crop, pay my way
And I'd come home forever

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home

No work, said the boss at bunkhouse door
There's freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at bar downtown
I rolled and took my chances

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home

A long time ago left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
My luck has turned against me

One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
Just one more dollar and I'm going home

One more dollar, boys, I'm going home

// By The Mark //

When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my Savior
By the mark where the nails have been

By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon His precious skin
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been

A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the King of Heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools

By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon His precious skin
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been

On Calvary's Mountain
Where they made Him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago

By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon His precious skin
I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been

I will know my Savior when I come to Him
By the mark where the nails have been

// Paper Wings //

Paper wings, all torn and bent
You made me feel like
They were heaven sent

Paper wings, not real at all
They took me high
Enough to really fall

Your paper kisses faded too soon
Just like a paper rose
'Neath a paper moon

Paper wings, paper wings
Oh, how could I expect
To fly with only paper wings?

Angels were singing, didn't you hear?
If only I'd listened close
When they whispered in my ear

Paper wings, paper wings
Oh, how could I expect
To fly with only paper wings?
I tried to fly but found
That I had only paper wings

// Tear My Stillhouse Down //

Put no stone at my head, no flowers on my tomb
No gold plated sign in a marble pillared room
The one thing I want when they lay me in the ground
When I die, tear my stillhouse down

Oh, tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace of the hiding place
Where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money, no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me

When I was a child way back in the hills
I laughed at the men who tended those stills
But that old mountain shine, it caught me somehow
When I die, tear my stillhouse down

Oh, tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace of the hiding place
Where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money, no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me

Oh, tell all your children that Hell ain't no dream
'Cause Satan lives in my whiskey machine
And in my time of dying I know where I'm bound
When I die, tear my stillhouse down

Oh, tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don't leave no trace of the hiding place
Where I made that evil stuff
For all my time and money, no profit did I see
That old copper kettle was the death of me

That old copper kettle was the death of me

// Acony Bell //

The fairest bloom the mountain knows
Is not an iris or a wild rose
But the little flower of which I'll tell
Known as the brave acony bell

Just a simple flower so small and plain
With a pearly hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds sing when they see it bloom
For they know that spring is coming soon

Well it makes its home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies deep on the windy hills
And it tells the world "why should i wait
This ice and snow is gonna melt away"

And so I'll sing that yellow bird's song
For the troubled times will soon be gone

// Only One And Only //

There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky

Twice as many tear drops
There to wash it down
Everyone's another lullaby

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a world of trouble
Trying to take it's turn
I can hear it shaking the underground

Half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize

Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
You're the only one and only
Why'd you go and leave me lonely?
