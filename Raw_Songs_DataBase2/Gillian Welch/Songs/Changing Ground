I have stood on the changing ground
I have walked like a man in chains
I tried hard to do my best
But I could not make my way

Oh, trouble was on my tail
And he dogged me like a hound
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

There was a rumbling out of my feet
There was a howling in the air
And when the tempest broke
I made a mighty prayer

But no one was at my side
And no hiding place I found
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

And when I took his hand, I was real arranged
I cried out, "My God, I'm changed!"
Tell me Lord, what can I do?
He said, "Tell your sister and your brother, too"
And I testified His truth:

I have stood on the changing ground
I have walked like a man in chains
I tried hard to do my best
But I could not make my way

Oh, trouble was on my tail
And he dogged me like a hound
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

Changing ground
