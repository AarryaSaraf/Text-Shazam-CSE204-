Two whole years of a millworker's life
All worn out by noon
Johnny dear, don't take a wife
I'll be coming home soon

First hard snow killed the old sow
Farm and family's all fine
Jenny-o, no time now
But I'll write more next time

More hard times than I can endure
From a letter so cold and strange
Johnny mine, I'm not sure
I'm so scared you've changed

Stars above, know it's true
We can never be one
Johnny love, I'd die for you
Though our time is done
