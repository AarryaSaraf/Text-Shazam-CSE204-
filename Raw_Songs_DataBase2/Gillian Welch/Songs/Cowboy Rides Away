Last call was an hour ago
Some drinking up and going home
I'm counting you a no-show
So what can I say?

I ought to be leaving town
Start walking with my head turned down
I can't afford to hang around
For one more day

I'm waiting on a used-to-be
I should be flying free
Saint Chris is awaiting me
The rideaway

I ought to be leaving town
Start walking with my head turned down
I can't afford to hang around
For one more day

I don't even want to stay
And everybody knows that the cowboy rides away
