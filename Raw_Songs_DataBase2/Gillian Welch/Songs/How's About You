Mud on my shoes, shoes on my feet
I've been walking up and down the street
Buddy, I've seen a thing or two
How's about you?

Ain't got a nickel, I'm broken down flat
Wish I had one of those porkpie hats
'Cause this old rain's about soaked through
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday

Man in the church, man on the hill
Says he won't hurt me, but I know he will
I've been worrying the whole night through
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday

Criminal man, ain't behind bars
He's a-driving one of them Cadillac cars
I'm gonna switch sides real soon
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday
