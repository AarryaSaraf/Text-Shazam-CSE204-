I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer

Then watched the sky
Then wanted to cry
So only you and I
And how I try

I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer

Help me rise above
What I'm thinking of
Just a little more love
Just a little more love

I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
