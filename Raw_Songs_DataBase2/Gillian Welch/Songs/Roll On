People a'talking
Said 'everybody knows'
Why am I the last to hear
That you're a no-good so-and-so?

Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone

This tear I'm crying
Ain't account of you
Just a natural lover feeling
That's the Kansas City blues

So Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone
Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone

Now this old muddy river
Rolls to New Orleans
Gonna find a good man there
And several in between

So roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone
Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone
