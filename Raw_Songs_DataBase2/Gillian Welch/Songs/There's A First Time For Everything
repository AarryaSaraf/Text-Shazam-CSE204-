There's a first time for everything

Take the first time we met and said our brave hellos
I will never forget you were looking at your toes
When I finally caught your eye it was like a sudden spring
There's a first time for everything

Take the first time we kissed on that night full of love
Too perfect to resist, it was heaven above
And I thought we were there 'cause I heard angels sing
There's a first time for everything

There's a first time, it happens just a moment and yet
There's a feeling inside that you never forget

Take the first time you laughed and said you were true
That you never had tried the things cheaters do
And it's too bad I had to hear her whispering
There's a first time for everything

There's a first time, it happens just a moment and yet
There's a feeling inside that you never forget

Take the first time you cried when I gave back your ring
There's a first time for everything
There's a first time for everything
