I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
Now I feel like a natural man

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

200 dollars and a pair of mohair slacks
200 dollars and a pair of mohair slacks
200 dollars and a pair of slacks
That's all I'm taking when I get the tracks

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

So don't call my number, 'cause I hate to hear it ring
Don't call my number, 'cause I hate to hear it ring
Don't call my number, 'cause I hate the ring
I know it's trouble if it's anything

Been good 'till now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down
You're gonna miss me, darling
When I'm not around

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city
Sin City
