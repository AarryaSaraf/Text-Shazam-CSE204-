I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I want to reach that Glory Land
I want to shake my Savior's hand

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll

I been a-traveling near and far
But I want to lay down my old guitar

And I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to 'lectrify my soul
'Cause everybody been making a shout
So big and loud, been drownin' me out
I want to sing that rock and roll
I want to sing that rock and roll
