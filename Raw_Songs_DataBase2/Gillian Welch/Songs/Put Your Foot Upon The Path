You've been living fancy fine
You've been doing as you please
This life of your design
Will bring you to your knees

'Cause there is no road so rough
Even angels feel the tread
But when you lose enough
No more circus and no more bread

Put your foot upon the path
Put your hands upon a plow
Never be afraid to laugh
Just be glad that you know how
You can turn your head away
You can drive against the wind
You may leave another day
You may never laugh again

You could read your heart
Like a book upon the shelf
Would you wrestle with the part
Be afraid to be yourself

'Cause the lines are very thin
Your bluff is already called
It's a long, hard road of sin
And that first step feels like a fall

Put your foot upon the path
Put your hands upon a plow
Never be afraid to laugh
Just be glad that you know how
You can turn your head away
You can drive against the wind
You may leave another day
You may never laugh again

You may never laugh again
