Take me back to Ramona Street
And fill my glass again with a bittersweet
'Cause I don't wanna see the life I had
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

The same mistake that I made before
But I'll be wakin' up on a killing floor
While the bells are ringin' so low and sad
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

The same mistake that I made before
But I'll be wakin' up on a killing floor
I remember now how I made you mad
I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad

I thought the next time 'round wouldn't be so bad
Wouldn't be so bad
