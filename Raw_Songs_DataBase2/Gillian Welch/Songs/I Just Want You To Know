Don't you know, when you're sad
And all your sweet dreams are bad
A little sunshine, and your garden will grow
I just want you to know

When you're down, what you need
Is a good friend, and call on me
'Cause I could find you wherever you go
I just want you to know

Sometimes I don't talk about it
But you're wrong to ever doubt it
'Cause my love is so strong
And I've been here for so long

You don't know how I feel
And that my love for you is real
When you cry, you don't cry alone
I just want you to know

I just want you to know
I just want you to know
