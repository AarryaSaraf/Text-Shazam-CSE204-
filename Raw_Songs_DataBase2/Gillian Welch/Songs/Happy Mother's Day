Oh, it's happy Mother's Day
From your daughter far away
Loving wishes, hugs and kisses
Happy happy Mother's Day

I am thinking of you now
And I'll try to tell you how
Much I love you and I miss you
On this happy Mother's Day

Oh mom, I hope you know
That I always love you so
Not just the one day when we all say
Happy happy Mother's Day

Oh, it's happy Mother's Day
From your daughter far away
Hugs and kisses, loving wishes
Happy happy Mother's Day
Oh, it's happy Mother's Day
