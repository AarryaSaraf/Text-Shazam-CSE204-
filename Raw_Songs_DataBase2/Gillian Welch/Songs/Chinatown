Sundown and the bells are warning
Did I miss the mailman again?
No, he had nothing for me
And nobody called today
And no one knows what to say
Black sun is beating down
On Chinatown

All of the sweetest flowers
They grow up on the sunny side
But down here, it's the darkest hour
And we run the other way
Midnight to yesterday
And we're always upside down
In Chinatown

Oh, though I tried to manage
You don't understand my mind
Our love used to speak in Spanish
There's a poison in the air
The fever's everywhere
Bad haze that hangs around
In Chinatown

Bad haze that hangs around
In Chinatown
