I am the rake and the rambling blade
Bound to dance in the hangman's shade
Wear my scars, white as lace
Save me a prayer and a resting place

Oh, I am the rake and the rambling blade
You'll never know the miles I made
All my time spent on the run
But I have no debts and I promise none

I've never been a workin' man
I never took money from a needy hand
I won't take nothin' for my journey now
Though I see a sign a-hangin' 'bout
Oh, I see the sign a-hangin' 'bout

I am the rake and the rambling blade
Bound to dance in the hangman's shade
Wear my scars, white as lace
Save me a prayer and a resting place
For I am the rake and the rambling blade
