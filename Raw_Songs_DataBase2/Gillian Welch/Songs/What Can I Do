A strange embrace
That stays in time
A poison halo
Pervades your mind
I feel it too
But what can I do?

You lost your sparkle
And your cigarettes
You found an angel
Who'll take your bets
She called back for you
But what can I do?

What can I do for you, darling?
I'd love to know
'Cause I love you so

It wouldn't matter
I you hit the heights
The cash in millions
Or your name in lights
You'd still be blue
But what can I do?

What can I do?
