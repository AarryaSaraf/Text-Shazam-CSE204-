Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
And my dad was passin' through doing things a man will do
And my mother was just a girl, seventeen

It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
And I have a life to claim though I really don't know my name
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all

Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But it's written up in the sky and I'll see it by and by
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name

Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
And they took me to their breast and they surely stood the test
Yes, I had a good mother and dad just the same

Now there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Just another baby born to a girl lost and lorn
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name

Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
And on the crowded street I see a strangers face that looks like me
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind

'Cause there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But I'll see it by and by 'cause it's written up in the sky
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
