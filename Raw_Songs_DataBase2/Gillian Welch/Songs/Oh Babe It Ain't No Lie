One old woman, Lord, in this town
Keep telling those lies on me
I wish to my soul that old woman would die
Keep telling those lies on me

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high

I've been all around this whole wide world
That I just got back today
Work like a dog, honey, all week through
Honey babe, what more can I say?

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high
