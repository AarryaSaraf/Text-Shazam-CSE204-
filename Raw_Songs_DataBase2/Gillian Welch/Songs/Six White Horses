Six white horses coming two by two
Six white horses coming two by two
Coming for my mother, no matter how I love her
Six white horses coming two by two

Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
So broken hearted, up now they started
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels

See them horses pulling on a rein
See them horses pulling on a rein
Sunshine and sorrow, yesterday, tomorrow
Bedlam and Barlow Billy are their names

Some bright morning what will you see
Some bright morning what will you see
Some bright morning looking on it coming
Some bright morning what will you see

There's six white horses coming after me
Six white horses coming after me
Pretty as a picture, certain as a scripture
Six white horses coming after me
