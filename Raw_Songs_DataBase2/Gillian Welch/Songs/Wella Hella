Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

Now, I've been sittin' just right here
And you've been sittin' over there all night
And it's getting late
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Why must you hesitate?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

I can shimmy and shing-a-ling
Bunny hop and shake a thing alright
If you take a chance
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Don't you wanna dance?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello

Now tell me, honey, is it Mary Anne
Mary Ellen, Peggy Sue, or Jean
Or Etta Loreen?
What am I gonna call you
When you're in my dreams?

Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey, hello
Tell me nice and slow, ain't you got a name?
'Cause I gotta know
Wella-wella, hella-hello, honey
Wella-hella, hello
