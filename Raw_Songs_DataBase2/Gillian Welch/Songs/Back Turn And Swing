Well the fiddler's up and bow is flyin'
Momma's in the kitchen and the bacon is fryin'
Boys can't dance, by God they're tryin'
Every time they hear that call, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

All the girls jump up and the win is pourin'
Dust comin' up 'tween the cracks in the floor, an'
The old folks they don't dance anymore
Unless you play somethin' slow, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

Well this corn come from Joe McMillan
It's better than all last year, my heavens
Not so sweet, it's fifty seven
That was a summer old, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

Well the fiddler's up and bow is flyin'
Momma's in the kitchen and the bacon is fryin'
Boys can't dance, by God they're tryin'
Every time they hear that call back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
