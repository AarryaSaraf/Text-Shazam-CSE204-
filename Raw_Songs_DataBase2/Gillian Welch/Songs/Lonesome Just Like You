Go on and leave me anytime you please
You can leave me weeping in the willow trees
But little darling, you know it's true
I'll be lonesome just like you

Go on and find you another love
I'm gonna get me a turtle dove
And when they both have fallen through
I'll be lonesome just like you

In the whole world over, in the whole world 'round
There's no two people so closely bound
But when the darkness is sad and blue
I'll be lonesome just like you

Go on and leave me anytime you please
You can leave me weeping to the willow trees
Until you come back, until you're true
I'll be lonesome just like you
I'll be lonesome just like you
