There's a mighty good book and it tells a story
It's a bible on a shelf
Oh you know the names and you know the stories
Have you ever read it for yourself?

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

Oh it tells of the hill in land of Zion
Where they took a man who made no crime
While the wicked watched and the women were cryin'
And the sun refused to shine

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

Now there's gonna come a day when you go to glory
And you're gonna hear the master's call
Are you gonna wish you read the story
Of when Jesus paid it all?

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today
