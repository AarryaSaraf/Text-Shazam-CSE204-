I've been riding high
But I don't know why
Everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

It's a sunny day
And I'm on my way
But everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

People stand in a line
Just to hear me cry
And I wanna know
The other side

Everyone I choose
Only brings bad news
Cause everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

People stand in a line
Just to hear me cry
I wanna know
The other side

It's a sunny day
And I'm on my way
But everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears
Well everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears
Well everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears
