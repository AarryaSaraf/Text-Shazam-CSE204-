What can I do?
What can I do?
I have to prove myself to you

You treat me like a child
Just like a child
You want to feed me 'til I smile

Friends wanna know
They wanna know
Why they don't see me anymore

Here come the news
Here come the news
I've got the big old highway blues

I'm out in the rain
I'm in the rain
Oh, with a need I can't explain

Words that I've said
The words I've said
You'll use against me in the end
