Strange Isabella
Never had a coat to wear
Strange Isabella
Leaves her perfume in the air

Says, "What do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
What do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from"

Strange Isabella
Never learned to tie her shoes
Strange Isabella
She never had the walkin' blues

Says, "What do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
What do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from"

Strange Isabella
Never had to wash her hands
Strange Isabella
Have pity on the workin' man

And what do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
And what do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from

Strange Isabella
