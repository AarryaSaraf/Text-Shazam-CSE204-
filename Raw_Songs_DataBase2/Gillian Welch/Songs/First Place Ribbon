Kathy never would wear britches
Kathy never would wear shoes
She's the kinda girl, likes some dust between her toes
Since she never gets the blues

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair

Oh, Kathy never did like preachers
Didn't like to tell the truth
Caught my eye, no she was not shy
I was a'walking by the kissing booth

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair

(What'd you get that ribbon for, Kathy?)

Oh Kathy never would be bridled
Wouldn't ever settle down
Broke my heart, and I bawl and cry
Every time the fair's in town

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair
