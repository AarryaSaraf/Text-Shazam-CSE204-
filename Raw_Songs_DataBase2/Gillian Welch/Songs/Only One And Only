There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky

Twice as many tear drops
There to wash it down
Everyone's another lullaby

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a world of trouble
Trying to take it's turn
I can hear it shaking the underground

Half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize

Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
You're the only one and only
Why'd you go and leave me lonely?
