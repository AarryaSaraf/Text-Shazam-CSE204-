Let me tell you, buddy
There's a faster gun
Coming over yonder
When tomorrow comes

Let me tell you, buddy
And it won't be long
Till you find yourself singing
Your last cowboy song

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings

When they wrap my body
In the thin linen sheet
And they take my six irons
Pull the boots from my feet

Unsaddle my pony
She'll be itching to roam
I'll be halfway to heaven
Under horsepower of my own

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
I'm glory-bound
No more jingle jangle
I lay my guns down

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings
