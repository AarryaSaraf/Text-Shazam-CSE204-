It was on a fair September night
That my lover came to me
I said, "Darling girl, you're strange to me now
Not like you used to be"
I remember you as a beautiful rose
Out in the morning light
But now your cheeks so silent and pale
And you only walk at night

Oh yes, the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom

Then she left me there as I Iay in a thirst
That water could not quell
And her voice was sad and soft in her throat
As she bid me last farewell

And now the sun is hateful and sore
On the racing streets at noon
And so I wait alone through the day
And like the jasmine bloom
