Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages

Oh, my mother who's gone
she told me I should meet her
Someday streets of gold
Gonna guide me on to greet her

Once my father sat down
and told me of the prophets
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
they're gone but not forgotten

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
til my body gives out 
gonna read the gospel pages

Moses heard a voice
it called him up the mountain
forty days had set
when Moses come a shoutin'

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
til my body gives out 
gonna read the gospel pages

Round, round, I wanna go round
wanna see the rock of ages
when my body gives out 
gonna read the final pages
