Hello, stranger, lover, friend
Hello, angel on the mend
There's a side of you
That I never knew
As you shed another skin
We're strangers again

Hello, trouble in my arms
There was another one with your charms
And he had your name
You are not the same
Boy, I knew back then
We're strangers again

Hello, rain man in the mirror
Now I see you've noticed all these tears
We can start anew
If you're willing
To smile and pretend
We're strangers again

If we met before
I am very sure
That I would remember when
We're strangers again
