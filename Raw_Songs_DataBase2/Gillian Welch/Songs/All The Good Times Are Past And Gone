I wish to the Lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I'd never have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more

Come back, come back, my own true love
And stay awhile with me
If ever I had a friend in this world
You've been a friend to me

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more

Now don't you see that  train
Coming around the bend
It'll take me away from this dirty old town
Never to return again

Now don't you see that lonesome dove
It flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his only true love
Just like I mourn for mine

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more
