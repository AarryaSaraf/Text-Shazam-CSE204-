If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go
Hold me out in the cold rain and snow
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go

Gonna drink corn liquor 'til my blood runs clear
Gonna drink corn liquor 'til my blood runs clear
Call me drunk and so and so
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go

If you ain't got religion, you are dead always
If you ain't got religion, you're dead always
I believe what the bible says
If you ain't got religion, you're dead always

Been walking this morning and my feet are tired
Been walking this morning, my feet are tired
Miles and miles on a desert low
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go
