Oh, beautiful boy
What did I do to win your love?
I didn't mean to make you cry
What'll I do when morning comes?

You, you tremble and shake
Like an autumn leaf expecting to fall
Almost think you saw my mind
But you don't know me at all

'Cause I'm afraid of everything
Everything that romance brings
Freely givin' gifts that you can't repay
Sad goodbyes and darkened hearts
Telephones, and most of all
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday

You, you ain't to blame
Crazy love's got a mind of its own
You can't fight it once it stops
You can't help it if it don't

So I'm afraid of everything
Everything that romance brings
Freely givin' gifts that you can't repay
Sad goodbyes and darkened hearts
Telephones, and most of all
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday
I'm scared I'm gonna break your heart someday
