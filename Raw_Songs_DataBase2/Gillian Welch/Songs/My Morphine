I looked around and all up and down
I never wasted time on two or three
There's only one girl for me

There was a time she used to treat me fine
But lately she's been acting awful stoned
Makes a man weep alone

eye dee oh lay ee tee
eye dee leeldle odle ay oo ee tee
eye dee oh lee tee
lee tee
deedle ohdle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

You should have seen me and my Morphine
When we used to go dancing in the war
Spin me right off the floor

eye dee oh lay ee tee
eye dee leeldle odle ee odle ee tee
eye dee odle ee tee
lee tee
deedle odle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

Morphine, Morphine, what made you so mean?
You never used to do me like you do
Where's that sweet gal i knew?

eye dee oh lee tee
eye dee leedle odle ay odle ay tee
eye dee oh lay tee

deedle odle lee tee
My Morphine be the death of me

My Morphine
