Got a dusty neck and a bent back low
Feel the heat rise up off the red dog road
And up ahead's just more of the road not showin'
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

It's a long way up and a long way back
Ain't no shortcut and no sidetrack
And it ain't one sign of a shade tree growing
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

That's a hundred miles to get back to you
Been a hundred years, maybe two

I see the road stretch out for the old home place
I see a glad tear standing on grandma's face
Gonna get some love and a big hello in
That's a hundred miles that I'm going

Got a dusty neck and a bent back low
Feel the heat rise up off the red dog road
And up ahead's just more of the road not showing
That's a hundred miles that I'm going
