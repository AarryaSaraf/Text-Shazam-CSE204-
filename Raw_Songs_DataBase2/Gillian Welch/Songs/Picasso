There's a man at my doorway, brown as a railroad bum
There's a man at my doorway, brown as a railroad bum
Says his name is Picasso, I said, "Where did you come from?"

He painted a picture, made me green and blue
He painted a picture, made me green and blue
But the more I looked at it, the more I wanted to

I said, "Go away, Picasso, go on and let me be"
Go away, Picasso, go on and let me be
Since I seen your picture, everything looks wrong to me

All the pretty ponies are riding in the sun
All the pretty ponies are riding in the sun
I'm gonna go get a hotel, try to get my laundry done
