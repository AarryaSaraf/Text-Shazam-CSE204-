There's too much wrist at the end of his coat
Too much bitter at the back of his throat
Too much winter coming after the fall
To be walking the streets of St. Paul
To be walking the streets of St. Paul

There's too much makeup for the time of day
Too much of high heel and way too much leg
Too much of 14 underneath it all
To be walking the streets of St. Paul
To be walking the streets of St. Paul

Oh, see the little sparrow
Who's watching? Who's watching?
I see the little sparrow

Too much troubles for me to shake
All this weather and blinding ache
Makes my body feel sad and small
Walking the streets of St. Paul
Walking the streets of St. Paul
