Our love was sweetest in the spring
And when you gave a wedding ring
I gave to you this golden vow

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now

Before they caught us in a lie
We crossed our hearts, prepared to die
We crossed our hearts, prepared to die

Down where the cold waters flow
Down where the brushes overgrow
That's where my baby's sleeping, oh

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now

We went to jail without a shout
The night they came to find us out
The night they came to find us out

But all your money set you free
And saved you from the gallows tree
And saved you from the hanging bough

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now
