I can't be called
Begged or bought
If you want to be my
Johnny on the spot


Honey now now now
Honey now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now

Front door's shut
Back door too
Blind's pulled down
What you gonna do



You take your time
And get me sore
Tell me what you want
To keep waiting for



Now now now
Now now now
Now now now
Now now now
You know later won't
Do me no good anyhow
Honey now now now
