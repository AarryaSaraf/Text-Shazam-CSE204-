I don't see a sign of sleep
I can't even rhyme tonight
Something here that runs too deep
But I tell you I'm alright

It's fear that holds my tongue
Fear that holds my hand
The race that I must run
'Til I can't stand

I haven't left a lie untold
Still I watch and wait
I will pray and I will hope
That I learn before too late

I will search my barren soul
To see what I can find
Look at me, the last to know
That I have been blind on the inside
