Rolling out of Raleigh, been trying to make a living
Listening to the station with a rockabilly rhythm
Down about Atlanta and I started slowing
Might need a little bit of something just to keep a-going

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Birmingham never been a long time coming
All the way to Jackson, got the radio a-humming
Trying to make Dallas, but my head kept chugging
Wish I had a little 'cause I gotta keep the motor working

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Last four miles, got my hand on the buckle
Gonna get some loving from a certain honeysuckle
He's my sugar and he's been there waiting
It's been a long time Betty, don't be hesitating

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
