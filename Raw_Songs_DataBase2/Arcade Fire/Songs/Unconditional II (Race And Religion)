At the crossroad
There's a street sign
It's a construct
How'd it get in my mind?
It's a door to the divine
It's a fine line in the end times

I'll be yours
You can be mine
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides
Into the color of your eyes

I'll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no superstition
United body and soul

Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

It's joy and it's union
Your sense of rhythm
How you take communion
It's a door to the divine
It's the moonlight on a landmine

I'll be yours (I'll be yours)
You can be mine (You be mine)
Love unites
Breaking as the light divides
Into the color of your eyes

I'll be your race and religion
You be my race and religion
This love is no competition
United body and soul

Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

The light arrives from the past
Hits your eyes before it divides
Into colors
YOU and ME could be WE
Could be
WE

Are the light you can't see
And WE are the roots of the tree
And WE've got one life
No time for division
New vision
Be my race and religion

Race and religion (Race and religion)
Race and religion
Race and religion (Race and religion)

I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul (Body and soul)
I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul (Body and soul)
I'll be your
Race and religion
You could be my
Body and soul
