I heard the thunder on a blue sky perfect day, I wonder why
Am I the only one?
I heard the thunder and I feel I'm going under, Jesus Christ
Was an only son

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?

I heard the thunder and I thought it was the answer, but I find
I got the question wrong
I was trying to run away but a voice told me to stay
And put the feeling in a song

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

A day, a week, a month, a year
A day, a week, a month, a year
Every second brings me here

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?

Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the lightning
Waiting on the light
What will the light bring?
