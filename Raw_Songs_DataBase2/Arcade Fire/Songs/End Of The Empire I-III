One last dance
Here at the end of the empire
Makes me cry
Watchin' the moon on the ocean
Where California used to be

It's not half bad, uh-oh
Spend half your life bein' sad, whoa
Don't be scared, uh-oh
Just chronically impaired, uh-oh
Just take my hand, uh-oh
Standin' at the end of
The American Empire

One last song
Here at the end of the movie
They seemed so sure
At least, that's the way I remember
The war
What New York used to be

It's not half bad, no
Spend half your life being sad, whoa
Don't you weep, uh-oh
Half your life, fast asleep, uh-oh
Feelin' uninspired, uh-oh
Standin' at the end of
The American Empire

And we know that it's time to go
Heard the news on the radio
One last round before we go
Through the pale, atmospheric glow

And the oxygen's getting low
Sing a song that we used to know
One last round before we go
One last round before we go

So sad

Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink, and I
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losin' you
Didn't use to get low
This time of night, and I
Didn't use to walk home
In the mornin' light without you
Without you

Didn't use to get high
Didn't use to drink
Didn't use to think I
Could ever dream about losin' you
You, but I do

It's you and I
It's do or die
Suicide mission
Baby, by my side
We got one life and half of it's gone
You know, I can't sleep with the television on
Didn't use to get high
With you by my side
Leave the light on
