When it comes to loaning out my love...
Ooh! You can call me stingy
You can call me selfish
Call me possessive too
Call me a miser, I'm gonna be tight
When it comes to sharing you, baby

I can loan you a cup of sugar
I'll loan you my coat, a tire or my car
And borrow some bread, yes I  for your head
And your  to get you out of the dark, hey

When it comes to loaning out my love, ah...
You can call me stingy, call me cheap
But I won't lend to you, no no no, no no no
Call me bad names, I'll be a creep
But I can't lend love to you, baby, baby, baby

You can pawn my rings and things
I'll even loan you a song to sing
(This is where we draw the line)
This is where we draw the line
Will it cross your mind, forget 
You can have my love on time

When it comes to loaning out my love...
I'm a hog for you baby, I get down
When it comes to your love
I'm a hog, you're a hog
I'm a big fat - oink oink - for you baby
I'm a hog for you baby (you see I'm a hog)
I get down when it comes to your love
I'm stingy, stingy, woman you see...

You can pawn my rings and things
I'll even give you a song to sing
This is where we draw the line
Will it cross your mind, forget 

When it comes to loaning out my love...
You see, the last time I've known her
Keep body on her 
I would never fall in love again
He used her like a tube
Made me feel like a fool, baby
Puttin' me  when was through, oh no!

I can loan you a cup of sugar
Loan you my coat, or a tire from my car
Loan you some bread, I hap for your head
And your  to get you out of the dark, hey

When it comes to loaning out my love...
I'm not gonna share you, baby
I'm a hog for you baby, I get down
When it comes to your love
I'm a hog, you're a hog
I'm a big fat - oink oink - for you baby
I'm a hog for you baby
(I'm a hog-wild, I'm jealous, now)
I get down when it comes to your love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, mama you see...

You can pawn my rings and things
I'll even loan you a song to sing
(This is where we draw the line)
This is where we draw the line, yeah
Will it cross your mind, forget 
You can have my love on time

When it comes to loaning out my love...
I would loan you a cup of sugar, yeah
But you're too sweet to loan, you see
You can call me stingy, call me selfish
Call me possessive too
Call me a miser, I'm gonna be tight
When it comes to sharing you, baby
(Comes to sharing you)

You can pawn my rings and things
I'll even lend you a song to sing
Here's where we draw the line...
Will it cross your mind, forget 
You can have my love on time

When it comes to loaning out my love...
I'm a hog for you baby, I get down
When it comes to your love (your love)
I'm a hog for you baby, I get down
When it comes to your love (your love)

You can buy my rings and things
I'll even give you a song to sing
This is where we draw the line
You can buy my rings and things
I'll even give you a song to sing

When it comes to loaning out my love...
When it comes (when it comes to)
To loaning out my love...
You can have my love on time
When it comes (when it comes to)

When it comes (you can have all my money)
To loaning out my love... (but when it comes to)
When it comes (to, when it comes to)
To loaning out my love... (baby baby, baby baby)
When it comes (hey darling)
