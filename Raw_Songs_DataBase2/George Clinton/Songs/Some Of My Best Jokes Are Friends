The world is equal proportions
Of bullseyes and bullshit
They were bullish and they were foolish
Now there's no one to listen when they talk

Adam split the scene on the Eve of destruction
Not unlike the way we split our jeans
But like the way we split our pair of genes
We split the whole world at the seams
Someone call the Space Limousine
Alright

Hitler hit the scene with dreams of destruction
Not knowing what atom splitting means
While he dreamed his mean dreams
The means to his dreams split the scene
Someone call the Space Limousine
Alright

Basic training in the ghetto
Basic training in the ghetto
They talked about your mama and you took it
Where does the logic lie therein?
Some of my best jokes are friends

Basic training in the ghetto

They talked about your mama and you took it
Where does the logic lie therein?
Some of my best jokes are friends

But like the way we split our genes
We split the whole world, so it seems

Yes
Space Limousine here
I read you loud and clear
Give me coordinates
You see there isn't a second to waste
There's no second, there's no second to waste

All aboard right on time
Before the Mothership
3-2-1-00 countdown
Will climb, will climb

Atom split the scene on the Eve of destruction
Nothing like the way we split a pair of jeans
But like the way we split our genes
We split the whole world at the seams
Someone call the Space Limousine
As a matter of critical mass
Nukes, are not a laughing matter

Basic training in the ghetto

They talked about your mama and you took it
Where does the logic lie therein?
Some of my best jokes are friends

Space Limousine here
Bad news about the fuel
We're burning up
We're low on juice
I've said low on juice
So where does the logic lie therein
Some of my best jokes are friends
