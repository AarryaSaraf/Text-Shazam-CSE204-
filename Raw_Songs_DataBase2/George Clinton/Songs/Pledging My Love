Forever my darling our love will be true
Always and forever, I'll love only you
Just promise me darling your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear forever burn

My heart's at your command, dear
To keep love and to hold
Making you happy is my desire
Keeping you is my goal

I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
And your loving ways

Yeah baby, pledging my love

My heart's at your command, dear

Keeping you is my goal

I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
