How many of y'all wanna get over the hump?

Come on, come on, come on
I see you tryin' to get loose
I said we should own the curve
Let's get that funky, funk

I said to try them on
And instead in the funk
Let's shoot them with the bop gun, baby
Say it

On guard, protect yourself

We got to get over the hump

Tryin' to get loose
Let me shoot them with the bop gun, baby

When the syndrome is around
Don't let your guard down
All you've got to do is
Come on and funk with me

On guard, defend yourself
Said I'm tryin' to get loose
And the prison gonna come
Let's get that funk on, baby

I said you turn 'em on again
It's burning the room
Unless you can bring them up again

On guard, defend yourself
I said I'm tryin' to let loose
On Saturday
On guard, protect yourself

To dance is a protection
Funk is your direction
All you got to do is
Funk and dance

On guard, defend yourself
Said I'm tryin' to let loose
On Saturday
On guard, protect yourself

I got to get over the hump
I got to get over the hump
Got to get over the hump
We gotta meet with y'all
I got to get over the hump

If y'all don't mind
They don't mind
I said, if you don't mind
They don't mind

Take your time tonight, yeah
Try to get over the hump, take your time
I see you been trapped on this tricky journey
I want y'all to sing
Come on, y'all
(Way to get over the hump)
You can do better than that
