Give me my kredit kard, baby
I thought I told you
No more charge accounts
Give me your kredit kard, baby
'Cause anything you get from now on
Is gonna have to be on your own bill

Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby
Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby

I can't let you have no more love on time
And your kredit rate is gone down, baby
You're gonna have to get
Somebody to co-sign
Oh yes, the interest rate has gone up, baby

Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby
Give me your kredit kard and I don't mean maybe
Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby

Put it on your own bill
Baby I will, love on time
Inflation rate is goin' up

And all in due time
You can put it on my kredit kard
And all in due time
You can put it on my kredit kard
All in good time
You can put it on my kredit kard

Let me in hock up to my neck
And if you find you want something else
And you will
You're gonna have to get you a job
So you can pay your own bill
'Cause if you don't
We both gonna be ill
But if we do it'll be a thrill
Give me my kredit kard, baby
You got me in hock up to my neck

Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby
Get your own kard now, baby
Get your own kredit kard now, baby
