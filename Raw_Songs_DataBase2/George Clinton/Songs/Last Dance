Last dance...

Oh, let your eyes have followed her to the dance floor
Your heart has been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance
Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflowers

Why don't you walk right up n' ask her for her hand
Maybe she'll funk with you
Oh, maybe she'll funk with you

So funky!

Last dance
Last dance

I dance alone and never gaze in her direction
Maybe she'll get funky with you
It does not mean that we did not trade affection
Last dance
By a little degree I always be that open
Last dance
Yes, you let your imagination sworn, hey
Last dance

Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower
Maybe she'll get funky with you...

Now them days and twisted bodies in your psyche
Oh, he's leavin' I'll pay sister
Last dance
You smartly hand you're not dreamin'
Last dance
Maybe she'll get funky with you, ah ah
Last dance

Oh, aren't you meant to be in joy heaven
It would have been, had you gotten with her
It's not so bad after all
It's not biorhythmic, psychoanalitic, profound
It leads a lot of weird dreams

Maybe she'll get funky with you
Sensitivity
Maybe she'll get funky with you...

May I have this dance
Ooh la la la la la la la la la...
The last dance...
Ooh la la la la la la la la la...
The last dance...

Maybe the last dance
You see it's 2 o'clock in the morning
You see, the last dance, hey baby

Last dance
Last dance

Oh, let your eyes have followed her to dance floor
Your heart has been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance

Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower...
