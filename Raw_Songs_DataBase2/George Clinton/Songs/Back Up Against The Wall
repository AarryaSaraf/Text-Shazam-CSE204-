Don't let them tell you I won't come or I'll be late
Don't listen when they say I pause or hesitate
Turn away when they hint or insinuate
Like a nosebleed I'll be runnin' red like
I'm exceedin' the speed limit
In a hurry to put my eyesight on you, girl

Put my back up against the wall
I might stumble but I won't fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but I won't fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Don't be surprised if you find out I'm on your trail
Don't be alarmed to find me hot on your tail
Don't cha turn me in don't turn me 'round
Don't turn your back 'cause like a choo choo
I'll be jumpin' train tracks avoiding trains on the same track
The only collision will be when I collide with you, girl

Put my back up against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but not fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but not fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Don't let them tell you I won't come or I'll be late
Don't listen when I pause or hesitate
Turn away when they hint or insinuate
Like a nosebleed I'll be runnin' red like
I'm exceedin' the speed limit
In a hurry to put my eyesight on you, girl

Got my back up against the wall
I might stumble but won't fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Like a nosebleed I'll be runnin' red like
I'm exceedin' the speed limit
In a hurry to put my eyesight on you, girl

(Said I got my back)
Got my back up against the wall
I might stumble but I won't fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
See, my back's against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall

Got my back against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall
Got my back against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall
Got my back against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall
Got my back against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall

Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
Tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tinga
