Time to groove down

Just when I can't face tonight
Feeling wide awake
I know that I should be sleepin'
But it don't seem too late
I sneak around behind at night
And much to my surprise
I ain't doin' no right, I'm keepin' time with
I know, I only, catches up with time
I'm ahead of time inside

I'm ahead of time inside
Ahead of time inside
Ahead of time inside

Get ready
Just when I can't face my watch
Gettin' a little bit late
Much too soon to get it started
But I can not wait

Shake, shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha
Shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha

I sleep around behind the high times bed
And much to my surprise
Money catches up with time
But I am ahead of time inside
It's time, it's time

Shake, shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha
Shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha

Move your body, yeah heh heh...

Just when I can't face my watch
Gettin' a little bit late
Much too soon to get it started
But I can not wait, no
I sleep behind, behind, behind the high times bed
Much to my surprise
Not only catches up the time
Ahead of time inside

Shake, shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha
Shake boy what's wrong with cha
You know what's gonna get cha

(Ahead of time inside)
Boogie right, boogie right...

Not only catches up the time

Wa da da da da da da da...
Come on n' boogie
I can funky, you can funky, we can funky...
