If there's a curfew then we all go to jail
'Cause we gon' be
Gettin' illegal, gettin' illegal
Funk ain't no sin
And no, we won't go to hell
It's just illegal (just illegal)

No unscheduled dancin'
No boom boxes
And no live bands
They're all illegal (y'all Breed, y'all Serm I like this way)
No unscheduled dancin'
No boom boxes
And no live bands
They're all illegal
Just illegal

This Funk is cold like the dead middle of winter
Hey Breed!
Hey Serm!
Hey man, make 'em remember
Let's take a journey
Dip thru the Funk land
Hey my man, don't you brothers understand?
Never get caught without the P-Funk
Yeah, we're rollin' all day and Cherokee drunk
That's the only thing that can move me
It's on the poppin'
Ain't no stoppin', word up, yeah!
