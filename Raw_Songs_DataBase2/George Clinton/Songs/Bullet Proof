All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music
Loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain
I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain

I don't want your war
I don't like the boom and bang (ooh)
I don't want to play
I don't like the songs you sing (ooh)

The whole world
Is on red alert
Believe me when I say
No one has to get hurt

I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain (ooh)

La la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la

Everyday I read the paper
There's a brand new hot spot
A so-and-so somewhere
Wanna take what so-and-so's got

I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war

I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war

All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain!
(Not for nobody)

On the subway, everyone's holdin
Even' mugger's gettin mugged
With all they're holdin in
There's no room for love

All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music
Loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain
