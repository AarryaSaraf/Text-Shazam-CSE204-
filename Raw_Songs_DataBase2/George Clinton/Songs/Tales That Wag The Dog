It takes more than a collar, a chain to restrain me
You tried to muzzle me
No shame in my game, speaking but no spoken to
Tweakin' off a toke or two

That dope's teasingly teasin'
Teasin' my nose
This dope's pleasingly pleasin' and
I'm pleasingly froze
All wired up but I'm hangin'
I heard bells ringin'
If you slingin', this mobile dope dog knows

Bow-wow-wow goes the yippee yea yo track
And I'm back
Storytellin' about the payroll stack
That I'm out to get loud about
Who cares about the anything whatsoever
To do or to pursue, fuck it
I bark about you, punk, high rollers
Cold duckits
Yea, I'm spillin' the beans on the kingpins
And drugloards
Just say no, my ass, this is a drug war
Punk nigga need you ask, do I need?
How can you help me fool?
Just gimme somthin' I can say you simps
Tried to sell me
Yea, my mission is to point you out
He got it there it goes toss his punk ass in the pen

His defense position is irrelevant
And all I'll want is the fuckin' evidence
So I can come up and bust the high beam tweak
So what you got to say for yourself, now?
You caught a case and got that look on your face
More power to the hooskow hours you fittin'
To spend days, weeks, months, years, when will it ever end?

Who the hell ever said that crime don't pay?
All I did was play a part in a raid and
I'm paid in full
Save the bullshit for Bandini I can't wait to
See you go up in smoke
Like I dream of Genie
I'll Jack Jack for his Jill
Yo, we'll take bribes Jack
Shit, let's make a deal
Your nuts and bolts were rusted
Now you busted, your mama's so disgusted
With you and the slap stupid ass
Shit you have tendencies to do cause
You's a damn fool, nigga

I see myself in your shoes sometime
But today I do the dope and you do the time

What you finna to do with that there pooper scooper stupid?
This ain't poop, this is dog shit
And a little bit of it will knock an ol' funk
Junky to his knees, nigga please, ruff ruff
Now dig, fuck the cat, 'cause we smooth
We do the dog, like that
(Tracy's 3 lines)

Now, how's about a fat philly full of that
World War II
And that ahhhll you can
Eat bar-b-que, ruff ruff
You make me beg baby, got me moanin'
Foamin' at the mouth
Peein' 'round your house
And ya bark like you don't know it
Thought I heard your whistle
And I don't blow when my red love shows
And my fleas start tickin'
Don't like to do my own lickin'

This ain't puppy love, I knew that when I
Wagged you down
'Cause I went and bought a collar
With my last dollar
Roll over, I want a titty or two or three, it
Doesn't matter to me
You look good bitch, makin' my neck itch
The smell of your booty is all that and a
Milkbone straight off the gravy train
So what's your name?
They call me 68, cause I'm straight
I wanna do you
Scobbie-doo-be-doobe-doobee-do
But don't be doggin' me out
You doggin' me out

Bitch
You think I'm cute, you wanna cuddle, forget it
Fuck a smooch, get on this dick, bullshit

Ruff ruff
You make me beg baby, got me moanin'
Foamin' at the mouth
Peein' 'round your house
And ya bark like you don't know it
Thought I heard your whistle
And I don't blow when my red love shows
And my fleas start tickin'
Don't like to do my own lickin'

This ain't puppy love, I knew that when I
Wagged you down
'Cause I went and bought a collar
With my last dollar
Roll over, I want a titty or two or three, it
Doesn't matter to me
You look good bitch, makin' my neck itch
The smell of your booty is all that and a
Milkbone straight off the gravy train
So what's your name?
They call me 68, cause I'm straight
I wanna do you
Scobbie-doo-be-doobe-doobee-do
But don't be doggin' me out

That dope's teasingly teasin'
Teasin' my nose
This dope's pleasingly pleasin' and
I'm pleasingly froze
All wired up but I'm hangin'
I heard bells ringin'
