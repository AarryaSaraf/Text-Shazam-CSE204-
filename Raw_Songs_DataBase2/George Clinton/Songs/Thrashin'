Molested
Protested
Arrested
And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres

Fail-safe, defcon
Missiles set to cruise
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

Short range deployment
It promotes long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Never gonna blow a groove
Take cover in the groove
We'll be thrashin' on you

Boom shake la ka la ka boom boom
Shake la ka la ka boom boom boom
Boom shake la ka la ka boom boom
Shake la ka la ka boom boom boom

Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

Short range deployment
Oh yes, it promotes long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
We'll be thrashin' on you

Thrash, thrash, thrash
Thrash, thrash, thrash
We'll be thrashin' on you
Thrash, thrash, thrash

Take no prisoners, show no mercy
And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
We'll be thrashin' on you
Molested
Invested
Protested
Ingested
Arrested
And the missile business mushrooms
On all the mother's hemispheres

Short range deployment
It promotes
Long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
Oh, no!

Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove

And the missile business booms
Say "boom!"
On all the mother's hemispheres
Boom!...

Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove
Take cover in the groove

There's no business
Like blow business
Like bomb business
Like boom!
