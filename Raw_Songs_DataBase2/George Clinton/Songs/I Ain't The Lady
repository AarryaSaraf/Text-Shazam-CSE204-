All in due time darlin', do time

I ain't the Lady, he ain't the Tramp
Nobody gives a damn if I vamp
I'm just a Bitch who, every once in awhile
Gets the itch for the scratch
That flicks the fleas
Pick the ticks that's tickin' me off
(He's on my back and he's gettin' me off)

Skip to my lou little darlin' fall in line
In due time find, you're the pick of the litter
(The pick of the litter)
Skip to my lou little darlin' fall in line
In due time find (he's a bird dog)

The style is dope and the shit is hot
You bite so much I need a tetanus shot
I got the shit
He's got the dope

And I'm hooked on him you see
La da da dee dee

I ain't the Lady, he ain't the Tramp
Nobody gives a damn if I vamp
I'm just a Bitch
Gets the itch for the scratch
That flicks the fleas
Pick the ticks that's tickin' me off
He flicks them off

Black bitch, white bitch, flea bite, all scratch
Black bitch, white bitch, flea bite, all scratch
Black bitch, white bitch, flea bite, all scratch
Black bitch, white bitch, flea bite, all scratch

(Skip to my lou little darlin' fall in line in due
Time find)

All start to ichin'. Male dog, he dog, boy dog
Pup...all sons of bitches

I ain't the lady, he ain't the Tramp
Nobody gives a damn if I vamp
I'm just a bitch
He wanna scratch my itch

And, YO!
The dope dog-a-delic wit the shit that be
Jumpin' and pumpin' well, the fuckin' track, it be humpin
Put the nine-trey aside for the 9-4 flow
And you know that he funk for the 9-4-HO!
So with 'nuff respect due to he...The funky
George C., skip your mutha-fuckin' lou to
This fat ass beat
