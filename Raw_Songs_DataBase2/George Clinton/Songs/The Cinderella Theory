You went skinny dippin'
You left your wet suit drippin'
On a tree
You were exoteric
It was so esoteric
It just had to be

We spoke of love through our eyes
Attracted, drawn or magnetized
You smiled at me
I turned my head to see
Still on the tree
It occurred to me
She had nothing on

Oh I, oh no, oh no

Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
It's the Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
If they fit it was you
I've been lookin' for

Oh I, oh no, oh no

Enthusiastically, desperately and eagerly
I searched for you
I'll be the FBI, the CIA
I'll even be a bloodhound, too
Sniff, sniff, sniffin'

Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
It's the Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
If they fit it was you
I've been lookin' for
