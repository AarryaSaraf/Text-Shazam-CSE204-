Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call
Ahhh, ahh-ah-ahhhhh, hear my mother call

I was one of five born to my mother
An older sister and three young brothers
We've seen it hard, we've seen it kind of rough
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that life was really tough

I can hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She said, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong"
Then the devil sang

"Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop
Would you like to dance with me?
We're doin' the cosmic slop"

She was well known through the ghetto
Tricks would come and then they'd go
The neighbors would talk and call her Jezebel
But always with a smile, she was sure to try to hide
The fact from us that she was catching hell, hey!

Hear my mother call
I can hear my mother call
Late at night I hear her call
Oh lord, lord I hear her call
She says, "Father, father it's for the kids
Any and every thing I did
Please, please don't judge me too strong
Lord knows I meant no wrong
Lord knows I meant no wrong"
