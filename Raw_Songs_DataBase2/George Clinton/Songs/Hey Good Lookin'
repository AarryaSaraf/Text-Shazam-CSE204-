Excuse me if I gawk, if I balk
If there's a pause in my talk
You've got me tongue-tied, girl
(Hey, good lookin')
Pardon me if I flip, if I trip
If my composure sort of slips
(Hey, good lookin')
Please don't fret if I freak
The sight of you got me geeked
(Hey good lookin')
Oh, forgive me if I stare
You must be aware
I've been buggin' about your beauty, baby baba
And I bet ya! (Hey, good lookin')
You've got me gawkin', balkin', trippin'
Flippin', buggin', frettin', freakin'
Goin' ga-ga-goo-ga
Yeah you got me geeked

(What are you doin'?)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh...
You know you look marvelous!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh good lookin'
Oh, oh, oh good lookin'

Good lookin', look good to me (oh girl)
You look good to me (yer fine, girl)
Good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
You got me gawkin', balkin', trippin'
Flippin', buggin', frettin', freakin'
(Buggin', frettin', freakin', oh child)
Good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
Excuse me if I gawk, if I balk
If there's a pause in my talk
(Hey, good lookin')
Not one to intellectualize
But then you come to realize
That it's hard to verbalize
What it is you visualize, baby
Pardon me if I trip, if I flip
If my composure sort of slips
(Hey, good lookin')

Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
(Please don't fret)
Hey good lookin', look good to me

And you're lookin' so good to me
You know you look marvelous
Pardon me if I trip, if I flip
