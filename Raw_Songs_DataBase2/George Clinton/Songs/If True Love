If true love is sacred
Mine is yours always forever
It pleases me to pray that
Home you'll come one day back to me
Each and everyday my... love for you grows stronger, baby
If true is sacred
Yours inspired love

You're so easy to love
Easy to love, you're so easy to love... your love
There lying still next to your lover not you early in the morning
Ohh... what a thrill to be lovers to you
Ain't no need to call it

If there's a cure for this here feeling in my heart
Please send it here as though your love were my doctor
Love diagnosed, it exposed, a broken heart
Although, I miss you so
Still adore, love so glad, you're always on my mind
Ooh... come to the dance, sporting a sweetheart or two
Make your baby jealous
Give me the chance, give me the chance
To play around on you, To play around on you
You're not the only fellow no
If there's a cure for this here feeling in my heart
Although, I miss you so
Still adore, love for you is always on my mind

If true love is sacred
If true love is sacred
Love, if true love is sacred

Love so glad, you're always on my mind
Love, umm, umm
Love make your baby jealous
There lying still next to my lovers
You're not the only fellow
Make your baby jealous, make your baby jealous
Love, ohh, what a thrill to be your lover
You're not the only fellow
To make your baby jealous
