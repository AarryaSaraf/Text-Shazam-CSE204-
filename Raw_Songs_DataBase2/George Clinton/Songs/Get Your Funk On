Oh, everybody
How you can look I'm trying hard
To find out the rhythm and the rhyme
The Mothership has just started
To travel the Milky Way
All along the constellations to play
Everytime I'm writing a song
Everytime I'm writing a song
Everytime I try to feel right with my soul
The only thing that comes to me
I'm trying hard to find out the rhythm and the rhyme
But the only thing that comes to me

Get your funk on, get your funk on, get it
C'mon, c'mon get it
C'mon get the funk that I'm bringin' to you
Got to get my funk on tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on, get it
C'mon, c'mon get it

I'll give it to you
(C'mon, bang the drums)
(C'mon, let's sing on)
C'mon baby, get my funk on tonight
C'mon baby, get my funk on tonight
C'mon baby, get my funk on tonight
C'mon baby, get my funk on tonight

Everytime I try to feel right with my soul
The only thing that comes to me
I'm trying hard to find out the rhythm and the rhyme
But the only thing that comes to me

Get your funk on, get your funk on, get it
C'mon get the funk that I'm bringin' to you
You got to get my funk on tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on, get it
C'mon baby, make me feel alright

The Mothership has just started
Travelling along the whole Universe
A Universe of love, it's what you got to give me
Until you go to paradise
The Mothership has just started
Travelling in the Milky Way

Get your funk on, get your funk on, get your funk on
Get the funk that I'm bringin' to you
Get your funk on, get your funk on, get it
C'mon, get the funk that I'm bringin' to you
Baby, you got to get my funk tonight

Everytime I try to feel right with my soul
The only thing that comes to me
I'm trying hard to find out the rhythm and the rhyme
But the only thing that comes to me

Get your funk on, get your funk on, get your funk on
Get your funk on that I'm bringin' to you
Get your funk on, get your funk on, get your funk on
Get the funk that I'm bringin' to you tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on

C'mon baby, I'm bringin' my funk to you tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on
C'mon get it, I'm bringin' my funk to you tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on
C'mon baby I'm bringin' my funk to you tonight
Get your funk on, get your funk on
C'mon get it, I'm bringin' the funk to you tonight
