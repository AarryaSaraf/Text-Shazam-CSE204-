Yeah, gonna be a first time
We all got together
Oh yeah, I'm feelin' good, yeah

(Well, I'll Be Doggone if I would work all day
And I'll Be Doggone if I would bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone)

Yeah bringin' some of that stash they
Got in the back
I dug up a bone plus a few of those
Nickle doggie bags we used to bury
Told you they'd come in handy
Yeah, why not? It's my idea we got into
Discussion and put it on tape
You see, they taught me how to work this

Kick back and watch that shit
You fucked up; you high
I mean, why not?
Those mutha-fuckers got us runnin' 'round
Here chasin metal rabbits at dog tracks and
Then placin' bets and fadin' 'em
Makin' us do stupid animal tricks
'Bout time we sic them on some shit

(Well, I'll Be Doggone if I would work all day
And I'll Be Doggone if I would bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone)

(It's a doggy affair)

Life is cool here in this canaine
County kennel
With all incidentals paid up front, it's cool

Yeah, y'all come in here, come on in
And what you doin' with that silly muzzle on?

But you spaded bitch, what's happenin'?

Don't act like you don't know what it is
You's a dope dog; you's a police dog
Don't tell me they didn't train you in this shit
How the fuck you gonna follow a trail if you
Don't sniff some of this shit?
It ain't just a scent, goddamn, you gotta get
Some of this shit up your nose
Come get your ass over here, man

(It's a doggy affair)

Now this tape is pretty short so we might
Have to talk this dog shit fast
What's happenin' my dog? Yeah
Yeah, I got a nickle bag, a doggie bag
Been defleaded, been deticked and I got
My rabies shot
I'm ready to bury a bone in this muthafucker
Hey, this is the tale that wagged the dog
Yeah, I wanna know why the muthafuckers
When they say "dog," it sounds like
There's somethin' wrong with that shit
You know and when they say "Bitch." Bitch
But they always do a lot of silly shit
But I got a little even the other day
Took some of that
Muthafuckin' shaving cream
Put it around my mouth
Struck my Kujo pose next to the baby
Scared the shit outta that mutha-fucker

Almost bust my side in
Fuck them mutha-fuckers
Well, I got nuthin' to worry about
Kids'll fuck them up if they try to
Do somethin' to me
But you know you gotta get a little even
Every now and then
What? What would I do if I kicked?
Why you ask a silly ass question like that?
Oh yeah, you done start gettin' high now
Now you like talkin', don't you?
What would you do if I catch, catch the cat
That mutha-fucker?

Roof was on top of the house
Roof was on top of your mouth
