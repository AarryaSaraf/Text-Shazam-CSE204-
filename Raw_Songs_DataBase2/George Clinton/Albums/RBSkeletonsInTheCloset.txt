// Hey Good Lookin' //

Excuse me if I gawk, if I balk
If there's a pause in my talk
You've got me tongue-tied, girl
(Hey, good lookin')
Pardon me if I flip, if I trip
If my composure sort of slips
(Hey, good lookin')
Please don't fret if I freak
The sight of you got me geeked
(Hey good lookin')
Oh, forgive me if I stare
You must be aware
I've been buggin' about your beauty, baby baba
And I bet ya! (Hey, good lookin')
You've got me gawkin', balkin', trippin'
Flippin', buggin', frettin', freakin'
Goin' ga-ga-goo-ga
Yeah you got me geeked

(What are you doin'?)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh...
You know you look marvelous!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh good lookin'
Oh, oh, oh good lookin'

Good lookin', look good to me (oh girl)
You look good to me (yer fine, girl)
Good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
You got me gawkin', balkin', trippin'
Flippin', buggin', frettin', freakin'
(Buggin', frettin', freakin', oh child)
Good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
Excuse me if I gawk, if I balk
If there's a pause in my talk
(Hey, good lookin')
Not one to intellectualize
But then you come to realize
That it's hard to verbalize
What it is you visualize, baby
Pardon me if I trip, if I flip
If my composure sort of slips
(Hey, good lookin')

Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
(Please don't fret)
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
Please don't fret if I freak
The sight of you got me geeked
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me (so fine!)
Hey good lookin'
Tell me what you got cookin', y'all
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me (quit it!)
Hey good lookin'
Tell me what you got cookin'
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
You got me gawkin', balkin', trippin'
Flippin', buggin', frettin', freakin'
Goin' ga-ga-goo-ga
Yeah you got me geeked
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me (so fine)
Hey good lookin', look good to me (quit it!)
You look good to me

Oh, you're a sight for sore eyes, girl
And you're lookin' so good to me
You know you look marvelous
Pardon me if I trip, if I flip
If my composure sort of slips
Please don't fret if I freak
The sight of you got me geeked

Well, well, well
Pardon me if I trip, if I flip
If my composure sort of slips
Hey good lookin', look good to me
You look good to me
Oh, forgive me if I stare
But you must be made aware
'Cause I've buggin' about your beauty, baby baba
That's what I'm talkin' about, sing!
You got me gawkin', balkin, trippin'
Flippin', buggin, frettin', freakin'
Goin' ga-ga-goo-ga
Yeah you got me geeked
Yeah girl, like in the way you walk
Oh, and talk girl
Ga-ga-ga-ga...
Forgive me if I stare
But you must be made aware
I've buggin' about your beauty, baby baba
Forgive me if I stare
But you must be made aware
I've buggin' about your beauty, baby baba
You got me gawkin', balkin', trippin', (ga-ga-ga)
Flippin', buggin, frettin', freakin' (ga-ga)
Goin' ga-ga-goo-ga

The sight of you gets me geeked!
Please don't fret if I freak
The sight of you gets me geeked!
Please don't fret if I freak!

// Do Fries Go With That Shake? //

You know you look marvelous!
Oh oh, oh oh...
Oh oh, oh oh...
Oh oh, oh oh... oh oh

Oh, I said the damndest things
Last night when I was runnin' games
I said "Baby, can I cut your cake?"
Oh, can I have it my own way
Don't I deserve a break today?
Them burns, I like the way you bake
Runnin' fever at a hundred and ten

Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake!?

He says that he possessed the beef
One quarter pounder just for me
A Whopper, that's sure to "satisfry"
He called me Legs McMuffin
And he ordered a kiss
I said I'll take a filet of this
Please don't fry it!

Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?

Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?

You know you look marvelous!

I'm a fast food junkie and I need a fix
Without your sugar I'm gonna be sick
So don't try it
Oh, it's calorie-free and nutrasweet
The love of you has gotten me
On a diet

Oh, do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake!?
Do fries go with that shake?

Oh oh, oh oh...

Oh, he says the damndest things
Last night when he was runnin' games
He said "Baby, can I cut your cake?"
Oh, can I have it my way
Don't I deserve a break today
Them burns, I like the way you bake
Runnin' fever at a hundred and ten

You know you look marvelous!
Oh oh, oh oh...
Oh oh, oh oh...

He called me Legs McMuffin
And he ordered a kiss
I said I'll take a filet of this
Please don't fry it!
I'm in possession of the beef
One quarter pounder
Check and see
McWhopper, that's sure to "satisfry"

Do fries go with that shake?

You know you look marvelous!
(Do fries go with that shake?) Do fries, do fries...

// Mix-Master Suite //

That's so hot...

There is a D.J. in your town
Who calls himself Mix Master
He says there is none as great as he
There'll be none in the hereafter
He spins, he scratch, he mixes the sounds
We all wanna hear
Spyro-gyro type of sound
That's strange to the ear

And then he goes downtown and get down with it
He be throwin' down, but you gotta be down to get it
He mix 'em up and turns them out

There is a D.J. in your town
Who calls himself Sir Rapper
He rap about this, and rap about that
That's why he's called The Rapper
He's all rapped up into his rap
That's all we ever hear
Spyro-gyro kind of sound
That's strange to the ear

And then he goes downtown and get down with it
He be throwin' down, but you gotta be down to get it
He runs his rap and raps it up

There is a D.J. on the air
We all know his location
He plays a tune, and says "stay tuned"
Right here on this station
He spins, he scratch, he mixes the sounds
We all love to hear
Spyro-gyro type of sound
That's strange to the ear

And then he goes downtown and get down with it
He be throwin' down, but you gotta be down to get it
He mixes down and raps it up
He runs his rap and raps it up

The roof, the roof, the roof ain't on fire!
You don't need no water, there'll be nothin' left to burn!

Step to decide...
Step to decide...

Downtown and get down with it
He be throwin' down, but you gotta be down to get it
He mixes down and raps it up
He runs his rap and raps it up

The roof, the roof, the roof ain't on fire!
You don't need no water, there'll be nothin' left to burn!

Step to decide...
That's so hot...
Step to decide...

The roof, the roof, the roof ain't on fire!
You don't need no water, there'll be nothin' left to burn!

Step to decide...
That's so hot...
That's so hot...

The roof, the roof, the roof ain't on fire!
You don't need no water, there'll be nothin' left to burn!
One nation under a groove...

The roach, the roach, the roach is on the wall
You don't need no Raid, let the mother funker crawl!
Crawl, mother funker!

That's so hot...
Eh dirty fish, you're on!
Step to decide...
Step to decide...
Hot, that's so hot...

// Cool Joe //

I once had a friend
His name was Joe
Joe sho' was cold
He said "I'll be a mack
I drive a Cadillac
Carry money in a sack, Joe"

Right on, Joe
Joe sho' was cold

As time went on, seen Joe
Joe sho' was cold
He drives a Cadillac
With three girls in the back
(Girls in the back)
He carried money in a sack
He had his hair laid back

Right on, Joe!
Joe sho' was cold

And as time went on, seen Joe
And Joe still was cold
He said "My rent is due
And my car note too
But I ain't worried
Cos my women will have it by afternoon"

Right on, Joe!
Joe sho' was cold
Cold Joe
On the other side
Of Cool Joe - Cold Joe

And as time went on
I got worried about Joe
And I asked Joe, I said
"Why you spent all your money on the blow?"
He said "'Cause I'm a mack
I drive a Cadillac
With three girls in the back
And see, I like it like that!"

Said right on, Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
What cha gon' do?
Joe sho' was cold

As time went on, seen Joe
This time Joe was all outta dough
No Cadillac, no girls in the back
He had no money in a sack
Joe, poor Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
I thought I told you so, uh
What cha gon' do, Joe?
Poor Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
I told you so
What cha gon' do, Joe...?

// R&B Skeletons (In The Closet) //

Only playin' the class gigs
Never makin' it to the bridge
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet
Sing and play, but never shout
For if we do, we would let it out
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet

Though he's crossed over
He's definitely from down under the bridge
He used to take it there
Songs we used to sing, things we used to do
Ah, we do no more

Party started long ago
But there's no one on the floor
Get that classic R&B out the closet
"Sex Machine" by James Brown
Funkadelic throwin' down
Don't you know that's how the party started?

Though he's crossed over
He's definitely from down under the bridge
He used to take you there
Songs we used to sing, things we used to do
Ah, we don't do no more!

Only play the class gigs
Never takin' it to the bridge
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet
Sing and play, but never shout
Never really turnin' it out
R&B skeletons in the closet

Party started long ago
But there's no one on the floor
Get that classic R&B out the closet
"Sex Machine" by James Brown
Funkadelic throwin' down
They know how to get a party started!
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet

He used to take you there...
