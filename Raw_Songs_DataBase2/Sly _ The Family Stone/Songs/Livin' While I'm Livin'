Remember the day, remember the way
That we were partners, what you say, hey, hey
Remember the songs, what's all you done with me
Remember we'd done, with the violence oh well
To get what you made, to get you a date
Without your feedback a trippin'
Get the thing straight, someone'd play
If you're sleepin' stepin' back in

Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'

Standin' around, standin' look out
While I shivered, don't you say that
Me with the mouth, tellin' the south
I wouldn't, oh wowow
Takin' the town, takin' the gun and the winner
Makin' your mind, makin' my find, a beginner

Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'

Show me the brain, that wanted to train
You to make it
Trouble to me, you needed to see
You shake it

Say it brother
Livin' while I'm livin'
