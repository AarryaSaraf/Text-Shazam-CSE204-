I've made a mistake in this room
I did something I had to do
I wish that I was dreamin'
So, I could wake up and, wooo...
Wake up and love you, oh yeah

I'm sorry but you pushed me too hard
You walked all over me
It seemed like you were jesting
To see if I could be

If this room could talk
You would know that I love you
I need you
I want you, and furthermore
I got to have you
I got to have you, oh yeah
I got to have you, oh yeah
I got to have you, yeah

I know you don't expect me to call you
If this room won't give me a hand
I would rather be without you
Cause I would be less than a wooo
Less than a man, ooh yeah
Less than a man

If this room could talk
You would know that I love you
I need you
I want you, and furthermore
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to have you, ooh yeah
I got to, ooh yeah
