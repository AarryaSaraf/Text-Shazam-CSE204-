It's about my heart
Kind of shaky inside
It's about my tears
I can't even hide

No, no, no

It's about my future
That I can't focus in
It's all about my past
And the times that I spent with her

I hate to love her
It's no fun
I would leave her
If I could

She doesn't love me
She can't even fake it
She won't respect me
If I stay I won't live another day
No, no, no

It's all about my baby
It's all about my
Why won't she be honest
And leave me behind to get over her

I hate to love her
I must hate myself
I hate to love her
It's bad for my health
