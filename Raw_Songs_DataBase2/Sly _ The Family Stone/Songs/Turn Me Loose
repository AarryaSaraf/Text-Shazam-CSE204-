Loose, two, three, four

Turn me loose, you got my mind
You got my body, you got my soul
Turn me loose, I'm incomplete
She got my heart, I'm out of control

You tell me to leave I like you
If you tell me stay I hate you
Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose

Turn me loose, I'm feelin' down
I'm on the ground, you turn me around
Turn me loose, hey, I feel so bad
I'm going to say, I feel this way

You tell me to leave I'll thank you
If you tell me stay I hate you
Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose

Turn me loose, I, I, I gotta keep on movin'
Turn me loose, I don't like to groove
Turn me loose, you hangin' my mind up
Turn me loose, I don't believe you

You tell me to leave I'll thank you, sir
If you let me stay I'll hate you

Turn me loose, keep on
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
