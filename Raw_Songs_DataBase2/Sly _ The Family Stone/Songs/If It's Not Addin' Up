When it's not addin' up
Baby, you should multiply
Everything that they subtract
If they know something we should try

Choosin' ways we're livin' in
It gives so many reasons to play
If your vision starts givin' in
When you need it most to stay
Looks like it's not addin' up
Looks like it's not addin' up
Seems it's not addin' up
Looks like it's not addin' up

Although Mom she raised no fool
Like all guys I'm tryin' to blame
Little no no's tryin' to be cool
And she's the one that gave me my name
If it's not addin' up
If it's not addin' up
Seems it's not addin' up, y'all
Seems it's not addin' up

ABC to XYZ
What a pretty alphabet
When you're finding out and you see
It has stopped and where it is yet
If it's not adding up
It seems it's not adding up
If it's not addin' up
If it's not addin' up

Don't you think like it's not addin' up
