I can't strain my brain
I know how it feels to worry all the time
I can't take the pain
I know how it feels to worry over, just a dime

Yes, I guess it was me, for us to guess
That we're gonna have to be free
Keep on runnin', when you feel her
Pullin' back you're goin' strong
Don't stop runnin' if you're real
You'll never slack, you got to go on

Yes, I guess it was me, for us to guess
That we're gonna have to be free

Can't strain my brain
When I feel somebody tryin' to bring me down
Won't take the rain
Don't you know you'll never catch me lyin' down

Can't bust a man
If he feels he makes it easier to see
Can't trust a man
And trust can take the lovin' out of me yeah

Yes pleasure was made, for us to see
Guess, that were just gonna have to be free

Can't strain my brain
Can't take the rain
Damn this pain
You don't remain
