Bo bo bo bo bo when you want to
Shine it on

They may not like the way you walk
They may not listen when you talk
But... will understand
If what you're doin'
If what you're doin' is all you can

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

Sometimes the pressure could feel like tons
But keep on stickin', stickin' to your guns
When you're tryin' to do your best
Don't you worry, worry, worry about the mess

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on

One ounce of label is all they need
And a pound of care you give indeed
But when they notice only one gram
You can assume they don't give a damn

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on






Sometimes the pressure could feel like tons
But keep on stickin' to your guns
When you're tryin', when you're tryin'
To do your best
Don't you worry about the mess
Shine it on

Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
Shine it on, shine it on
When you want to

We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
We want to, we've got to
We want to shine it on
