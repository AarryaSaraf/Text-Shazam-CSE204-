Album: Stand

// Stand! //

Stand 
In the end you'll still be you 
One that's done all the things you set out to do 
Stand 
There's a cross for you to bear 
Things to go through if you're going anywhere 
Stand 
For the things you know are right 
It s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight 
Stand 
All the things you want are real 
You have you to complete and there is no deal 
Stand. stand, stand 
Stand. stand, stand 
Stand 
You've been sitting much too long 

There's a permanent crease in your right and wrong 
Stand 
There's a midget standing tall 
And the giant beside him about to fall 
Stand. stand, stand 
Stand. stand, stand 
Stand 
They will try to make you crawl 
And they know what you're saying makes sense and all 
Stand 
Don't you know that you are free 
Well at least in your mind if you want to be 

Everybody 
Stand, stand, stand

// Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey //

Don't call me nigger, whitey
Don't call whitey, nigger

Well, I went down across the country
Ana I heard the voices ring
People talkin' softly to each other
And not a word could change a thing

// Somebody's Watching You //

Pretty, pretty, pretty as a picture
Witty, witty, witty as you can be
Blind 'cause your eyes see only glitter
Closed to the things that make you free
Ever stop to think about a downfall?
Happens at the end of every line
Just when you think you've pulled a fast one
Happens to the foolish all the time

Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Games are to played with toys, et cetera
Love is to be made when you're for real
Ups and downs are caused by life in general
Some are yours no matter how you feel
Shady as a lady in a mustache
Feelings camouflaged by groans and grins
Secrets have a special way about them
Moving to and fro among your friends

Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

Live it up today if you want to
Live it down tomorrow afternoon
Sunday school don't make you cool forever
Neither does the silver of your spoon
The nicer the nice, the higher the price
This is what you pay for what you need
The higher the price, the nicer the nice
Jealous people like to see you bleed

Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody, somebody's watching you)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Watching you)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you (Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching you

// Everyday People //

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah, yeah

There is a blue one
Who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one
Trying to be a skinny one
Different strokes
For different folks

And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha
We got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same, whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a long hair
That doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one
That will not help the poor one
Different strokes
For different folks

And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha
We got to live together

There is a yellow one
That won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one
Different strokes
For different folks

And so on and so on
And scooby dooby dooby
Oh sha sha
I am everyday people

// You Can Make It If You Try //

You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
Push a little harder
Think a little deeper
Don't let the plastic bring you down

All together now
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try

Time is still creeping
Specially when you're sleeping
Wake up and go for what you know

All together now
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try

You'll get what's due you
And everything coming to you
You got to move if you want to be ahead

All together now
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
