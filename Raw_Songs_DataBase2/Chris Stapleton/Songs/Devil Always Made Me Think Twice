Take a little smoke in the evening
Take a little whiskey on ice
I never get behind on killin' my mind
It's just the kind of things I like
Just the kind of things I like

The minute that I saw you walkin' over
I figured I was diggin' my grave
And you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble
But you're just the kind of trouble I crave
Just the kind of trouble I crave

And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think

Some day I'm goin' six feet under
And when they got me standin' at the gate
They'll tally up my sins and won't let me in
Sayin' "Son, you're just a little too late
Son, you're just a little too late"

And mama always set a good example
Daddy always gave me good advice
Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
But the devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me think twice

Devil always made me, devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice
Devil always made me, devil always made me
Devil always made me think twice
