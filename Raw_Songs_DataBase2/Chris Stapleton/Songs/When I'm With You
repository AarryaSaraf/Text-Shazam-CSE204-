I'm forty years old
And it looks like the end of the rainbow
Ain't no pot of gold
The things that I've done
I doubt anyone will remember
After I'm gone

The places I've been
There's some I'd go back to
And some where I won't go again
And most of the time
I'm feelin' like I'm fadin' into the night

But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you

I got a good job
And I'm thankful to be workin'
When so many good people are not
Sometimes I can't stand
How my back and my hands
They won't work like they used to

Somewhere in my mind
I'm still searchin' for something
I know that I'm not gonna find
When I know for sure
I've got so much more
Than a man ever needs

But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you

I'm forty years old
And it looks like the end of the rainbow
Ain't no pot of gold
