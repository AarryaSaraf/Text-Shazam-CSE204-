Sittin' here
It's closing time
You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye

I know a way can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
Nobody's lonely tonight

What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

You'll be her
And I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight
