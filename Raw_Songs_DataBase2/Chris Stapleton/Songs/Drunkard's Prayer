I get drunk and talk to God
I say I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
And I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I tell him why we're through
I tell him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say, "I can't be alone"
And he'll say, "Son, you're on your own"
'Cause when I talk to God I tell him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine, all mine
I know he's a busy man, he'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God I thank him for the time

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

Oh, when I get drunk and talk to God
