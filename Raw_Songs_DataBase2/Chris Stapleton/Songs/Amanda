I've held it all in, God knows I've tried
It's an awful awakening in a country boy's life
Look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife

It's a measure of people who don't understand
The pleasures of life in a hillbilly band
Got my first guitar when I was fourteen
Now I'm pushin' forty and I'm still wearin' jeans

Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
Amanda, light of my life
Faith should have made you a gentleman's wife
