// Back To Texas //

I need some real air to breathe
I hate the way they look at me
A part of me is so far away
And I miss that Southern sky

Love took me where you wanted to go
Down a real bad stretch of road
You leave me here most every night
I can't stand this cold

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

Give me a one-light town
Put me in a front porch swing
Give me a Gold Star in that Texas bar
That's the way it should be

Lord knows how you're gonna end
And I won't let you pull me in
I've spent too long away from what I know

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

I'm going back to Texas
Take me home
I'm going home, I'm going home

// Honkytonk Heartache //

A two-step soothes my broken heart
A fiddle kills the pain
The neon lights, they ease my mind
'Til you come back again

You're gonna tell me that you love me
And make promises you'll break
But until then I'll sit alone
With a honkytonk heartache

Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left

Well that bottle of good whiskey
Couldn't drive you from my head
And it can't erase the memory
Of her there in our bed

Comin' home without you is just
More than I can take
I'm gonna wash down your memory
With this honkytonk heartache

Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left
I'm gonna feel this in the morning, this honkytonk heartache

// Halfway To Memphis //

I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
Take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you
You drove me outta' my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

Instead of wastin' my time trying to make you feel good
I'm gonna see what kinda' life is up in front of my hood
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]
I'm halfway gone but I'm halfway saved
A couple hundred miles from a brand new day
Halfway there is a damn good start from a worn out mind
To a healed-up heart
Thank God I'm finally comin' to my senses
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

I can drive away far and I can run pretty fast
The plan for my future's puttin' you in my past
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

So don't bother to call and don't bother to write
Cuz' freedom's just ahead in the beam of my lights
You drove me outta my mind and I'm halfway to Memphis

[Chorus]

I've made up my mind and what I'm gonna do
You can take it or leave it boy, I'm leavin' you

// Nothing More //

Well the bedroom lights finally went out for the night
The ringing in my ears from all your bitchin' has finally gone quiet
Can't watch TV for five minutes without the changing the channel again
I'm sick and tired of fightin' over Springer and Rosanne

I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

You drank all the Keystone and you smoked my last cigarette
Went on a shopping spree at the dollar store, put us a little bit further in debt
The sun came up this morning and I thought about how things have been
Baby, take a good look at this face 'cause you ain't gonna see it again

'Cause I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I want nothing more than less of you

// Heart Of Gold //

I wanna live, I wanna give
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
It's these expressions I never give
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been admired by, it's such a fine light
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

Keep me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm growing old

// Next Time //

I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you
I've got twenty bucks and this road ahead
Plenty of time to clear my head
And I know, I don't need you

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time

I'm staring down at these white lines
They're taking me further and passing the time
I know, I don't need you
You had one last chance and you threw it away
It don't matter what I've gotta say
And I know, I don't need you

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
Toughen up and be more outspoken
I know more than I did back then
I won't let my heart get broken
There is a next time

Next time I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open
Test the water before I jump in
I'm gonna toughen up and be more outspoken
More than I was back then
I won't let my heart get broken

I've gotten this far on my own
I don't have anything set in stone
I know, I don't need you

// Whispers Of Your Name //

Maybe I won't find
Any old love letters
Maybe I won't wish
You'd come down the hall
Maybe my picture frames
Won't look so empty
I have to take 'em down
Off the wall
Maybe the rain will come
After I'm sleeping
Maybe in my dreams
I won't feel this pain
Maybe I'll find my way
Back to morning
Without hearing whispers of your name
Maybe I'll find some things
To keep my mind busy
Maybe I'll sell this car
Sell this ol' ring
Maybe that'll be enough
To finally convince me
That you're not here
And I really don't have anything
Maybe I'll try
Try to get out some
Maybe our favorite places
Will still feel the same
Maybe when I sit alone
At our old table
I won't hear whispers of your name
I won't hear whispers of your name

// Pieces //

Dance around 
A little flame 
Candles burn out your name
Empty chair
Stands so bold
Your not here anymore

I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again 
I live in pieces

Everyday makes a hole an it
Tears away at my tired soul
I don't sleep (I can't sleep without you)
And I can't cry (I'm always crying) 
Empty house full glass of wine

I live my life from lie to lie
And I'm a train wreck on the the inside
I wish I could be but I think I am
Over you and up again 
I live in pieces

Dance around a little flame
Candles burn out your name
