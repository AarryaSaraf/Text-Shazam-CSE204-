Grew up in the sticks where there ain't no light
But the stars were big and bright
If they told me no
I would always wonder why

But I tried to be good
And keep my head down
But there was too much sky around
And my daddy said

Keep lookin' up
Don't let the world bring you down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

They come to me in different ways
Beautiful and strange
I've seen fire burning in the sky
Things that I can't explain
I've seen truth step into the light
And true love turn into pain

But I keep looking up
Won't let the world bring me down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

You never know what you may find
I've seen strange things happen all the time
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Oh, keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
