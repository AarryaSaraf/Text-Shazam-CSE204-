You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You've got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
And when you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You've got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Winter is so gray, it's like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
And I love the way you decorate my heart
