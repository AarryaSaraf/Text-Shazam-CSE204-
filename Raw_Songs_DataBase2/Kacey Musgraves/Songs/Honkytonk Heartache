A two-step soothes my broken heart
A fiddle kills the pain
The neon lights, they ease my mind
'Til you come back again

You're gonna tell me that you love me
And make promises you'll break
But until then I'll sit alone
With a honkytonk heartache

Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left

Well that bottle of good whiskey
Couldn't drive you from my head
And it can't erase the memory
Of her there in our bed

Comin' home without you is just
More than I can take
I'm gonna wash down your memory
With this honkytonk heartache

Honkytonk heartache, sittin' on this bar stool by myself
Honkytonk heartache, yeah, I just can't seem to shake it since you left
I'm gonna feel this in the morning, this honkytonk heartache
