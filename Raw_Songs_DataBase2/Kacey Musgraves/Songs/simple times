Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone all night
Didn't know it was a simple time

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh

I think I'm going off of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw everybody a peace sign
Put all the static on silent
We could stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh

There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh
