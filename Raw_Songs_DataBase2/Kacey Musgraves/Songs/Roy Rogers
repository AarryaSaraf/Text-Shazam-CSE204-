Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
So, you draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, and five o'clock evenings
I'd liven up the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham on my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do you no good
So I laid my chair, close my eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
'Cause Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
And everyone else is in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
So turn on the TV, and shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Tonight

Turn on the TV, and shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
