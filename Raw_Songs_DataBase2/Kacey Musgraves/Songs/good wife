Let's go back to the beginning
I just wanna be a good wife

Wake him up nice and slow
Bring him coffee in bed
Listen to his problems
Tell him that I understand
Touch him so he knows in his heart he's the only one
Try to loosen up and be more fun
Yeah, I could be more fun

God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
He still needs me

Help me let go of all the things that make me mad
At the end of the day, he's gotta know that I've got his back
And if he comes home stressed out, I could pack him a bowl
Just let him be himself, don't try to control

God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
Yeah, he still needs me

And the truth is
I could probably make it on my own
But without him
This house just wouldn't be a home
And I don't wanna be alone

God, help me be a good wife
Yeah, 'cause he needs me
And even when he's not right
I know he still needs me

Help me be a good wife
'Cause I need him
Ooh, And I know, I know, I know
Yeah, I know, I know, I know
That I need him

Help me be a good wife
I just wanna be a good wife
