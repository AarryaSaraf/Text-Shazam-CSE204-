Here I go breakin' my own heart again
I didn't know that things could get this outta hand
If I called home right now, I'd guarantee
I'd get my share of advice that I don't want, but I might need

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
And they can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I got dreams and I don't really wanna put 'em down
That boy can't see past the edges of this town
And I'm not hangin' around

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I know the truth is that they're usually right, but
I gotta point this steering wheel my own way
Tonight 'cause

Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop my reachin' for all the livin' I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road
I got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah
