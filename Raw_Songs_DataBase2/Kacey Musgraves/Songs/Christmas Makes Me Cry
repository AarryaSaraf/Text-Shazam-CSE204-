It feels like we're supposed to be happy during the holidays
But, sometimes they just make you really sad
So, I wrote this song for anybody that might be feeling a little bit lonely

It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

It seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

And they always say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always
