I need some real air to breathe
I hate the way they look at me
A part of me is so far away
And I miss that Southern sky

Love took me where you wanted to go
Down a real bad stretch of road
You leave me here most every night
I can't stand this cold

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

Give me a one-light town
Put me in a front porch swing
Give me a Gold Star in that Texas bar
That's the way it should be

Lord knows how you're gonna end
And I won't let you pull me in
I've spent too long away from what I know

You can have these memories
You can try to take me down
You can stay here in hell
As for me, I'm going back to Texas

I'm going back to Texas
Take me home
I'm going home, I'm going home
