Leon Bridges! (Yo)
Come on in (Good to see you, good to see you)
Hey! Thanks for coming
Thanks for having me (Okay)
Honestly, I have nothing ready for Christmas
I didn't know you were coming
Hey, don't sweat it, I'm just here to sing a song

We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hoo hoo

Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you, girl, sippin' on champagne

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, hmm

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hmm
Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl, yeah
Come sit by the fire (Yeah, yeah)
