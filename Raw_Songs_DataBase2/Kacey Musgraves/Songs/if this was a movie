Am I the stone in your pocket
That's weighing you down?
Or the face in your locket
That you wear all over town?
I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name

If this was a movie
I'd be surprised
Hearing your car
Coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie

If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness
That's inside both of us
And we'd get away
And we'd be okay

If this was a movie
I'd be surprised
Hearing your car
Coming up the drive
Then you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
But it's not a movie
