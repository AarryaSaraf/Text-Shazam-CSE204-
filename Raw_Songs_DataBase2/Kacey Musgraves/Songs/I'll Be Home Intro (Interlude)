Well, that was sweet
Almost as sweet as these cookies
After Kacey finished wrapping gifts, it was time for another duet
And great duets can't happen without great friends.

I really, really appreciate you making the time to come here.
Of course! I'm so happy to be here.
Well, I would love to sing one of my favorite holiday classics with you.
Yes! Let's do it.
'Kay.
