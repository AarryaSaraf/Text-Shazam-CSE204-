I can write a melody, and maybe
I could even make it rhyme
I've never been scared of what I wanted to be, and you know me
I've never been afraid to shine
I built a rocket ship and I went to space
Even way out there, I kept my head on straight
So tell me, why

It ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done

I can wake up with a heart of gold, sometimes
I can be the one you need me to be
Never said that I was easy to hold, but I love you
And I know that you love me

But it ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done
Easier said than done
It's easier said than done

It ain't easy
It should be easy to love someone
We've been tryin'
And we found out
That it's easier said than done
