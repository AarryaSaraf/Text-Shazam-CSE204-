Well the bedroom lights finally went out for the night
The ringing in my ears from all your bitchin' has finally gone quiet
Can't watch TV for five minutes without the changing the channel again
I'm sick and tired of fightin' over Springer and Rosanne

I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

You drank all the Keystone and you smoked my last cigarette
Went on a shopping spree at the dollar store, put us a little bit further in debt
The sun came up this morning and I thought about how things have been
Baby, take a good look at this face 'cause you ain't gonna see it again

'Cause I want nothing more than less of you
The more I hang around, the more hell you put me through
I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you

I used to think things could be changed
But the heartache still remains
I want nothing more than less of you
I want nothing more than less of you
