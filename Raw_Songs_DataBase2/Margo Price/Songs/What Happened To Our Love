He asked you questions only I could answer
You were the music and I was the dancer
You were the medicine and I was the cancer
What happened to our love?

Can't get through, it's not like before
You were the footsteps and I was the floor
Silence grew like a cold, cold war
What happened to our love?

What is this life, and what does it mean?
Time, it runs out and rips at the seams
Like oil in water, hellfire and rain
We fight, we make up, just to make love again

You were the lightning and I was the thunder
Came on like a tidal wave and pulled me under
That kind of chemistry can make anyone wonder
What happened to our love?

You were the flower and I was the rain
You were the needle and I was the vein
You were the blood and I was the stain
When the push came to shove

If anyone here knew me the best
You put me to bed when I needed rest
Came in from the East, burned out in the West
Like a fire from above

Born in the pain, die in the mud
We wander this Earth as we circle the Sun
In time and through space, 'til we're dust in the wind
But I love you so much that I'd find you again, find you again

What is this life, and what does it mean?
Time, it runs out and rips at the seams
Like oil in water, hellfire and rain
We screw, we break up, just to make love again
