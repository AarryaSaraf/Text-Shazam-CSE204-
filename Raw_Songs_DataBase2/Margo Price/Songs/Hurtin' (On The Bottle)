I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I was veering for the white line of the shoulder
Faded lights all cast upon the wall
Baby I know we've been getting older
But you're never too old to learn to crawl

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I met you with your thumb out in the alley
I know no one ever comes around here no more
Been looking for a peak inside the valley
Been searching for a key outside your door

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

Been riding high on low expectations
It's like singing loud with no one left to hear
I've been drinking from the well of inspiration
But it's all falling on these wasted ears

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

Been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me
