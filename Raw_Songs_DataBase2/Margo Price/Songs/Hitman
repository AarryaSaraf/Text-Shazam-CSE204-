This worn-out world, it makes no sense
Going insane out of self-defense
Sell all my shit
Move to the sticks
Be a hitman for hire

Maybe I'll change my name to Ghost
Captain a boat on the northeast coast
Live off of fish
Try to stay afloat
Set the past on fire

Spend my days out burnin' the wind
Wake up hazed, try to do it again
But you can't go back
Where you've never been
Hitman

Sell everything that I ever bought
Rob a bank, hope I don't get caught
Scratch of the VIN
On a car that's hot
Drive it down the line

Desert horse, I'm out 'til dawn
Over the dunes to the setting sun
Making moves
Like Chaka Khan
Running out of time

In this dream you play a part
How can you be who you are?
You're not akin
To who you've been

I want to be reborn again
Rattlesnake that sheds its skin
But you can't go back
To where you've never been
Hitman
