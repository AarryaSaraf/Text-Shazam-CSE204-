I could build a landfill of dreams I deserted
Swallowed up like muscadine wine
I look for the stray wolves out in the distance
They lick their lips on the timberline
Garbage and the ash keep piling up
A catastrophe that is yours and mine
They say it takes time to become timeless
Time is all I've got this time

Once in a while you stop to notice
Something that's been there from the start
I made love and love made me
But only love can tear you apart

The sahara winds blew all the dust in
Little white birds like shells in the sand
No one tells you when you're young you have so much to lose
Until you watch it slip through your hands
I put myself in my own painting
Those mournful blues and a blood red rose
Know the picture's always changing
You can't change how the story goes

Once in a while you stop to notice
Something that's been there from the start
I made love and love made me
But only love can tear you apart
Only love can tear you apart
Love
