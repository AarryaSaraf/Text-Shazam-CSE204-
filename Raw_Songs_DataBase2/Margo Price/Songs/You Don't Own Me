You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't play with other boys

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And when I go out with you, baby
Don't put me on display cuz

You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cuz I'd never stay

I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself, baby
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
Baby I'm free and I need to be free
To live my life the that way I want
To say and do whatever I please cuz

You don't own me
Please keep my body out of your hands
You don't own me
I won't make any other demands

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And please when I go out with you, baby
Don't put me on display
And I'm young and I love to be you
Baby I'm free and I need to be free
To live my life the way that I want
To say and do whatever I please cuz

You don't own me
