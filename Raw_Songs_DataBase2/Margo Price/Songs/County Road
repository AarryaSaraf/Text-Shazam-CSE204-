Hey kid where ya goin' with those brand new wheels you got
You think you're gonna last forever forever says you're not
Won't ya take me down this gravel road and out a little ways
Forget about this prison town and these goddamn summer days
Ever since you went away well it's gotten bad 'round here
Sometimes I wanna see it burn in my rear-view mirror
You're so lucky you made it out and you don't even know
But I still see your car driving up and down County road
County road
County road

I've got this joint let's go get high and shoot a little dice
I'll pour some gin you can buy me in oh wouldn't that be nice
Ever since the storm came through well there's not much left to save
Developers they bought your house they're gonna tear it down in May
I keep waking up from this nightmare dream time cuts like a knife
I wish I could have back what I didn't know were the best years of my life
Maybe I'm lucky I'm already dead and I don't even know
But I still see your headlights runnin' through the trees out on County road
County road

Remember when we got drunk that time in Ontario
Listening to Warren Zevon on the stereo
I keep thinking 'bout that very last night when we went down to the bar
And even though you're no longer here you'll never be that far
Hey kid you know it's been three years since the change
The band broke up the boys don't talk and the city's rearranged
No one's lucky and no one's saved and no one really knows
Why it was you who had to go down like that out on County road
County Road
Why it was you
Why it was you
