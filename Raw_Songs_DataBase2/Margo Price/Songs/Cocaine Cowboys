Well the boys round here ain't like the boys back home
They don't plant the fields, they won't work the farms
The boys round here well they talk too fast
When the times get hard, no they won't last

Cocaine cowboys
They're bad in the saddle
But they're coming from New York, LA, and Seattle
They're all hat, they don't rope no cattle
They don't ride no bulls
Cocaine cowboys, they never get sleep
With their bloodshot eyes, their cigarette teeth
I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys

Well they're riding the rails right before the show
Better call up James when the bag gets low
The crowd thins out the longer they play
You can't write a song with nothing to say

Cause the cocaine cowboys
They're bad in the saddle
But they come in from New York, LA, and Seattle
They're all hat, they don't rope no cattle
They don't ride no bulls
Cocaine cowboys, they never get sleep
They're out in the bars and grinding their teeth
And I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys
And I wish that someone warned me
Stay away from them cocaine cowboys
