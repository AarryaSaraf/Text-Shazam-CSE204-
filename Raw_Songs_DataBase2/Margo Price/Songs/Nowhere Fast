Well I've been traveling so long that I can't go back
Cause I'm too far in
I've got my ticket and my bags are packed
And I miss my child
Lord, I miss my friends
But even they quit calling me on the phone
Asking me how I've been

Maybe I'm to blame for the shape that I'm in
Maybe I'm insane
But I'm leaving you again
Living in the present
Trying to forget the past
I'm going nowhere fast

When the new wears off and you're on the floor
And you can't find your self-respect
But you sure can find the door
All those late-night drives
And those roadside dives
And you can't get a decent meal
Or enough sleep behind your eyes

Maybe I'm to blame for the shape that I'm in
Maybe I'm insane but I'm leaving you again
Living in the present
Trying to forget the past
I'm going nowhere fast
Yes I'm going nowhere fast

Nowhere fast
Nowhere fast
Nowhere fast
