Being born is a curse
Dying young is worse
Finding love is the meaning of life
And in the land of the freedom, invisible chains
You get what you pay for
Sometimes you pay twice
And you go through the motions
Confused and alone
And wonder why truth ain't easy to see
And they put you through school
And tell you you're grown
And put you to work to buy shit you don't need

What's the matter with being a loner
Even a nobody's somebody, too
Even the bums on the street are just dreamers
A face in the crowd no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you

And if you don't fit the mold they call you a failure
You travel too much and they'll say that you're lost
And you can take your pick
You either came from an ape
Or the dad of a magic man up on a cross

And loneliness follows
It's always there with you
Through marriages, mortgages, sickness, and health
And you can fight your whole life to be who you are
Then decide if you'd rather be somebody else

What's the matter with being a loner
Even a nobody's somebody, too
Even the bums on the street are just dreamers
A face in the crowd no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you
Ooh no different than you
