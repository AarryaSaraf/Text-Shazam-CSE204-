I never won at scratch offs but my daddy always bought em
My great-aunt spent her life in Virginia pulling cotton
I don't have no microwave or a flat screen TV
If you don't do right by yourself, you do right by me
Do right by me

Long as the winters are sometimes your mind breaks up
Bars are full by the afternoon and everybody's drunk
Sometimes I look down the road for a sight I'll never see
If you don't do right by yourself, you do right by me
Do right by me

Do right by me
Don't sell me down the river or put me out in misery
Do right by me, do right by me

I knew I had to get away so I left that one horse town
Ain't much for a girl to do except get knocked up and settle down
The only dream some people have is to win the lottery
If you don't do right by yourself, do right by me

Some people climb a ladder till the end up at the bottom
Spending up all their precious time on money, fame, and stardom
All I ever wanted is my own song to sing
If you don't do right by yourself, do right by me
Do right by me

Do right by me
Don't sell me down the river or put me out in misery
Do right by me
For all that means
Do right by me
Do right
