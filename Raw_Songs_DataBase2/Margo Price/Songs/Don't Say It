Don't call the preacher when your car won't start
Don't call the doctor with a broken heart
Don't count your money til it hits the bank
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't pull the shades when the lights burn down
Don't shake the cage and let the tigers out
Don't clear your throat when you've got nothing to say
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't say you love me then act like you're above me
It's funny how you can be with someone and still feel lonely

Don't blame mee for what you did to yourself
Don't fall in love if you're in it for your health
If you drink all night you'll be thirsty all day
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

No, don't say you love me then act like you're above me
It's funny how you can be with someone and still feel lonely

I've been wondering what the hell's going on
Who gave you the right to do me so wrong
I don't care about your rules cause I don't want to play
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way

Don't count your money til it hits the bank
Don't clear your throat when you've got nothing to say
If you drink all night you'll be thirsty all day
Don't say you love me when you treat me this way
No, don't say you love me when you treat me this way
