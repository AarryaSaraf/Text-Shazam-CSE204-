I grew where I was planted
But I never felt at home
My head was filled with questions
And my feet, they long to roam
My arms reached out like branches
But my heart just couldn't stay
I left the moment that I could, a prisoner of the highway

I passed by farms and trailers
As I drove through little towns
I found trouble in the city
I never set my suitcase down
And in those empty alleys
Where retaining walls decay
I just kept a-moving as a prisoner of the highway

Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends

Well, the wind, it felt like freedom
As it whipped through my hair
I was everywhere and everyone
I was nobody and nowhere
Oh, the map was written on my hand and in my DNA
I believe that I was meant to be a prisoner of the highway

Had chains around my ankles
Handcuffs on my wrists
I was haunted by decisions
And simple things I missed
Dear God, why do I wander?
Was I born this way?
And I prayed he would release me as a prisoner of the highway

Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends

I sacrificed my family
Sacrificed true love
I sacrificed my unborn child to the heavens up above
Oh, there was not a limit
To those I would betray
Oh, I was deep down in it as a prisoner of the highway
I just kept a-moving as a prisoner of the highway (Highway, ooh)
