Elvis sang Willie Nelson
On the day that he died
"Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"
With the pain inside
He took his pills and he went to bed
Heart attack's what the paper said
But what I'd give just one more time to hear him sing

But the King is dead (Ooh-ooh)
He's long gone (Ooh-ooh)
Long live the King (Ooh)

MLK was a Christian
He loved Ghandi, he loved girls
Grew up in segregation
But he saw another world
He marched and sang and stood for the poor
He was for the fight, but against the war
But they murdered him like Christ 'cause he had a dream

But the King is dead (The King is dead)
He's long gone (Long gone)
Long live the King

They gunned down John Lennon
On a cold winter night (Ooh-ohh)
Outside of the Dakota
In the middle of his prime
They put him down for speaking the truth
He was a feminist and an asshole too
But in the end, he risked it all for love and peace, yeah

King is dead (The King is dead)
He's long gone (Long gone)
Long live the King
Long live the King
