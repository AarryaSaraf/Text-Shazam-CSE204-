Since you put me down
I've been drinking just to drown
I've been lying through the cracks in my teeth
I've been waltzing with my sin
He's an ugly evil twin
He's a double-crossing, back-stabbing thief

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a fifth of Evan Williams
When I found out you were never coming home
I killed the angel on my shoulder
When you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

No darling, I won't speak your name
And I hope that you will do the same
But I hope my voice will haunt you above the ground
If I see your face again don't consider me a friend
You made me feel like an orphan and act like a clown

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a handle of tequila
So I wouldn't have to spend my nights alone, all alone
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

And all the vampires at the bar
They won't ever get too far
They're just sucking all of the good blood out of this town
But I'm an outcast, and I'm a stray
And I plan to stay that way
And even if I fall from my grace I'm gonna land back on the ground

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a bottle of the Bulleit
So I wouldn't have to hear him bitch and moan, moan, moan
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone
