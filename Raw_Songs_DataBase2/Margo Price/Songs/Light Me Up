I can tell your mind is changing
From the worry in your eye
Lord knows you've been trying
While your life goes speeding by
Empty bottles full of time
Green and blue just like your worried eyes

I wake up and reach for you
In the middle of the night
Paranoid by cryptic dreams
That left me so uptight
If the world turns out your light
Honey it will always be alright
Right
Be alright
Alright

Light me up burn me up
Boil from the inside
Deeper than the ocean
Get me higher than the tide
Take me down shake the ground
Make the world explode
Rivers quake levees break
Make the wind blow

Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow
Take it slow

Words are just a shadow of a figure that we speak
Spoken like an echo we're so willing to repeat
Let your voice be silent I just want to see you come
Seeing me on the fortnight when the day is done
I went to sleep on a bed of nails and I woke up in chains
I'm sad when the sun is out but I'm happy when it rains

Light me up burn me up
Boil from the inside
Deeper than the ocean
Get me higher than the tide

Take me down shake the ground
Make the world explode
Rivers quake levees break
Make the wind blow

Tell me things I don't know
