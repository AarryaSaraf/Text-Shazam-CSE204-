Feelin' better now that we're through
Feelin' better cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I can see how you really are

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
How would I blame him if he said to me

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm turnin' you down, baby, and I'm goin' my way
Forget about you, baby, 'cause I'm leavin' to stay

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
No, no, no
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
No, no, you're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good, baby (You're no good)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
