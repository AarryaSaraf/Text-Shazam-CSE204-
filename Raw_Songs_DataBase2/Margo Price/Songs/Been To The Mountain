I got nothing to prove, I got nothing to sell
I'm not buying what you've got, I ain't ringing no bells
I got a mint in my pocket, got a bullet in my teeth
I'm going straight in the fire, I'm gonna talk to the high priest
Used to be a lover, queen and a drifter
A cowboy devil, a bride in a box, and
A pilgrim and a thief, but it was me underneath
I just know who I'm not and that's alright with me
Alright, alright

Can't tell me nothing babe, and that's a fact
I have been to the mountain and back, oh yeah

Well, I wish I was God, but I'm glad that I'm not
'Cause I think too much, got my head in a knot
The world's on fire, better save your brother
I've been a child and I've been a mother
I've been a victim and I've been a tumor
Used to be your waitress but now I'm a consumer
I've been on food stamps, I've been outta my mind
I rolled in dirty dollars, stood in the welfare line

I've been a number, I've been under attack
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright

I've been a dancer, a saint, an assassin
I've been a nobody, a truck-driver shaman
So many seasons that I've been adrift
Sometimes I've wondered if I even exist

Do you ever walk down the street and do you think to yourself
Am I being watched, man? Am I on the list? Well
I been called every name in the book, honey, go on, take your best shot
Take your best shot, take your best shot, and I got my back to the gun you
Aim at my heart, go on, take your best shot, now
I am the hunter and I am the hunted
I am a baby, I'm wanted
I'm an alchemist, teacher, I'm a sinner, I'm a preacher
And I know that there's more here than this
As I stare in the void of the black mountain vacuum
I know the scent of death like a perfume, no, this ain't the end
This ain't the end, this ain't the end, this ain't the end
Ooh, take off your tired eyes, undress your goodbyes 'cause
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright

Can't tell me nothing babe, and that's a fact
I have been to the mountain and back
Alright, alright
Alright
