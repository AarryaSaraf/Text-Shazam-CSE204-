Well, I'm leaving in the morning by the pink and the blue
Rubbing my eyes 'til a picture comes through
Of the great evacuation on all of the screens
But it's better than nothing, at least

Well, the scholars are rambling and the searchers are lost
They hung all their sins on the wrong kind of cross
The highway's abandoned, the brick man's deceased
But it's better than nothing, at least

I'm revving my engine, I laid my own tracks
But the farther you drive, well, it's hard to get back
You can't be cured without sickness, blessed by the priest
But it's better than nothing, at least

Well, I'm out on the fringes, but I guess it's my fault
The wheels of my sanity have come to a halt
Is it better to go crazy, forsake the masterpiece?
Well, it's better than nothing, at least

The saviors and the sinners and the mystics won't talk
They shoved all their secrets in a bulletproof box
Sometimes, being human feels like a disease
But it's better than nothing, at least

Sometimes, being human feels like a disease
But it's better than nothing, at least
