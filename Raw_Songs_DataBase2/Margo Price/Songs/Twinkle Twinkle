Way back in the good old days
Things weren't really all that good
We grew up with the TV on
We learned how from Hollywood
We learned how from Hollywood

Riding with my headphones on
In the back of my mama's car
Winding down that dirty road
Town was close but it felt far
Town was close but it felt far

Drive-in movies, Coca-Cola
Sweet 16, that kiss of death
Don't you cry when you should laugh
I smell liquor on your breath
I smell liquor on your breath

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch

Riding with my headphones on
In the back of my mama's car
Winding down that dirty road
Town was close but it felt far
Town was close but it felt far

Gettin by, gettin high
Feeling like a low life bum
Racked up debt, couldn't pay my rent
Pissin off til kingdom come
Pissin off til kingdom come

Mother Mary, geez Louise
I was havin a ball until I threw it too far
Playin dives, tryin to stay alive
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
It's a bitch

But then I won the lottery
I stuck gold and they picked me
Winner winner, chicken dinner
Hello mama look at me
Hello mama look at me

Now everything's turned inside out
They wanna put me on a big TV
Everybody wants to know
How I feel and what I think
How I feel and what I think

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
Don't you know it's a bitch?
It's a bitch
