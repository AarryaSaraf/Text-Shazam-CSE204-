I wrote Revelations on a crumbled up napkin
In an all-night diner by the roadway side
Waiter he was an angel kept filling up my coffee
And we made good conversation while I waited for my ride

Last night I played for a sold-out crowd down in Houston
Then we drove out to the ocean playing in the sand
These dark sunglasses I'm wearing this morning
Can't cover up my headache or the scars on my hands

Been healing the sick, blessing the poor
My feet are so tired and bruised
Hallelujah, what's it to you
Can't you see I need saving too?

My home life was unstable and it ain't much better now
I ain't no rotten apple but I ain't no sacred cow
Some people call you a genius some are saying not
Some folks only want you based on what you got

If you crucify glorify
They'll try to put a crown on you
Hallelujah, what's it to you
Can't you see I need saving too?

I never walked on water or turned it into wine
People make these stories up for something to believe
Now I'm living in a motel down on Highway 29
Nothing in my pockets and nothing up my sleeve

And if I never die this book that I write
I don't know who I'll send it to
Hallelujah, what's it to you?
Can't you see I need saving too
Hallelujah, what's it to you?
Can't you see I need saving too
