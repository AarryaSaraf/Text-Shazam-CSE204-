Why are we here, no one knows
Killin' and lovin' and wearin' clothes
Talkin' and yellin' and tradin' blows
And walkin' around like fools

Who am I, I'm like you
Who are you, you are what you do
Do me wrong and you're wrong too
And that's the Golden Rule

Ain't it just like love
To double cross you again
Get right under your skin
Do you in

Money and war, it's insane
Acting like the devil with God's name
But us and them, we're both the same
And we're all left to suffer

So dust to dust and bread to bread
Sin and pain and loneliness
Life is real and so is death
And we're all born blood brothers

Ain't it just like love
To double cross you again
Get right under your skin
Do you in
