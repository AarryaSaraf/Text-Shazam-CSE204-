Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

Can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
Can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
Can't play music if you ain't know what to play

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

John T. Floores was working for the Ku Klux Klan
Six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

All right Margo!
