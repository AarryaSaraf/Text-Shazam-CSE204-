Baby, when I'm gone
You know I think about you
You're growing up so fast
And I'm gettin' older too
And I've made mistakes
Yeah, I'm living proof of that
All the wasted days
Can't ever get 'em back

Check my bags, board again
It's a lonely flight from where I've been

Can't turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
And I've been doubting it these days
The river, it runs
Only one way
And when it's gone (When it's gone)
It's gone to stay

Baby, when I'm gone
You're learnin' how to live
Remember not to take so much
So you have something left to give
Just think of me in the love that I leave behind
Let it grow around you
Like a tie that binds

Half disconnected on the phone
I face the crowd, but I sleep alone

Can't turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
And I've been doubting it these days
The river, it runs
Only one way
When it's gone (When it's gone)
It's gone to stay
