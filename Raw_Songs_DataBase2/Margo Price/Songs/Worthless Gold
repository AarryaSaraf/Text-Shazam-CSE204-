Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

When I was a child saw the good in every man
I didn't know there was blood on every hand
But I labored in my time and the truth be told
I sold my soul for worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

Tried to walk that holy path but I strayed right from the start
Hanging out with all the angels heaven in the dark
I wrote those tunes and the bones down in the hole
But the only thing I stole was worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

Now the way I battled with all the demons in my mind
Caught between good and evil, Lord it almost made me blind
Thought it was something tangible something I could hold
Now that I know all that I know
Is that I'd trade all this worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
