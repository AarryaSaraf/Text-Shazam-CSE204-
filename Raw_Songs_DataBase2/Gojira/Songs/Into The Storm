Go!

Say something about awakening
The rebellion you felt before
Wake, change your course, laws will follow
Restart, reactivate the core

Rise!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Strength!
Gather your strength, raise your eyes
Fear not the demons you're up against

Now that you dove down
Found the bottom, begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Flames!
Dancing in the open
You step into the light
You step into the light

Now that you dove down
Found the bottom, begging for air
How sad, how long it takes us to rise and fight!
Yeah you come out, you're awake now
Put your fist in the air
You were hiding, now you throw yourself into the storm

Storm!
Into the storm
Storm!
