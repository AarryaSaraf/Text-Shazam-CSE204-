There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love
You saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's counting on

There's nothing left for you
