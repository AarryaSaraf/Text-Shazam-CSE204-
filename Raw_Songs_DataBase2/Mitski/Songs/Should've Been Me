Well I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'm sorry it should've been me
