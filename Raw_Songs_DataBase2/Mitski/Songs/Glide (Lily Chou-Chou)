I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony
