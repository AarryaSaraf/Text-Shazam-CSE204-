I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me?

Why didn't you stop me
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember

Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over
