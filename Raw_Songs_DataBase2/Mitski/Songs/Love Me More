If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl

I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me here

Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up?
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to

Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
