Everyone, all of them
Everyone said don't go that way
So, of course, to that I said
I think I'll go that way

And I left the door open to the dark
I said come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again
