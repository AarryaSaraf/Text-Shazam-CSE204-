No one on the highways tonight
Just you and me and the rigs we ride
Burnin' rubber wherever we go
Looking back at the orange glow

Each tunnel we take, my heart on the breaks
The road doesn't matter, it's how you haul
We lost in '99 after all
You put up the cards just to watch 'em fall

You always said you'd drive me
You always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, crazy

Eighteen wheels and two headlights in the night
Just look straight ahead if you like it slow
Take guesses on exits, one has to be right
November Rain's on the radio
Tall tales we make up, our eyes on the road
Nothing lasts forever, that's how it goes
Never thought I'd learn to love the snow
Breaker-breaker, break hearts, 10-4, Daddy-O

You always said you'd drive me
You always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, uh

You shift on the gear, it's been a long year
We're droppin' the hammer, got places to be
No time for the past if you're speedin' by me
Breaker-breaker, you there? Keep me company

You always said you'd drive me
Always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, crazy

Hey ya, breaker, saw you pass me earlier in the double and, uh
Caught a glimpse of you looking in the mirror
Just thought maybe you saw me as well and you could 10-22 in the rubber
Your lights are pretty faint now, red, like red eyes in the distance
Those double lanes only come around so often
