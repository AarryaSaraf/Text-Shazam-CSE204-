Pack your bags, baby
Polish up, ride out
You gotta bolt when you see the gates are down

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child running something on the wire

Flash of fire, feel the afterglow
Hit the ground and who's laughing now?
Forget about the score, yeah, who cares anymore?

Bad news buddy, every dog does get its day
Yeah, I know
Catch the sun, boy, let 'em say your name

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child running something down the wire

Sick of waiting for the hole to mend
Play it out like it's all pretend
Passing up a fight, you're gonna lose in the end

And ooh see the cowboy sing, yeah
And ooh it's just another scene
And ooh you've gotta live with what you said
Circling the drain
Wondering if the pain is the same

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child, running something down the wire

Come on in hot, babe
Hurry up, babe
Can't you see the gate from here?
And nothing holds me back at all
Nothing left to fear
Best of luck, my dear
Bucking side to side
Bronco running wild
