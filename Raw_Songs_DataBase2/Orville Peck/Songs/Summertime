Catch 'em by surprise and
Chasing the horizon
Nothing holds me down
Asking where the time's gone
Dreaming with the lights on
Trying to keep your eyes on
Something along the rise

You and I bide our time
And I miss summertime

Catch 'em on the run, they
Punish those who love young
Never right on time
Watch each other falling
Always catch the call and
Whistle while we're walking
Something inside me dies

You and I, why, oh, why
And I miss summertime

Keep on rocking, baby
Keep on rising on the tide
(Somewhere along the rise)
Son of a gun and maybe
We'll be riding all night
(Something inside me dies)
You and I (You and I)
You and I by and by
And I, I miss summertime

You and I (You and I)
Yeah, you and I, why, oh, why
And I, I miss summertime
