Red sky at morning, I still think of calling
You met me alone in the city
A fisherman's son, my dad liked to run
Can't picture your face, but I know it was pretty
Yeah, you drew me that night
I saw love in your eyes but I didn't know how to begin
When I walked you to mine, promised we'd take our time
Baby, some of us we ain't meant to win

Saddle up and ride on down
Maybe when the tide comes out
Come and find me
Waiting on the street where we met
Haven't found the time to forget
Funny what we lose, yeah when we bet
Hey!

Red sky at night, I was holding too tight
You left me alone by the Thames
Under waterloo's shine, had a dream we were fine
Maybe somehow we were, in between
Still there's something 'bout men that I don't understand
They're always leaving wherever they've been
Brush it off with a shrug, I don't know much about love
Still I give it a try now and then

Saddle up and ride on down
Maybe when the tide comes out
Come and find me
Waiting on the street where we met
Haven't found the time to forget
Funny what we lose, yeah when we bet

Red skies all gone, I guess it's been long
I haven't gone back that much to your city
Still nothing compares to the night we were there
It's okay, I don't want any pity
Yeah, but spare me a thought if you got any heart
I know you had one deep inside
I don't miss you that much but, baby, watching you blush
Some of us, we just gotta ride
Some of us, we gotta saddle up and ride, saddle up and ride
Yeah, saddle up and ride
Saddle up and, and ride
Ooh
Saddle up and ride
