Mulholland's gold and you're awake, babe
The season's grey
You drive real fast and I can tell that it's just not your lucky day
Or so they say
Boulevard boy, give me nothing, you're the one I chose
And so it goes

Baby
The light stays longer when it rains, babe
Ain't that a shame?
Take me out to the race, toast our mistakes

And I hate to say
I spent it all on masquerades
Oh and I, I'd forgotten how it goes
Flash a smile while the traffic's slow
Take a seat while I trample out the days

Baby
Your eyes grow cold into the night, babe
You start to fade
You had your reasons, but I'm telling you that seasons always change
Hold it up to the day, wish it all away

And I hate to say
I spent it all on masquerades
Oh and I
Watch me waving as I go
Bury my heart at the rodeo
Take a seat while I trample out the days
