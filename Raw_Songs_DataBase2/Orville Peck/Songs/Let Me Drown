Been finding it hard to be kind
Since I've been lost out there, losing my mind
And I still keep on searching for what I can't find
Let me drown

Don't wanna wash you away
I swear there's good things that are coming your way
And I can't be the one left here dragging you down
Let me drown

Only one knew my name
Nothing left but the summer rain
Drag me 'round 'til I never complain
Let me drown

And then suddenly we're writing out the same old lie
When water is all around
Baby, I can be the one you drown tonight
Well, I had sun in my eyes and I'd confide
We're no worse off than the worst of 'em, it's fine

Never knew where was home
I slept a lifetime alone
Yeah, we had it one time but it's gone now, it's gone
Let me drown

I know with pleasure comes pain
I figured we were the same
But as I get older I get more afraid
Let me drown

So, no I can't be kind since I lost my mind
And this town just ain't big enough for the both of us now
Let me drown
No, I can't be kind since I lost my mind
And this town just ain't big enough for the both of us now
Let me drown
