Oh, I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Met a man in Denver, bottleneck and some old blue jeans
Tells me we got something special now
I say some things ain't what they seem
Run off with the sunrise, Reno never felt so slow
A Wednesday child with a rented ride and a head that's full of woe

And I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Drag me to the party, guess I got nowhere to go
Got a man to my left and one on my right
And they're telling me 'bout what they know
Headed for the back, I meet a girl who's tryna shoot the breeze
She tells me she don't like Elvis
I say I want a little less conversation please

And I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Yeah, let's go

Baby, I'm outta time
