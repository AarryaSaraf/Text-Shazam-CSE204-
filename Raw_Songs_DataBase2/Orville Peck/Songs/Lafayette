Hurry over and cry, Lafayette
I knew that I'd lose you the moment we met
But the bayou still sings every night in my head
Though I can't understand what it wants
I love when it rains but I hate getting wet
Never thought it'd be me that you'd haunt

Can't remember your words, Lafayette
You said, "Words didn't matter, it's what's in your head"
But if you don't ask then you're bound not to get
Still know what you said wasn't wrong
I can't turn a corner or walk down the street
Without seeing your face come along

Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, "There ain't no cowboys left"
But they ain't met me and they ain't met you, Lafayette
They ain't met me, Lafayette
Ooh
They ain't met you, Lafayette

The months march away, Lafayette
I hear it takes years for the heart to reset
Yeah, but one of these days, I'll be done with regret
Didn't think it would take me this long
Still sing Delta Dawn when I catch a sunset
I remember how you loved that song

Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, "There ain't no cowboys left"
But they ain't met me and they ain't met you, Lafayette
