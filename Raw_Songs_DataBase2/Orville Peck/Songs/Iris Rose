Bez Valley never saw the day
I would've wanted you to watch me play
But I hear the songs there are better
Thinking back to those Southern nights
Give it all to hear you call me, "Guy"
But I know that's why we don't say never
And I wish you'd stayed
Maybe I'd be the same
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose
Let's go

Get along darlin', sweet goodbye
Sit alone, together, watch the sky
You tell me not to cry so I just sigh
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose

Think about you nearly every day
Dream a lot and it starts to sting
But I hear the wild winds are clever
Red sand keeps you waiting now
Sing it loud so you don't have to shout

And I'll say, "I wish you'd stayed"
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose
Iris Rose, Iris Rose
Iris Rose, Iris Rose
