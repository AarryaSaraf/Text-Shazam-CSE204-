Sun comes up over the plains
Lay in bed, sleep the day away
Think of all the things we used to see
All those pictures of you and me
And I, I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

Warm nights wane, we hear the trees a-hummin'
Softly you whisper, you hope it ain't gone
Sit in bars, sit on sidewalks, sit down and just cry where you're standing
I sit alone anyway, every night in your arms
And now I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore

For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

Count the lights, think of what we had
Baby, I'm headed back west
Go ahead, be beside yourself
Drive 'til we got nothing left
Hold my breath 'cause I'm scared to death
We didn't know it 'til now
I hate springtime anyhow

For now, yeah, for now
All I can say, all I can say
All I can say, all I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
All I can say, all I can say
All I can say, all I can say is goodbye
