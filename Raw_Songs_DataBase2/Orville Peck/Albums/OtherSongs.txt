// Born This Way (The Country Road Version) //

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothin' wrong in lovin' who you are", she said
"'Cause he made you perfect, babe
So hold your head up and you'll go far"
Listen to me when I say

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

If I wanna make it country
Baby, it's okay
I was born, I was born
I was born this way
From London, Paris, Japan, back to USA
I was born on the road
I was born to be brave

No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Asian or Latinx made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

I was born this way
I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

// Smalltown Boy //

To your soul
To your soul
Cry
Cry
Cry

You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand why you had to leave
But the answers you seek will never be found at home
The love that you need will never be found at home

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away

Pushed around and kicked around, always a lonely boy
You were the one that they'd talk about around town as they put you down

And as hard as they would try they'd hurt to make you cry
You never cried to them, just to your soul
No, you never cried to them, just to your soul

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away (Crying to your soul)

Cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry
Cry, boy, cry, boy, cry

You leave in the morning with everything you own in a little black case
Alone on a platform, the wind and the rain on a sad and lonely face

Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
Run away, turn away, run away, turn away, run away
