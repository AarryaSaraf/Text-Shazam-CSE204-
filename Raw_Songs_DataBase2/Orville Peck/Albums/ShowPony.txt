// Summertime //

Catch 'em by surprise and
Chasing the horizon
Nothing holds me down
Asking where the time's gone
Dreaming with the lights on
Trying to keep your eyes on
Something along the rise

You and I bide our time
And I miss summertime

Catch 'em on the run, they
Punish those who love young
Never right on time
Watch each other falling
Always catch the call and
Whistle while we're walking
Something inside me dies

You and I, why, oh, why
And I miss summertime

Keep on rocking, baby
Keep on rising on the tide
(Somewhere along the rise)
Son of a gun and maybe
We'll be riding all night
(Something inside me dies)
You and I (You and I)
You and I by and by
And I, I miss summertime

You and I (You and I)
Yeah, you and I, why, oh, why
And I, I miss summertime

// No Glory In The West //

They say Paris is dead
Lived through London and drank through Memphis
The things you live by were once just a guess
And there ain't no glory in the west
No there ain't no glory in the west
Hard to think on your feet
Tired of begging them just to compete
Shoot to win can feel so bittersweet
But you take what you can get
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
Blazin' on ahead, burning through it
Coming down the bend, nowhere left to go, goin's all we know
Ridin' past the best, and there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
There ain't no glory in the west

What's a boy to do?
Hit the road with a dollar or two
Haunted by what he knows he can't do
Gets it off his chest
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
Burnin' on ahead, blazing through it
Running blind again, nowhere left to go, goin's all we know
Ridin' past the best, and there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
There ain't no glory in the west

Count your blessings they'll say
And after each midnight begins a new day
But don't place your bets on a word that they say
They'll put your life to rest
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
No there ain't no glory in the west
There ain't no glory in the west

// Drive Me, Crazy //

No one on the highways tonight
Just you and me and the rigs we ride
Burnin' rubber wherever we go
Looking back at the orange glow

Each tunnel we take, my heart on the breaks
The road doesn't matter, it's how you haul
We lost in '99 after all
You put up the cards just to watch 'em fall

You always said you'd drive me
You always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, crazy

Eighteen wheels and two headlights in the night
Just look straight ahead if you like it slow
Take guesses on exits, one has to be right
November Rain's on the radio
Tall tales we make up, our eyes on the road
Nothing lasts forever, that's how it goes
Never thought I'd learn to love the snow
Breaker-breaker, break hearts, 10-4, Daddy-O

You always said you'd drive me
You always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, uh

You shift on the gear, it's been a long year
We're droppin' the hammer, got places to be
No time for the past if you're speedin' by me
Breaker-breaker, you there? Keep me company

You always said you'd drive me
Always said you'd drive me, crazy
Said it was you and me till we died
So hands on the wheel and let's drive
Buckle up and drive me, crazy

Hey ya, breaker, saw you pass me earlier in the double and, uh
Caught a glimpse of you looking in the mirror
Just thought maybe you saw me as well and you could 10-22 in the rubber
Your lights are pretty faint now, red, like red eyes in the distance
Those double lanes only come around so often

// Kids //

Never really felt this world
Haystack boy and dust-cake girl
But I, I know we never tried
Passing the days away
Dare me on a dime to say
That we had everything we need

Running out into the night
Starry boots and open eyes, yeah
You told me to shut my mouth and to my surprise
Neither one of us has died

Washed up, nowhere to go
Hate to say, "I told you so", but I
I'm just a nervous guy
Target on our backs each day
Tables turn, or so they say
But we, we know that nothing's free

Running out into the night
Getting low on luck, it's time to fight, yeah
You call me up and tell me all your frights
'Cause neither one of us has died

Running out into the night
Watch the girls, they're outta sight, yeah
I keep thinking we'll disappear but years go by
Still neither one of us has died

// Legends Never Die //

Been gone, back from my old ways
Too long, draggin' these doggone days
But each song keeps me rolling along my way
And I pray

I've seen people tuggin' on the reins
Full speed, baby, dust is in my veins
A stampede couldn't break me in my stride
You wanna know why?

It gets lonesome on the lonesome trail, so keep your head up high

Because, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked it every mile
Takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
I've been rode hard and put up wet
Ain't nothing in this world that I can't get
Don't worry 'bout making sure they won't forget
No, it's fine 'cause legends never die

Wild heart, got some hazy memories
Bad start, yeah, when you keep bad company
Won't stop 'cause I never lost a fight
Well once or twice

I said, let's go, baby, I got nerves of steel
It's my show, gonna feel the way I feel
Another blow ain't gonna stop me
Wait and see

You got nothing if you ain't got pride so honey take the wheel

I said, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked it every mile
Yeah, takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
Well I been rode hard and put up wet
Ain't nothing in this world that I can't get
Yeah, don't you worry 'bout making sure they won't forget
No, it's fine 'cause legends never die

Baby, baby, you got one chance
Legends never die

Because, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked every mile
Yeah, well takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
Baby, baby, you get one chance, when you strike the match
Ain't nothing in this life gonna hold me back
Sometimes you gotta break away from the pack but it's fine
'Cause legends never die

Legends never die
They won't die, they won't die
Never die

Yeah
Legends never die
Baby, baby
You tell 'em
Baby, never die

// Fancy //

I remember it all very well looking back
Was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, worn-out shack on the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent, to say the least we was hard-pressed
And mama spent every last penny we had to buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair and she painted my eyes and lips
Stepped into a satin dancin' dress that had a slit in the side clean up to my hips
It was red velvet trimming and it fit me good
Staring back from the looking glass, there stood a woman where a half-grown boy had stood

Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down

Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she kissed my cheek
I could see the tears welling up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack, and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said, "To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across the toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking, asking, "Mama what do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentleman, Fancy, they'll be nice to you"

Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, well, it's up to you
Don't let me down now, your mama's gonna move you uptown

That was the last time I saw my Ma, the night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby, mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn and for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long till I knew exactly what my mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
Said I was gonna be a lady someday, though it didn't matter when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life with my head held down in shame
You know, I might've been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name

Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down

It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the street
One week later I was pouring his tea in a five-room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman, and the occasional aristocrat
I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat and I ain't done bad
Now in this life there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
And criticize mama for turning me out, no matter how little we had
And though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for now on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor mama's voice ringing in my ears

Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, well, it's up to you
Don't let me down now, your mama's gonna move you Uptown
