Maybe you
Could lift me out the struggle that I fell into
With all the crazy things that you put me through
I just need a way to keep pushin' Gotta keep pushin'

And I'll take you on if you give me the time
And then all at once
So I'ma say, "Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

And I'll take you on if you give me the time
And then all at once
So I'ma say, "Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Drug dealer
Somebody that gon' heal her
Make her change her ways, like nobody would believe her

She want a drug dealer
Somebody that gon' heal her
Make her change her ways, like nobody would believe her

I need you by my side every day, every night
If your love is true then just prove that it's right
No matter what you do, I need you in my life
Baby, let's do it right
Baby, let's do it right

And I'll take you on if you give me the time
And then all at once
So I'ma say, "Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

And I'll take you on if you give me the time
And then all at once
So I'ma say, "Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Open up your heart and I'll give into you
Until you recognize that I'm into you, into you

You say that you love it when I try to make you stay
All that I've been savin' for you when I'm back again
But maybe I'm fallin' under pressure, baby
Just tell me I shouldn't wanna go anywhere, ooh, ooh

Who's gonna find out?
(Ooh, just tonight, ooh, just tonight, oh)
If we run away

And I'll take you on if you give me the time
And then all at once
So I'ma say, "Goodbye"
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

And I'll take you on
And then all at once
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Open up your heart and I'll give into you
Until you recognize that I'm into you, into you

And open up your heart and I'll give into you
Until you recognize that I'm into you, into you

Maybe you, could lift me out the struggle that I fell into
With all the crazy things that you put me through
I just need a way to keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin'

And I'll take you on
And then all at once

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

And I'll take you on
If you give me the time
Then all at once
Don't wanna say goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
