Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are? Do you know everything?
Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are? Do you know everything?
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all, all
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
A mismatched friend, but LA's good to me
Place I call my home, that's history

I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you

I want you, don't you hear me?
I want you, through the clouds and the smoke
I want you
Nights like these don't happen anymore
Especially ones that last 'til the morn'
How can I keep you on the floor?

Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar

I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
