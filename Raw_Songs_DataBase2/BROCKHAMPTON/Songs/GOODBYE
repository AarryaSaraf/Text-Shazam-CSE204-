Was always the loser, you thought it was cool
What's the move? What's the move?
Love me or leave me, I never could choose
Thanks to you, thanks to you
It's over
I'm out, yeah
At your gravestone

Open the closet, welcome to dark side
Drunk driving, DUIs
Sneakin' my sips just like you taught me
Responsible degradation
Love us, lost love
I try, oh

You're the only one I risk my life for
What a surprise to see you tonight
Everybody's been working all week
Ready to release it all
You're the only one I'm glad to see here
Friday fresh from a late-night shift
This oughta be the best time
The best time of our lives

Goodbye horses
I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses
I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses (Days)
I'm flying over you
Goodbye horses
I'm flying, flying, flying over you
