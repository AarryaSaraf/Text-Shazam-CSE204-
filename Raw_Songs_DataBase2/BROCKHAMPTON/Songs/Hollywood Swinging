Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
I said, "Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?" (Yeah)
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging (That's nice)
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging (Hollywood swinging)

When I'm walking down the street
Move my hips and my feet (Don't talk to me when I'm dancing)
I wanna say hey (Give me my crown)
I don't have the time (Give me my crown)

I said, "Hey, hey, hey
What you got to say?"
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging (That's nice)
Hollywood, Hollywood swinging

Came a real long way to make it here
Ain't a thing you could do to change it here
It's a party on the moon, the gang is here
No games are here, we reigning here
Ten toes on the roof, we hanging there
It's a treasure you could never take in there
Yeah a whole new feeling we chasing here
No games are here, we reigning here

(Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)
(Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging)

Where is my crown?
Give me my crown!
This is my town
You're in my town
