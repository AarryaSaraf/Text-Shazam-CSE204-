Back when we was still outside (Yeah)
Church next door, we couldn't afford a tie
I was only nineteen, I was down for the ride (Woo)
Everything I wanted on my passenger side (Yeah)
Embraced who we was, we was broke, we was live
We would smoke, we was high
We would smile just to vibe (Yeah)
Fightin' to survive, just to get ideas out (Come on)
When niggas was hungry, couldn't afford the big house (Come on)
Niggas was scrawny, somebody break the ribs out
Fightin' over meals, the crib was not Aunt Viv's house
Man, press photo with the blue couch
Now we hate each other just to hang out (Come on)

Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that
Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that

It's all of us sittin' there in the living room
I'm like, "Fuck it, yo, this what we finna do
I can't stand seein' us not there
On the big screen with the homies here
We know once we get that shot
We gon' push limits and never look back" (Yeah, uh)

Fast forward, everything feels backwards
Everything went left at the BRIT Awards
When I decided not to show up or show support
'Cause I was tryna go solo before we went on tour (Come on)
Too much trauma for me to be at my highest (Come on)
I missed Ameer, so me and Dom kept fightin' (Mm)
He almost pushed me off the edge (Edge)
But honestly, I shouldn't've said what I said (Yeah)
I shoulda went to therapy instead
I started to heal, that's what we all needed
The record deal wasn't helpin' either (Come on)
That merch deal ain't help either, man (Come on)
It gave me more money for alcohol
I guess blowin' up ain't all that at all

Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that
Oh, oh, oh
(I know it ain't) All that
(I know it ain't) All that
