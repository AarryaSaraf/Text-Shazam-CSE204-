Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
Change your mind when I change my life, better start believing in myself
And we all now, looking for, looking for God, so we never see it in ourselves
Shit, divine intervention, move in stealth
It's hard to tell what do prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime on the graveyard got a nigga feelin' real
My instability's trademark, copywritten in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of living
Tear my temple down into a prison

Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
You slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
That lens zooming in, catching all my stripes
Used to trade a joint for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night
Forties suffice, I'm only alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm acting foolish
Could you pick me up around noonish?
Half a blunt, yeah we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Time to take a seat and yeah we cruisin'

And I love right, I love you right
All by yourself, but I make it right
Baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you
I want you

Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

So, do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me, ohh

Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, ohh
