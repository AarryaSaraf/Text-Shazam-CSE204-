Yeah, go sit out
Go through somethin', blind new, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the gals come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch standby, feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til you both feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't leave you now, now-now-now

Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keepin' it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playin' pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
And that's the downside (Downside) of keepin' it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playin' pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
That's the downside

For these couple racks, this fame or some new Chanel (Ayy)
Caught a whiff and now, ooh, got that new smell
Pushin' in that G-Wagen, I wonder how that coupe feel
How is you feel? Uh, grindin' too, still

Yeah, that's the downside (Downside) of keepin' it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playin' pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
That's the downside (Downside) of keepin' it in
That's the downside (Downside) of playin' pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
That's the downside

That's the downside
That's the downside
Shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hard
