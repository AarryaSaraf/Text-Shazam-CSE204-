That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh), ow, ow

Let me know what's happening, guess them niggas back again
This for all my prisoners, specifically my Africans
I pray to a rhythm, turn a venue to the Vatican
I'm in my fifth element inside this vintage acronym
How we do it like this? This the life that that shit baffling
I rip everything I touch like my last name was Hamilton
What you niggas standing in? That shit look like lanolin
You ain't doing nothing out here, just amount to mannequin
Someone call the ambulance, I'm damaging these beats, I get to tramplin'
Moments that we making everything these niggas sampling
Touch of child abandonment, my ancestors, I'm channeling
Breakin' through the paneling, this what my niggas ambled in

That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh), ow, ow

Got a thick ting, pull up in an Uber
Take care of me, wet like a scuba
She said, "Bari, you the future"
We popped a pill and then we took a flight straight off to Jupiter
We seen all kind of things, stars is aligning, man
She kissing all over me, I feel like a candy ring
On top, I feel like a king, bustin' it down the ranks
My baby, she love me to death, above where the heaven begins
Wake up in the morning and do it again

That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh)
