Hey

When I get back from the road
He just like me, front row
Love when they singing these songs
Venue turns into my home

Gas station, 2 AM
Yelling so loud with my kinfolk
My pants ain't Raf Simons
Yeah, these Dickies from Walmart
Tour bus smoked out
Don't let Jon find out
I'm waking up alone
HK's snore is still going
Throwing on my cologne
Hiding my hickeys that Nick was giving me
Trilogy popping, it's awesome
It's gon' take a second for y'all to get rid of me (Hey)

When I get back from the road
He's just like me, front row
Love when they singin' these songs
Venue turns into my home
When I get back from the road (Can I get? I'm back from the road)
He's just like me, front row (Front row)
Love when they singin' these songs (Oh, hate when they singin')
Venue turns into my home (Oh, turn when he sing)

Cribs in Carolina, Waffle House in Georgia
Sunset looks like make-believe, I'ma see my aunt in Florida
Screaming in the lobby, hotel wanna sue me
Ashlan keep the camera rollin', now our life's a movie
