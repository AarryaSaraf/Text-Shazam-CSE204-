Baby, I know nothin' on us is gone forever, all for power and respect
Needed somethin' for myself, now I need somethin' to protect
Ain't the one you wanna check 'less you committed to correct
I been good for one and I ain't even have it, you can check

Let me be the one you go to when you wanted to connect
Always more than meets the eye, love to hear you, can expect
Everybody swear they know you, got no clue, I really guessed, yeah

I ascend, gone with the wind again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Stargazin' the days, never take offense (No, no, no)
Thin skin turned thick, scar tissue, man
Be the bigger man, I'm the bigger man (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Big bag drew blood in self-defense (No, no, no)
Patched up, go up and down again
Time spent, don't bend like these rubber bands
Had to take a stand, I stay on the fence
I don't wanna throw hands, that was never my plan
I was tryna get right
You ain't have to do that, I might have to fall back
Gotta go and get mine

Nigga, goodbye, goodbye, to all those troubled nights
