Let me be the one that you cling to
Let me be the one that you call on
Let me be the one that you cling to (Let me be the one)
Let me be the one that you call on
You can mute it for me

Back when I had a 'fro still
First moved to L.A., my daddy still paid my phone bill
I was sneaking niggas out in the early morning
After sucking good dick on a Sunday morning
Walking through the living room, I see Jabari yawning
I'm thinking, "Man, one day we all gon' be some superstars"
And this is way back before I had a credit card
And this is way back when I ain't have a debit card
And this is way back when we all still prayed to God
When Clancy believed in me when fans wasn't singing songs
When Kelly would talk to me when I ain't have no friends at all
Besides them niggas that I lived with
This the most corrupted vision
I turned my friendship into a business into an empire
Half a million that I wired to my mama, she retired
Call Ameer, I'm getting tired of the drama

Getting tired of letting culture try to tell me how to live my life
How to live my life
How to live my life
This the ending we all envisioned, right?
This is me, Abstract gone for the night (For the night)
How you feel?
