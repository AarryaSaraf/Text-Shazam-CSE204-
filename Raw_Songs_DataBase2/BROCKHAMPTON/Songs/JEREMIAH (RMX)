Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Pull up on 44s
That'show it goes
I need the stars to help a nigga find his way back home
Dressed just like I'm ready to hit a lick on next door
Lick the chest and miss the rest
History do unfold
History lose control
Missin' me lost control
Out my way like bowling pin
Like ay ay ay ay
So pull up on 44s
Like that raging bull was askin' you
And if the money stay the same
Then I won't change my attitude

Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

See me out by the way
I'll be out late
Summertime in the back
Goin' sideways
Pack it up, stack it up
By the driveway
You do you all the time, I don't mind it

What I'm smokin' put a cow in a coma
Hot and black like Folgers
She got me up this mornin'
If your shorty your shorty, why she do my chores for me?
Heels over her head
Her soul ends up on the ceiling

Tommy she'll fit in my jeans
Don't need Balmain
Talkin' all you do is talkin'
Be honest

Oh my bitch
Makin' love then askin' for a hundred
College to Coachella
This workin' vacation
You got curls and time
You stack the party
It's the time we clock in
I was in the booth till 6 in the mornin'

Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lettin' my hair down
Lettin' it grow natural
Tell 'em I said nothin'
Tell 'em I sent Jeremiah
Weeping prophets, yeah, yeah
Me and my pockets, yeah, yeah
Deep inside it, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
