I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling

I ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana to Atlanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Pulled in by the sight of you up on the couch, so cosy
Know that you look like rosey cheeks
Or are you so cosy with somebody else?
Get nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'ma be ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late night corner, we pass
Flick that switch and get ready
Used to skip around the pain
We don't go there no more
We don't see sun no more

Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything from pots and pans to fans like GoldenEye
Everything 'cept the door
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect but it's never gettin' solved

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)

Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess
Never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it outta bed
Time-bomb under it
Persuading you to hop in

Mm, options, runnin' out of options
Mm, options, used to have options
Mm, options, runnin' out of options
Mm, options, used to have options

I don't know where I'm going
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling
I don't know where I'm going
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)

Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
The pressure put me in the places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth, they said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weaving our fate are getting harder to please
But I believe to an extreme (We all can find a way)
To anybody listening that's in between (We all can find a way)

Went to church for the hell of it
Stumbled in drunk as shit, been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wondering who I am
Been thinking I am better than him
In times like these I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

I wash it out of all of me to feel the fire
(Maybe I'll be gone for a minute and)
But you know, you know that's a lie
(No one helped me when my eyes go)
I wash it out of all of me to feel the fire
(Maybe I'll be gone for a minute and)
But you know, you know that's a lie
(No one helped me when my eyes go)

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
