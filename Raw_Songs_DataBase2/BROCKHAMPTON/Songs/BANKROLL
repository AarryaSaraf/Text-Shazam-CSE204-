Coo-coo
Yeah

Shit on your function
Live from the dungeon (Woop)
Don't know why you cuffin'
My dick she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this
Can't talk like this, woo
Safety pin on wrist
I put racks on my little bitch
Speakin' the truth, 2k a tooth, ooh
Maybach Jeep huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me but I am hater proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli in about a day or two
I am filled with lust
On a DM with Hype Williams, talkin' 'bout bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talkin' 'bout video treatments and such (Damn!)
But I'm busy loving on the IG Smut, damn, fuck
I'm a goat in a Lamb truck
Roll the video, pan up when you talk to me
Godzilla, trilla nigga, rip apart cities (Ooh-ooh)
Got niggas in the pocket of my varsity (Yeah!)

They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never short on that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walking with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Uh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Wan' take off my armor now
Can't afford not to splurge on her
Have to break down the Berlin Wall
Just to come talk to ya'
Who hurt ya'? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome with major plans
Know I'm hard, suck my consonants
Know I'm hard, suck my consonants
Make her run like a Boston bomb
I'm the one, yeah the one she wants
Wanna love me like Wimbledon
Raise the volume, ring alarm
Hands on my girl, it's a charm
Gotta passion, don't call her loud
Don't tell my shorty settle down
I wear her out like a hand me down
Don't say I'm too big for ya'
Make my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off
Your ex income minimum
Baby, run with some bigger Dons
Baby, run with some bigger Dons
I got da cash and it lasts 'cause I dash to the bag
My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like a light, ay

They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never short on that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walking with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Uh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Wanna be my main bitch? You gotta get the C.R.E.A.M.
To rollaround me in the Grenadines
Ya' gotta come through looking pristine
'Cause this bankroll is foreign
Ain't for no nab, that ain't going
Yeah, I'm getting money like I'm back in the east
Got me looking legit and they know it
And I'm counting it, ain't gotta show it off
See me in your spot, low key throwin' you off
If you talkin' 'bout cash in my ear like a kitty, you know that it's stayin' up
If you ain't on that move back, bro
Don't even talk to the gang, no
Walk around tilt with the bankroll
Keep putting stacks in the bankroll

You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Now catch the conversation)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Change the conversation)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Dollars, all I'm chasin')
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Fuck is you sayin'?)
