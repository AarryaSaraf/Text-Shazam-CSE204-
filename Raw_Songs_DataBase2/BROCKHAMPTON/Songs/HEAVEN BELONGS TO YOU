Immerse myself in discontent
Hoping you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger

What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze' sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me' now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me' but hey it wasn't me (Boo, boo, boo)
Like God can judge me' but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judging me
I walk on water, paint and touch' what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only see-see me when I'm doing burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen

Fuck God, I'ma dog backwards
Backwoods, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you saying? Why you praying for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you saying? Why you praying for forgiveness?
Whole lot of shit and some bitches, like
(Mhh, mhh, ha, yeah, fuck it, yeah, yeah)

Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
