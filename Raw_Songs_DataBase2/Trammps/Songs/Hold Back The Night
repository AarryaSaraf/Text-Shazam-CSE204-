Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby
(Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby

When you left you took the sun right out of the sky
(Oh yes, you did)
Wondered why you went away, never told me why
When the sun goes down and the moon is near
I'm scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't wanna dream about you, baby
(Dream about you, baby)
Hold back the night, turn on the lights

Loneliness is haunting me when I go to bed, honey
Like a character in a book, in a book that I read
When the sun goes down the moon is near
Scared to death 'cause your face appears

Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby

Hold back the night, turn on the lights
Don't want to dream about you, baby
