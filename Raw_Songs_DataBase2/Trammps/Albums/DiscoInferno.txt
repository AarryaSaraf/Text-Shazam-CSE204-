I am the party of the first heart, you are the party of the second
Whereas we propose to have fun, the fun has just begun

We just got to tune into each other
Can't be afraid to touch one another

You don't have to worry or speculate
You don't need a lawyer to negociate
Listen

I guarantee to satisfy
If there's a problem I'll indemnify

To have your body with me all night

To give you all the love you need

I just got to have you for myself
Yes I have
You can't deal with no one else
No you can't
I fulfill your womanly desires
I promise you it's more than you require, yes it will
You've got the option to be free
But if you sign it, it's exclusively

// I Feel Like I've Been Living (On The Dark Side Of The Moon) //

Each night I go to sleep
With nothing but your memory
Sweet thoughts come into view
All I see is your sweet body

Well, well, well, well yeah (sometimes I can, I can hear your breathin')
(Something in the night)
Seems so real to me
(But that's just my mind playing tricks on me)
But life alone is my destiny (shoopadoo)

Yeah (I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone
(It feels like I've been living)
No!
(On the dark side of the moon)
Well, yeah yeah!

Another thing I wanna say

If I, if I had known
Your life so far will be forever
I'd know, I'd change my ways
To keep you here
Till the last thin' ever, well

(Sometimes I can, I can see you walking)
I can see you walking
(Just ahead of me ahead of me)
Ahead of me
(But that's just my mind playing tricks on me)
But life alone is my destiny (shoopadoo)

Yeah (I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone
(It feels like I've been living)
No!
(On the dark side of the moon)
Oh, baby!

(I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone, no
(It feels like I've been living)
Sometimes I think
(On the dark side of the moon)
I can hear you breathin'
(I feel like I've been living)
But I know it's just my heart, yeah
(On the dark side of the moon)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
(It feels like I've been living)
I don't wanna live no, no
(On the dark side of the moon)

I wish to soul and heart (I feel like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon) you'll set me free
I don't want to live (it feels like I've been living)
I don't want to live I don't want to live alone
(On the dark side of the moon)
Feels like I'm on the dark side
Of the moon, yeah

Sometimes I feel
I can hear you breathin'
But I know, but I know, but I know
It's just a dream
Come on hon, oh
I don't wanna live alone, no
It's no fun being alone
I don't wanna live alone
I'm so tired of being alone, say it
I've been living
I don't wanna live

(It feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon)
...

(It feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone, no

(It feels like I've been living)
Sometimes I think
(On the dark side of the moon)
I can hear you breathin'
(It feels like I've been living)
But I know it's just my heart, yeah
(On the dark side of the moon)

Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby (it feels like I've been living)
I don't wanna live no no (on the dark side of the moon)

I wish to soul and heart (it feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon) you'll set me free
I don't want to live (it feels like I've been living)
I don't want to live I don't want to live alone
(On the dark side of the moon)

// Disco Inferno //

(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)
(Burn baby burn)

To my surprise one hundred storeys high
People getting loose y'all
Getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control
It was so entertaining
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
(Burnin)
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
That makes me know
There's a party somewhere

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough
So I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody is going strong
And that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down
(Burn baby burn) disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) burn that mother down

// You Touch My Hot Line //

I was a cold, cold man
Well, well, then you came along and made me understand
Oh, I had the real outlook on life
You took me out on the town
And you made it, oh, you made it work out right

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no

You touch my hot line when you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line, and now, and now, ow

Your warm and tender body in my arm
Well, yeah, the thrill and the chills of your charms, well
Oh, you spark the flame
That made this iceberg melt
You warm my body
Oh, you showed me, oh, you girl, you're something else

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no
You touch my hot line when you dance so fine
You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line, and now, and now
You touch my hot line

Oh, I had the real outlook on life
You took me out on the town
And you showed me, oh, you really got down

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no
You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
And now, and now, ow

You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (Ow, ow, ow)
You touch my hot line

Ooh, well, well, get on down (Hey, baby, girl, you dig)
Shake it (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
Love the way you move, hmm (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
Love the way you groove (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
You dance so fine, mmm (Baby)
You're mine, all mine (Said you're mine, all mine)
Oh, your warm, tender body (Tender body)
Turns me on, yes, it does
Turnin', turnin' me upside down
Oh

You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (You did it, baby)
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine (You did it, baby)
You touch my hot line, 'cause you're mine, all mine (You did it)

You touch my hot line when you really got down (Yes, you did)
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (The way you touch me, ah)

You touch my hot line
