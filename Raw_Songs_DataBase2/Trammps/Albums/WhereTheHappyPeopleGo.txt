Album: WhereTheHappyPeopleGo

// That's Where The Happy People Go //

I used to spend most of my time
Just being alone, yes, I did
Nothing to do, no place to go
Just stayed at home

So I put my blues upon the shelf
And I made up my mind
To live a little myself
So I went on down to a disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
(Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Now listen, all my friends
They wonder what's come over me
They all say I'm not the
Same old guy I used to be, yeah

First of all, I got myself together
I danced my blues away
They're gone forever
Then I ease on down to the disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
(Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Clap your hands
Just stomp your feet, alright
Get on down, get on down
Just get on down

Sing the song, children
Boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie

Oh, yeah
Keep on, keep on
Keep on

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

// Ninety-Nine And A Half //

I got to have all your love, night and day
Not just a little part, but all of your heart, sugar

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

Don't be led in the wrong direction
To start this thing off right, a man need a little love and affection
Yes he do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

All right. Lookie here

We got to bring it all down, start gettin' it right
We got to stop this messin' around, and keep the thing up tight
Yes we do, now

Ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Oh, no, no, just won't get it

All right, sugar
Got to have a hundred
Got to have a hundred
All right
Ooh, I must do, I must do
I must do now

Oh! Got to have a hundred
Got to have a hundred
Oh! Got to have a hu-hu-hu-hu-hu-hundred, too right
Got to have a hundred, now. Oh

// Hooked For Life //

Since the day, you gave your love to me
Oh, I confess I need it constantly
No remedy could ever cure
This pain you have on me
So I'm yours, my dear
Until eternity, it's you or me

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

I'm hooked for life, hooked for life
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life, yeah
(Hooked for life)

It's all right

People say, ooh, that you're no good for me
What misery they say love's company

All they can see I'm chained and vowed
To this new love I've found
I'll be round
Till I'm put in a clown, you're safe and sound

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Told you baby, yeah
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life, yes, I am
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
For your love I'm makin' a sacrifice
Like a man with a monkey on his back I'm hooked for life
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
Can't you see, just you and me
We together till eternity
(Hooked for life)

(Hooked for life, hooked for life)
There's no remedy
