The fire's inside us tonight
These bridges will burn so bright
Tomorrow bears our name
No more power games



Reaching for the light beyond
We will rise through the dark again
Ready to fight for what we believe to be right
Yesterday is dead and gone


Rattling the chains - shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt - we want out
This is reckoning day


We are standing in the flames
Reaching for the sky
Fight to the end
Yesterday is dead and gone

Under a blood red sky
Our voice will be heard in a world

Where compassion is lost
You try to control us
This is so absurd
Freedom will be won at any cost







Yesterday is dead and gone







This is reckoning time
Yesterday is dead and gone
