Ride

They came at dawn into the morning light
Black shadows ridin' on the mist
Prepared for battle swords were shinin' bright
Filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm

The sound of metal screamin' in the air
The time has come where justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now who were the fools

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

They're fighting hard their way of victory
Dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
And their swords spinnin' around

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

They're fightin' with power
Ready to ride
Let go

They got it all
They'll never fall
But they will fight

The night is fallin', light will disappear
A magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning shinin' crystal clear
Now they were lost for the chase

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

No no no no
