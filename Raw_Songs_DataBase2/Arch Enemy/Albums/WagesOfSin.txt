Album: WagesOfSin

// Diva Satanica //

Divine queen of evil
Sowing her seeds of hate
Mistress of pain
Diva Satanica - Master of temptation

Medusa... abuser... both beast and beauty
Seducer... she'll use you... bring you to your knees

Blinded by her infinite beauty
you are lured into the temple
The smell of incense burning
this carnal pleasure yearning
Bride of Satan
Transgress the rules of this world
Too late you realize
this love is ripping you apart

Medusa... abuser... both beast and beauty
Seducer... she'll use you... as fodder for her dreams

Drinking the blood
Eating the flesh
She's getting high on you
Watching you die gives her a thrill
...There is always more blood to spill...

// Damnation's Way //

Set me free, let me out of here
From these chains to which I am bound
Time was always on your side
While my final hours slipped away

[Chorus:]
Frustration in their minds
The hatred in their eyes
A new breed will now rise
Damnation's way

Losing my grip on reality
Outside this cage I am struck by paranoia
A paradox to all life's mysteries
A never ending trail to follow

I am the sinner upon damnation's way
Always deprived of hope, never to see the break of dawn
My life I lived in the shadow of you
The other side now greets me with open arms

// Fields Of Desolation '99 //

On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each others arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom

On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination

Why don't you cover me
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where the end begins
In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?

As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold wind blows
Is this the end of it all
I don't know, I don't know

[Pre-chorus melodies - Michael]

[End solo - Christopher]

// Enemy Within //

Dark thoughts rise up
Deep in your mind
The killing of hope
The end has begun

The locked psycho-door breaks down
The beast breathes freedom and fire
Blows bloody thoughts into your mind
Demons whisper: "COMMIT SUICIDE!"

Weak is your body,
Helpless your soul,
The beast destroyed your will
Left nothing but an empty shell

Self-destruction leads its way
Your weapons turn against yourself
Cutting through, killing you
A downward spiral, the shadowbeast has won

The shadowbeast calls
A vulture of life
Your worst enemy dwells
From within

// Burning Angel //

Dark shadows from above
Ravens fly, obliterate the sun
"It's a sign of the devil.
He will come for his servant tonight"
These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies

Am I to burn
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake.
Innocent blood that can never be washed clean

The flames of ignorance
Grow higher and higher
Licking my flesh - burning my soul
The raven laughing in the moon

These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats.
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies again...

// Heart Of Darkness //

You can't kill me. I am living inside you.
I am a part of your existence
Twisted thoughts in a twisted mind
Provoking you

Black is my heart - dark is my soul
My hatred I can not control
Evil seed growing stronger
Your freewill... Dying!

Inside you - heart of darkness
A part of you - heart of darkness

To deny me, is to deny yourself.
The illusion is dissolved
You are no longer in control
The facade crumbles - the transition is complete

...The transition is complete

I come to you in the night
I am your dark subconscience
I keep you awake, knowing
I am the heart of darkness

[1st Lead - Michael]
[2nd Lead - Christopher]

// Ravenous //

I am hunting for your soul
It dwells within your heart
I lacerate the pounding flesh
Your spirits shall be mine

[Harmony - Michael and Christopher]

So rise my spirit rise!
Revel in this dead mans' body
Grip his soul, sip the blood
Life is death
A holy carnage

[Lead - Christopher]

Ravenous
I will be your god
Carnivorous Jesus
I need your flesh

Ritual slaughter
Fill up the chalice
With the essence of your life
Liquid strengths
Trapped in your veins
I crave your blood
You must die!

[1st Lead - Michael]
[2nd Lead - Christopher]

// Savage Messiah //

Meet your maker
Rising from the ashes
Like a phoenix to the sky
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great lawgiver
So high and mighty

The immaculate deception
A taker of life
With unbridled aggression
Striking down on the disbelievers

Savage - Messiah
Take us higher
Savage - Messiah
Take us now!

Blessed in blood
We are reborn in hate
Thousands of spirits cry
So intense, so glorious...

Uncontrollable desire
For our souls
The great Messiah
So high and mighty

// Dead Bury Their Dead //

I leave the anguish behind
Scars are healing - I am set free
The chains of guilt are in the past
They no longer have a hold on me

Dead bury their dead

[Lead - Christopher]

I walk through Elysian Fields
The light is shining on me

Time marches on...

// Web Of Lies //

Weaving a web - of lies and deceit
It's a dangerous game - we play

All this time - the pain eating us away
All this time - the memories refuse to fade
A rotting shell of dying trust
We share this hell at any cost

Phases and stages
Circles and cycles
And empty charade
This pointless masquerade

A dangerous game
A dangerous game - we play

Web of lies
I can see it in your eyes
Web of lies
You can see it in my eyes

It will never be the same
We have gone too far this time
Our temple of false dreams
Comes crashing down...
A rotting shell of dying trust
We shared this hell at any cost

[1st Lead - Christopher]
[2nd Lead - Michael]

// The First Deadly Sin //

Step inside the circle of fire
Flames of desire enlighten the night
Follow your instinct
Burn and writhe in ecstasy

Love will turn to hate
Heat will turn to ice
There is nothing in between
The first deadly sin

Ancient taboo takes control
The demon eve possesses your soul
Riding high above the flames
You will step into hell

[Lead and slide solo - Christopher]

Dwell in passionate evil
Forbidden fruits of lust
Embrace and kiss the face of death
It's your first deadly sin

// Behind The Smile //

Sands of time
Running through my fingers
My life slipping away
And I feel nothing
Swallow the tears

Eat the pain - It's worth the degradation - Eat the pain

Behind the smile / I feel nothing
I reach out to touch, but I'm not really there

This reflection in the mirror
Can't reality be me
I see no connection
With who I wanted to be
Drink another glass
Swallow these pills

At the end of the rainbow
You take the bitter
The bitter with the sweet

When love dies
The angels cry
Here I am
Alone... Alone in a crowd

[Lead - Christopher]

// Shadows And Dust //

[Lead - Christopher]

At the mercy of our conscience
Confined within our fate
Never really questioned why
We are refugees in a dying world

To become a part of the end

Are we the ones, the ones to blame?
We are mortals of shadows and dust

[Lead melody - Michael]

The sun sets on our sinking ship of fools
On our journey into oblivion
We ask ourselves again and again
Now will we be remembered

[Lead - Michael]

Shadows...
And dust...

// Lament Of A Mortal Soul //

I am forced to creep down the path
Of my sad and senseless life
Darkness surrounds me
At the end of the tunnel there is no light

A blackened void, nothingness

Lament of a mortal soul
Who am I?
Only dust in the blowing wind
Am I dying?

My name dies slowly
Echoes into eternal oblivion
Replaced by others, castly forgotten
I hate my empty existence

[1st Lead - Christopher]
[2nd Lead - Michael]

Lament of a mortal soul
Who am I?
Only dust in the blowing wind
...I am dying!
