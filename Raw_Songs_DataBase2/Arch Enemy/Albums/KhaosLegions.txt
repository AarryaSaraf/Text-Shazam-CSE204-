Album: KhaosLegions

// Khaos Overture //

[Instrumental]

From the ashes of a corrupt undying world
They raise like a phoenix
A godless entity
They are the Khaos Legions

// Yesterday Is Dead And Gone //

The fire's inside us tonight
These bridges will burn so bright
Tomorrow bears our name
No more power games

[Harmony Lead - Michael & Christopher]

Reaching for the light beyond
We will rise through the dark again
Ready to fight for what we believe to be right
Yesterday is dead and gone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Rattling the chains - shaking the cage
Heed our war cry
Let there be no doubt - we want out
This is reckoning day

[Chorus (melody - Michael):]
We are standing in the flames
Reaching for the sky
Fight to the end
Yesterday is dead and gone

Under a blood red sky
Our voice will be heard in a world

Where compassion is lost
You try to control us
This is so absurd
Freedom will be won at any cost

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Lead - Christopher]

Yesterday is dead and gone

[Lead - Michael]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Outro lead - Christopher]

This is reckoning time
Yesterday is dead and gone

// Bloodstained Cross //

Gripping the strength of belief
Old tales and lies you trust
In the end there is no relief
A final breath you're breathing dust

[Lead - Christopher]

Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul

All the prayers in this world
Won't help you now

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

A perverted truth your reality
Forced your beliefs on the weak
Power twisted by years of abuse
The strong shall inherit the meek

Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul

All the prayers in this world
Won't help you now

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

[Mike solo]

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

[Harmony lead - Michael & Christopher]

[Under solo:]
All the prayers in this world
Won't help you now

// Under Black Flags We March //

Your hate is our trigger
Revolution now
The more we have to suffer
The more we will fight

With our fists up in the air!

Legions marching ready to fire
These streets will burn - let the black flag rise
Legions marching ready to fire
Empires of corruption - crash and fall

Under black flags we march...

The voice of rebellion calls your name
Servants of the truth are standing tall

With our fists up in the air!

Legions marching ready to fire
These streets will burn - let the black flag rise
Legions marching ready to fire
Empires of corruption - crash and fall

[Harmony lead - Michael & Christopher]

Legions marching ready to fire
These streets will burn - let the black flag rise
Legions marching ready to fire
Empires of corruption - crash and...

// No Gods, No Masters //

Here I am, back to the wall,
I picked the fight against the time,
Free at last I go my own way,
I will resist them, till the day I die,
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

There is no second place,
No perfect world,
Your head is whole,
Freedom in your heart,
Be strong; take this chance,
Make your way; a better future comes.
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
No gods, no masters.

What doesn't kill us make us stronger.
Locked and loaded ready to strike,
You stand loud and proud, united as one.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

// City Of The Dead //

In this city of broken dreams
Monuments of death arise
This is the Necropolis
Where the nameless live and breathe

Rotten tombs of ancient kings
Days of glory are gone
A mockery to the living souls
Confined in darkness

Trapped inside these walls
Between their father's bones
Stillborn to this world
All their hopes are lost

Doomed to live on a burial ground
An empty shrine their home
The poorest of society
Find some shelter but no peace

Children play between the stones
Laughter echoes from the walls
Their cradle of innocent joy
Will be their grave of sorrow

Trapped inside these walls
Between their father's bones
Stillborn to this world
All their hopes are lost

No safety, no dignity, no light, no justice,
no future, no home and nowhere to go
Their misery, frustration, anger, depression,
sadness, madness will drown in hatred

[Lead - Michael / Christopher]

Trapped inside these walls
Between their father's bones
Stillborn to this world
All their hopes are lost

// Through The Eyes Of A Raven //

Broken bodies stiff from storms
Our spirits scarred to ice
The only witness left alive
The raven and its staring eyes

Taste the blood
Hear their cries
Horrifying genocide
We lost our paradise

Through the eyes of the raven
See the slaughter, your crimes
They will remember
And so shall I

[Melody - Christopher]

When I die
Let the ravens fly
Let my body lie
Under snow and blood

The wolves of war at your throat
Leave nothing but severed bones
Scattered upon battlefields
Life is the price you pay

He who is proud is not for long
He who is brave will be destroyed
Your murder a heavy crown
Layered with thorns of shame

Through the eyes of the raven
See the slaughter, your crimes
They will remember
And so shall I

[Melody - Christopher]

When I die
Let the ravens fly
Let my body lie
Under snow and blood
[2x]

[Lead - Michael / Christopher]

[Acoustic outro: Chords - Christopher, Melody - Michael]

// Cruelty Without Beauty //

Disinfected torture chamber
A scientific abattoir
Their death is the price of your progress
If these walls could talk, they'd scream

No empathy
No dignity

Cruelty without beauty
Cruelty without beauty

Archaic rhetoric your weak defense
Your victims have no choice, no voice
Look in their eyes, does it still make sense?
A plastic bag their burial gown

No empathy
No dignity

Cruelty without beauty
Cruelty without beauty

[Solos]

A legacy of evil you preserve
Their blood cannot be washed clean
In my eyes their brutal fate you deserve
In your dreams you will hear them scream

// Cult Of Chaos //

Chaos is creation
A swirling mass of atoms and ideas
Natural selection the sculptor of all life

Survival of the fittest, all your tall tales are dead
We are legion, one will and one heartbeat

This is anarchy
We are a godless entity

[Lead - Christopher]

There are many ways to die
But only one way to live
Let the cult of chaos reign
Be as free as you can be

[Melody - Michael]
[Lead - Christopher]

Confusion, diffusion, your system in turmoil
Disillusion, revolution, the storm to cleanse this world
False prophets, propaganda
Speak in tongues and dead words
'Til the fangs of reality
Will sink into their throats

This is anarchy
We are a godless entity

There are many ways to die
But only one way to live
Let the cult of chaos reign
Be as free as you can be

[Melody - Michael]

There will be dead silence and then a new beginning
Let the cult of chaos reign

[Melody - Christopher]
[Lead - Christopher]

There are many ways to die
But only one way to live
Let the cult of chaos reign
Be as free as you can be
[2x]

// Thorns In My Flesh //

[Intro lead - Michael]

Liar, liar
Conceal the truth
Severed tongue
With a serpent's fire
Beggar, pursuer
Master of deceit
With your own interest at heart

When it all came to light
Innocence was lost
How do you sleep at night
Lost trust turned to dust

[Lead - Christopher]

All for one, one for all
Did not apply to you
An intricate web of lies
As the wheels kept on turning

[Melody - Michael]

No more thorns in my flesh
No more chains hold me down
I control my destiny

[Lead - Michael]

Liar, liar
Conceal the truth
Severed tongue
With a serpent's fire
Beggar, pursuer
Master of deceit
With your own interest at heart

When it all came to light
Innocence was lost
How do you sleep at night
Lost trust turned to dust

[Melody - Michael]

No more thorns in my flesh
No more chains hold me down
I control my destiny

[Lead - Christopher]

[Melody - Michael]

No more thorns in my flesh
No more chains hold me down
I control my destiny

[Outro lead - Michael]

// Vengeance Is Mine //

Infestation
Of spirit and flesh

Indignation
Is all you left me with

Domination
Your ultimate goal

Transmigration
You will lose control

[Lead - Christopher]

I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long

[Harmony - Michael & Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

[Lead - Michael / Christopher]

Laceration
Of my mind and soul

Alteration
Your truth is full of lies

Liberation
Sweet revenge is mine

Devastation
You will burn in my hell

[Lead - Christopher]

I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long

[Harmony - Michael & Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

Vengeance is mine!

[Lead - Christopher]

[Harmony - Michael & Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

// Secrets //

[Intro melody - Michael]

I've got a secret - I just can't tell
I have created my own hell
If you knew what I know
It would change your perfect world

Locked the vault - Thrown away the key
My lips are forever sealed
Buried in a place you'll never see
This secret dies with me

Don't ask me - For I cannot tell
Words can kill - Sharp as a blade of steel

Skeletons of the past...

This burden, this pain
Were all these tears in vain?
Memories of the past return
This one is going with me to the grave

It is beating me up inside
To that I must confess
Secret weighing down my soul
Until I draw my very last breath

Don't ask me - For I cannot tell
Words can kill - Sharp as a blade of steel

Skeletons of the past...
Skeletons of the past...

[Lead - Michael]

Skeletons of the past...
Skeletons of the past...

[Lead - Christopher]
[Outro melody - Michael]
