// Taking Back My Soul //

Processed, diluted
Virtually unrecognizable
I was lost there - No direction
A scattered void

No more
It's over
I'm on to you
Your evil game
The tables have turned
I am taking back my soul

Tranquilized, Scrutinized
Hate injected mind
As if internal wounds
Wouldn't bleed, Wouldn't hurt me

I see through your lies
Taking back what's mine

// Nemesis //

We walk this Earth
With fire in our hands
Eye for an eye
We are Nemesis

We are with you
Countless vicious souls
Fight! - Fighting for freedom
United we stand

We are legion
Voice of anarchy
This is revolution
Creating new disorder

We are enemy
Opponent of the system
Crushing hypocrisy
Slaying the philistine

One for all - All for one
We are strong - We are one
Nemesis

A malicious fever burns
In our hearts, In our veins
Your blood, My blood
All blood runs the same

// My Apocalypse //

Sudden implosion of silenced emotions
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
Delusions of hope fading away
Dying like leaves on frozen soil

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... Coming here

Neglecting existence, repulse and repent
An endless journey into the morbid
Whispering voices distorting all senses
Buried beneath a scattered heart for all too long

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... Coming here

The bitter taste of a dying dream
Shine the light on our shadows and illusions

// Carry The Cross //

We walk through the ages
The world on our shoulders
A burden we carry
To the dark end of our days
A thousand eyes watching
Every step we are taking
Waiting to see us
Struggle and fall

And when we are beaten
The cross holds us down
I hear them laughing
And walking away

Carry the cross
And suffer the loss
Hear my confession
Forever damnation

Reincarnation
Bleeding forever
Recover in pain
Pain gives me strength
Pick up the cross
And carry it on
Over and over
The wheel turns again

And when we are beaten
The cross holds us down
I hear them laughing
And walking away

Carry the cross
And suffer the loss
Hear my confession
Forever damnation

// I Am Legend / Out For Blood //

I am after you
A shadow on the hunt
Don't turn around
I am right behind you

I will get to you
And take you down
Tear your insides out
Crush your soul

I am out for blood
Out for your blood

I am harder than steel
Break your will
Waiting all my life
To kill

I will get to you
And take you down
Tear your insides out
Crush your soul

I am out for blood
Out for your blood

I can smell your flesh
I can taste your sweat
I can sense your fear
I am right here

// Skeleton Dance //

On a journey ill
My mind floats astray
Over withered fields
I cross the river

This shortness of breath
Between birth and grave
Fading in the distance
I am nothing

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death

Here I am alone
Casting my own shadows
Traversing the mundane
Desperate cry

Boundless darkness
A voiceless fear
Unheard, Unseen
It is coming near

Watch the skeleton dance
Dancing on my grave
My frozen hour of death
Watch the skeleton dance
Here I am - Alone...

Had I not known
That I was dead
I would have mourned
My loss of life
Loss of life...

Between birth and grave
Here I am alone

// Mechanic God Creation //

The human race
Like a chromatic stain
Lost in concrete fields
Hybrids of steel

Mechanic god creation
Enter annihilation

We are rendered obsolete
Just a relic at their feet
Not cold enough - Too human

The doomsday machine
Created by man
Like a black dawn rising
To conquer - Conquer and destroy

Mechanic god creation
Enter annihilation

Climbing the walls
The walls are too high
They swallow the Sun
Ebony sky

We are rendered obsolete
Just a relic at their feet
Not cold enough - Too human

// Machtskampf //

Flying high on blackened wings
Vengeance in my eyes
Colder than steel, instantly real
A new power flows in me

Reaching out for something
Knowing that it's there - Somewhere

All I had was
All I gave
Was it not enough?
You took
You take
Never giving anything back

Bridges that I thought I crossed
Got to cross them all again
These paths that lead to nowhere
Mocked me all my life

Make a change
Break the chain
Make a change
End this game

Vengeance in my eyes
A new power flows in me

// Slaves Of Yesterday //

Monuments of dying dreams
As far away as Eden
These hours standing still
Finding comfort in a distant past

Slaves of yesterday
You are blind
Blind to the sunrise

A roaming spirit, Forever lost
Among the living
Walking down the fatal road
Cursed to be left behind

Slaves of yesterday
You are blind
Blind to the sunrise
