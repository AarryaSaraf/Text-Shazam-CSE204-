// Tempore Nihil Sanat (Prelude In F Minor) //

De fumo in flammam
Tempore nihil sanat
Noli ignoscere
Noli oblivisci
Odire humanum est

// Never Forgive, Never Forget //

See the wolf in sheep's skin
Waiting in the shadows
Watching, learning...too bad I did not recognize
The dark undertow
Pulling you away
We've been infiltrated, in fact violated
Carefully orchestrated

Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing
I'll never forgive
Never forget

You swallowed the lies
In a search for inner peace
With open ears and eyes
Could you not feel 
The dark undertow
Pulling you down
You've been infiltrated, in fact violated
Ultimately desecrated

When the dust has settled
I'll watch you drown, drown in your regret

// War Eternal //

Friend or foe?
There's no way to know
In the battlefield of life
It's kill or be killed
So many times
It's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck
To down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

It's times like these
When lines are drawn
Which side of the fence
Are you standing on?
There will come a day
Not so far away
When the hunter
Becomes the prey
(and you will pay)

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

This is fucking war!

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

// As The Pages Burn //

As the pages burn
Secrets can't be unlearned
Silence can't be unheard
Knowledge is burden
Power is onus
As the pages burn
Your memories fade
Freed from the grip of reality
Rejecting cognition
As the pages turn
Sinking in a pool of ether
The past is washed clean

Rip apart the world
Word by word, inch by inch
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn

As the smoke fills the room
Soon to pass, heavy gloom
The wind will whisk away the past
A blank page stares at you
Nothing left
Where to start?
A second chance carries expectation
The books you'd written no longer exist
The future is in your pen
Ink to paper, now begin

Rip apart the world
Word by word, inch by inch
Sever your timeline
Silence your conscience

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn

Rewriting history
Starting now
Erase the misery
Let the flames
Eat your doubts

Sweet amnesia
Here to free you
As the pages burn
All your trials
Solved by fire
As the pages burn

// No More Regrets //

You choose your path
Don't shift the blame
You ran your course
You lost sight of your aim
Wrong choices linger
Like scars remain
Long after the bleeding stops
There's nowhere left to hide from the shame

Never again

No! No more regrets
What's done is done - can't be erased
Know your regrets... savour the bitter aftertaste

The crippling guilt, how heavy it can be
When searching for the right words
Hoping the truth will bring you peace
A lesson learned is good company
For the lonely road you walk
Each step forward - agony

Never again

No! No more regrets
What's done is done - can't be erased
Know your regrets... savour the bitter aftertaste

It's hard to breathe
Thought process crushing me
Purge mistakes! Strip the mind of its dignity

Liar
Liar

Never again

No! No more regrets
What's done is done - can't be erased
Know your regrets... savour the bitter aftertaste

No more! What's done is done - can't be erased
All I know is but regret
I can't shake this bitter aftertaste

// You Will Know My Name //

The judging eyes watching me
Is all I've ever known
When I try to open up my heart
I am ridiculed and torn apart

You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name

Today I break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies

No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense
There's something inside me
And I know it's good
I'm not evil, I'm just misunderstood.

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name
No longer invisible
You will know my name!

// Stolen Life //

Everything so clear now
It's written on your face
In a world within a world
I can smell the bridges burn
Sharks ever circling
They never go away
In these dark, murky waters
So hard to navigate and so easy to hate

Paint me black, demonize me, this is how you pay me back?
Do you ever really know someone until you look away?
Misplaced my trust, only to learn...honesty is just a word

This is a stolen life
Before you walk away
Don't forget to turn the knife

What's next, more betrayal?
Have I not suffered enough?
You made me feel so alive
Now you're just killing me killing me

Paint me black, demonize me, this is how you pay me back?
Do you ever really know someone until you look away?
Misplaced my trust, only to learn...honesty is just a word

This is a stolen life
Before you walk away
Don't forget to turn the knife
This is a stolen life

Carve away the rotten flesh
It's time to burn
Strip away the dirty lies
Expose the ugly truth...

Do you ever really know someone until you look away?
Misplaced my trust, only to learn...honesty is just a word

// Time Is Black //

From a distance, the truth is so obvious
Answers are all so clear
Logic stays at arm's length
When engulfed in the present, here
Desperation draws near

If I could pull the fabric of time
And bring the future near
The answers wouldn't be so far
The truth would be so clear

Time is black
Time is black
And nothing will escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing

From a distance time is black
Tangible and dense
With each rotation a new day passed
And past, at last, makes sense
There where past obstacles seem
Just pebbles on your path
Always just a step ahead
The peace I hope to catch

Time is black
Time is black
And nothing can escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing

Time is black
Time is black
And nothing will escape
Nothing will remain
Nothing will remain

// On And On //

We walk through war in the halls
Of dead protocols
We came so close, demands were met
That's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
A vicious crime...cold betrayal and deceit.

Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack.

On and on...
The battle knows no victory...
On and on...
Weapons high - Reject defeat.

Decrepit smiles shine like fire
Lying through their teeth.
It's a memory you want to forget...
From one second to another the whole world went under.
The future cuts so deep tangibility bleeds.

On and on! Until the victory is dead and gone.
On and on! Kill the history, the wrong side won!

Don't let the history repeat...

// Avalanche //

A fistful of fear in my hands
A bullet of betrayal in my brain
No progress comes from pleasure
We smile in ignorance and learn in pain

Willful deceit was your plan
Desperately avoid the blame
Who will you answer to now?
Sharpened your shovels
Just to dig your grave

Stand up because the ground is in your way
I won't give you any peace
Yet still you talk
Try to fight but I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Sick, sick, sick
I'm sick of being your martyr
Your inflated ego is just dead weight
Bask in all the eyes upon you
Before you know it
They'll have turned away

Stand up as the whole world turns away
I won't give you any peace
Yet still you talk
Try to fight but I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you expect?

Wait and see
Cry yourself a lonesome creek

Your decaying corpse
Can feed the roots
Of my towering tree

Just wait and see
You're dead to me

Yet still you speak
Trying to justify what you're doing to me

I will watch you fall
Fall

This is sweet revenge
And karma's a bitch
You glutton for punishment
What did you
What did you expect?

// Down To Nothing //

The light dwindles down to nothing
As the candle sputters out
Just beyond the abb and flow
Of a dark and restless heart

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Licking the wounds now
I shelter in the melody
My ink runs from black to red
Screaming into the void

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return
