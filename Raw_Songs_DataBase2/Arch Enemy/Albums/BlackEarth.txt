Album: BlackEarth

// Bury Me An Angel //

Symbolical and mystical
Between life and death we're torn
A constant struggle
Like an apocrypha
Nobody can be certain
A thousand days, spent in hell
The ultimate sacrifice
Your voyage starts
With a question mark
But the distant future
Will not tell

[Chorus:]
Bury me an angel
Set my black soul free!!

Blackened chariots
Bearing evil souls
Ride the surface of burning holes
Nocturnal... traveller
You represent the ruined spirit
Symbolical and mystical
You shall be damned for all time

[Lead - Michael]

// Dark Insanity //

Weak and sick I crawl
In the dust of past mistakes
Leaving for the darkness
Of tears and cold heartaches
Suffer in this grief
Of forever burning hate
The ashes of my life
By the torment you create

[Chorus:]
On my knees... remembering
The wasted years of dark insanity

The rage increases fast
As the memories eat me alive
God, I wish this to end
But I'm not prepared to die
No more a human being
Just a fool of anxiety
Unable to escape
The darkest insanity

[Lead - Christopher]

// Eureka //

Stumbling through
This complex puzzle that is my life
Thirsty for knowledge
But drinking from poisoned fountains
Flashbacks from my past
God knows how long I'll last
Images of you
Leading my soul astray

These four walls
Are closing in, suffocating me
My last wish is to
Transcend from this dimension of boredom
Wrap your arms around me
Like a circle around the sun
I loved you so
Why couldn't you love me?

[Chorus:]
EUREKA! - I found the secret of life!?
EUREKA!

// Idolatress //

These gardens of angst
In which I stand
Lost and confused
Hungry for more
Eager to cross
This river of tears

Safe in this void
In which I live
Free from despair
Weaving a web
Surrounding my soul
Imprisoned distress

[Chorus:]
In a world of dying angels
Trespassers on unknown domains

Traumatic defeat
This time I'll burn
For one thousand years
Bearing the truth
Deep down inside
It dies with me

Taste the pure salt
Of misery
Hell's ecstasy
Feel destiny
Breathe in your neck
Cut you so deep

[1st Lead - Michael]
[2nd Lead - Christopher]

Twisting my mind
Living in sin
Dying within
Wicked and mean
Sinister eyes
Staring at me

// Cosmic Retribution //

Behold the apocalypse
The end is closing in
Did you ever really doubt
That we would pay for our sins...

[Chorus:]
The heavens will burn
No one can save us now
Everything we once loved
Shall perish in flames...

Armageddon coming on
A black dawn slowly rising
The heat will slowly consume you
Like a moth around a flame

[1st lead - Michael]
[Acoustic Lead - Christopher]
[2nd Lead - Christopher]

Out of this silent planet
A single sign of life appears
A man made machine
Carrying an embryo of human life...

// Transmigration Macabre //

Trapped in a downward spiral of pain
Horrific memories, your life flashing by
There is no life left for you to live
You've had your share and more
Act of transfusion - blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past

Eternal damnation awaits you my love
In the kingdom of the sick and the rotting dead
You will suffer excruciating pain
You shall now reap the twisted fruit
Of what you once sowed
Transparent - revealing the lies
Transmutation - What you have become
Act of transfusion - blood child!
Transmigrate into the future or the past

[Chorus:] Transmigration macabre

// Fields Of Desolation //

On the fields of desolation
We are all alone
Crying in each others arms
In fear of the unknown
Feelings of uncertainty
We are all doomed
To live in solitude
And never ending gloom

On the fields of desolation
Eternal life or termination

Why don't you cover me
I need your sanctuary
This sea I'm drowning in
Might be where the end begins
In times of grief and sadness
We're searching for the light
Seek for a place of safety
Seek for a place to hide
God turned his back on man
In divine resignation
Torn between two believes
Eternal life or termination?

As we drown in darkness
Weak and depraved
On our final journey
Too late to be saved
We've gone through places
Where the cold wind blows
Is this the end of it all
I don't know, I don't know

[Pre-chorus melodies - Michael]
[End solo - Christopher]

// Losing Faith //

[Lead - Christopher]

As I walk alone
Paralysed and frozen
Weakened by the fact
It is the life that I have chosen

[Chorus:]
This is life that I believed in
Sentences me without mercy

Staring down the depths
Of the mind once again
Regret this way of living
Retrospectives in the end
Losing faith in heaven
Now conform to hell
Blindfolds of romance
This pain I can not bear
