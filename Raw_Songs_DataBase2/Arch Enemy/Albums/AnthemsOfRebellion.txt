Album: AnthemsOfRebellion

// Silent Wars //

This is killing us
Fighting the truth a losing battle
We believe in nothing
Just hatred for each other

Tragic sinister serenade
Twisted melody shatters reality
Dying hopes for a better day
Fragile dreams that break away

No more, no more
This pain must end

We have chosen to suffer
Believe in nothing but...

Hatred is a vicious circle
Betrayal is at hand
Paralysed souls bleeding
Begging for salvation
Deeper and deeper the wounds we cut
The truth burning our flesh
Silent war to set us free
Stigmata of a tragedy

No more, no more
This pain must end

We have chosen to suffer
Feeling nothing but hate
It's eating us up from the inside
Taking our feelings away

// We Will Rise //

Tear down the walls
Wake up the world
Ignorance is not bliss
So fed up with second best
Our time is here and now

I am the enemy
I am the antidote
Watch me closely
I will stand up - now

We will rise
Rise above

Stereotype Fools
Playing the game
Nothing unique
They all look the same
In this sea of mediocrity
I can be anything
Anything I want to be

We will rise

// Instinct //

The more I see - the less I believe
The more I hear - the less I care
This world we've created, has left me cold
This world is sedated, dying in it's sleep

I feel nothing

Seen it written on a thousand faces
The simple truth we fear
Seen it happen in a thousand places
Instinct brought us here

The more I see - the less I believe
The more I hear - the less I care
We used to be the chosen ones
Second to none
Look at what we've become
A pathetic excuse for life

I feel nothing

I can feel nothing
Nothing at all
Except for the pain
That hits me again

// Leader Of The Rats //

Crawling in the slime
Dirt infested minds
Always second best, leader of the rats
Spreading their disease

Hiding behind trivial cynicism
Venomous tongues spitting forth lies
So quick to criticize the life of others
Who are you to judge us

On a higher plain
Our art lives on forever
You are the scum beneath us
Fighting your pathetic battle

Anonymous animosity
Dirt infested minds

You hide behind trivial cynicism
Venomous tongues spitting forth lies
So quick to criticize the life of others
Who are you to judge us

Laughing right into your face
As we watch your infantile behaviour
Love us or hate us - we don't care
We never aimed to please you

Anonymous animosity
Dirt infested minds
Anonymous animosity
Spreading their disease

Always second best
Leader Of The Rats
Spreading their disease

// Exist To Exit //

Living in the shadows
Crawling in the dark
Another face - you will never see
Another voice - you will never hear

Erase my mortal shell
To feed my dying soul
Morbid glory shines on me
I will leave my mark

You will know
When I go
You will see
Exist to exit

Suicide - Escape oblivion
Kiss the blade of sharp, cold steel
The perfect day for my final exit
Hold your breath when I die

Art, action, reincarnation
Evolution through ritual death
Reborn as an infamous legend
Forever immortal, post-mortem fame

// Despicable Heros //

I spit in your face, preachers and leaders
Spewing false dogma to their believers
A nation of wolves haunting the sheep
Their fangs in your flesh
So painful and deep

Despise your heroes
Living a lie
Despicable heroes
Fooling the blind
(Open your mind)

Puppets on strings, face on the ground
Nothing more than a shallow farce
Consume the young, thoughtless ones
Eat their brain, leave them blind
And then destroy

I spit in the face of your preachers and leaders
Spewing false dogma to their believers
A nation of fools, nothing but sheep
Their fangs in your flesh, so painful and deep.

// End Of The Line //

Welcome to the circus
Leave your brain outside
Sit back - relax
As we feed you lies

Spoon fed stimulation
Glittering fashion fascination
You are lost in the game
Media corruption

You'll be amused
By the things we do to you
But in the bitter end
The clown is you

End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You are better off dead

You had one life
You had one shot
You blew it
And you knew it
The rot sets in
No self control
At the end of the line
You play the fool

// Dehumanization //

This is the age of dehumanization
Perverted creation
Damned, misled children
You never stood a chance
Resurrection a dead messiah
For a paralysed race
Damned, misled children
You never stood a chance

Infected
Neglected
The new breed of a generation to come
Rejected
Illfated
The new breed - a generation to kill

Sowing the seed of suffering
Upon these fertile hearts
Damned, misled children
You never stood a chance
Chosen to be slaughtered
By the masters of manipulation
Damned, misled children
You never stood a chance

Infected
Neglected
The new breed of a generation to come
Rejected
Illfated
The new breed
Parasites
A generation to kill

// Saints And Sinners //

Born with eyes
But they are not to see
Living on your knees
Choking on your spiritual agony
Follow the traces of blood
Throughout the past centuries
You choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the altar of shame

You strive for perfection
But you don't have the tools
Human weakness embodied
Fodder for fools
Feeding the fear of life itself
Over and over again
And choose not to see

Bow down and worship me at the altar of shame

So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand
You're the saint and I'm the sinner
No - you will never understand

Born with eyes
But they are not to see
Living on your knees
Choking on your spiritual agony
Follow the traces of blood
Throughout the past centuries
You choose not to see
Bow down and worship me at the altar of shame

So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand
You're the saint and I'm the sinner
No - you will never understand

So you're the saint and I'm the sinner?
You will never understand
You're the saint and I'm the sinner
No - you will never understand
