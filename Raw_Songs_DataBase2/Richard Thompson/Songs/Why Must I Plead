All your bitterness and lies
Sting like tears in my eyes
And a thousand lovesick tunes
Won't wash away the wounds from my mind

You've been seen around, you're a news sensation
You got a better deal and you took his invitation
You've been sitting on his lap and taking his dictation

Mercy, we used to love all day and drive all night
Mercy, jealousy used to whet your appetite
Mercy, we were low as dogs and high as kites
Why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine

My friends are indiscreet
And I sing myself to sleep
And I don't mind the red wine
Or the pickup line as long as it's cheap

I ask you what's wrong, and you say I'm all yours
I ask who your friend is, and you say Santa Clause
I ask you to come home, you say you're tired of being indoors

Mercy, you know you signed on that dotted line
Mercy, you signed yours and I signed mine
Mercy, you said forever till the end of time
Why must I plead with you darling
For what's already mine
