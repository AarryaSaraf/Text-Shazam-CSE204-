Here she comes and there she goes
Nothing on her fingers, nothing on her toes
Why she comes, nobody knows
Here comes Shaky Nancy

Don't be believing she melts in your hand
Runs with the tide and she shifts with the sand
Sends you a message and turns to stone
She's a hard girl, Nancy

One cold morning, ice on the sea
Shaky Nancy, won't you lean on me?
Must mean something, how can you lose?
There's nothing choosy or chancy

Here she comes and there she goes
Nothing on her fingers, nothing on her toes
Why she comes, nobody knows
Here comes Shaky Nancy

Nancy went walking, she's gone for the day
When she comes back, she's been two years away
But still tears in her eyes
Who'll say a prayer for Nancy?

Here she comes and there she goes
Nothing on her fingers, nothing on her toes
Why she comes, nobody knows
Here comes Shaky Nancy

Just throw me a bottle, call me a bore
And you throw what's left of me into the hall
I'll take a sleep, I'll take a sleep
And I'll dream sweet dreams of Nancy

Here she comes and there she goes
Nothing on her fingers, nothing on her toes
Why she comes, nobody knows
Here comes Shaky Nancy
