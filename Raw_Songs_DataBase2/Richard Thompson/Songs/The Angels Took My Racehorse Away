Well, the angels came to see me today
Said "We've taken your racehorse away"
And I believe it was that bookmaker from 
I believe that he put one in a pail
Oh, the finest in the field only measure to our shoulders
They only ever see our heels
And I believe every sporting man will cry
I believe they'll see everything come passing by

She won the Lanark Silver Bell
And she stole every heart away
She stood her stand at sixteen hands
And I'll ride her easy
But they've taken, taken my racehorse away

There's a racecourse in the sky
And that's where all the racing horses must go by and by
And I believe every steward, lord and groom
I believe that they're calling her home

She would look me in the eye
And that was all she had to say
She stood her stand at sixteen hands
And I'll ride her easy
But they've taken, taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
They've taken my racehorse away
Taken my racehorse away
