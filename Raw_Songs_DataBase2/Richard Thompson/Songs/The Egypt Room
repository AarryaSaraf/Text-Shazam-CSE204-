Now Hobnail Kelly and the Beefcake Kid
Just rolled into town from the land of sewn-up faces
Looking for a woman who can punch and kick and bite
Slide on down to the Egypt Room
Find the only woman who's holding all the aces
The Princess is dancing at the Egypt Room tonight

Don't be late (don't be late)
Don't be late (don't be late)
Don't be late

She's a nightclub floosie, nothing but a tramp
But she moves like a snake and she shimmies like a fish in the ocean
She can fool with a man till he doesn't know wrong from right
She's got diamonds flashing, ruby rings
She sparkles like the Nile when she does her original motion
The princess is dancing at the Egypt Room tonight

Now don't be late (don't be late)
Ah don't be late (don't be late)
Oh don't be late

The man with the cane and Italian shoes
He walks like a lion looking for a lonely Christian
He peeps at the princess and his bloodshot eyes open wide
He says "Meet me, Princess, after the show
I'm a gambling man but I think I like your system
I'll see you at the back of the Egypt Room tonight"

Now don't be late (don't be late)
Oh don't be late (don't be late)
Ah don't be late
