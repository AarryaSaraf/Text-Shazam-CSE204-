Keep your weight on the dead man's handle
Or the wheels won't hold the rail
Keep your weight on the dead man's handle
Or the steam brake's bound to fail
Woah she'll jump boys and she'll slip
If your hand should lose it's grip
On the dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
Keep your mind on the journey's end

Remember all of your skills and learning
Gonna need them now
Remember all of your words of warning
Gonna need them now
There's just one bridge left to cross
Keep her moving or the day is lost
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
Keep your mind on the journey's end

Look down, look down, look down
The valley is burning, fire without end
Look down, look down, look down
And you'll never get back on the tracks again

Keep your weight on the dead man's handle
Till you see that the day is won
Too many's the foolish man who's fallen
'Cause he jumped the gun
See ahead, your brother stands
Ease the brake, stretch out your hand
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
Keep your mind on the journey's end

Keep your weight on the dead man's handle
Or the wheels won't hold the rail
Keep your weight on the dead man's handle
Or the steam brake's bound to fail
Oh she'll jump boys and she'll slip
If your hand should lose it's grip
On the dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
The dead man's handle
Keep your mind on the journey's end
Ah keep your mind on the journey's end
