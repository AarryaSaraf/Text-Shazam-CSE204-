I was walking down the street when I met with Billy
He shook his head at me and then he shook my hand
He said "I've seen the world, I've done some living
I don't believe in giving, you've got to take it while you can"

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

He said "I'm sick of whores, madams and misses
The only kiss for me is the kiss of a knife
There's no one thing on earth that I'm not through with
What can I do with the rest of my life?"

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

Billy turned and he walked away. He said "I must be going
There's just no knowing who follows me around
They see my fancy clothes and they want to shoot me
I'd rather be dead on my feet than dead down in the ground"

I'm an old man inside a young man
You've got to take it while you can
I'm just an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can

I'm just an old man inside a young man
You've got to to take it while you can
I'm an old man inside a young man
Take a heart and break it while you can
