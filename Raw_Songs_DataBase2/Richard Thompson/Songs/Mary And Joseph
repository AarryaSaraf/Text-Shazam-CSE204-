Mary and Joseph were watching their bother
Lovers with a different past, like the one that loves a rose
Mary is in stitches, she's tied down on the bed
While Joseph plays a ukulele standing on his head
Sad is the hour that saw them divided
People with a common blood, parted in the name of God
The father and the mother of the royal king on earth
He'll only come when hearts are joined and peace rings in his berth
