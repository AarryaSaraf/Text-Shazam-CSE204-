Today I've been busy removing
I'm all of a fidgety-fidge
My last digs were on The Embankment
The third seat from Waterloo Bridge
But the cooking and oh the attendance
Didn't happen to suit me so well
So I ordered my man to pack up and
Look out for another hotel
He did and the new place is extra I vow
Just wait till I tell you where I'm staying now

I live in Trafalgar Square
Four lions to guard me
Fountains and statues all over the place
The Metropole staring me right in the face
I'll admit it's a trifle draughty
But I look at it this way, you see
If it's good enough for Nelson
It's quite good enough for me

Now the beds ain't so soft as they might be
Still the temperature's never too high
And it's nice to see swells who are passing
Look on you with envious eye
And when you wake up in the morning
What nicer thing could there be
Than to have a good walk for your breakfast
And the same for your dinner and tea?
Oh there's many a swell up in Park Lane tonight
Who'd be glad if he only had my appetite

I live in Trafalgar Square
Four lions to guard me
Fountains and statues all over the place
The Metropole staring me right in the face
I'll admit it's a trifle draughty
But I look at it this way, you see
If it's good enough for Nelson
Oh it's quite good enough for me
If it's good enough for Nelson
Oh it's quite good enough for me
