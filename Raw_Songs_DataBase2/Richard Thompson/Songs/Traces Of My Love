The songbird sings so clear
Like your voice upon my ear
I seem to hear traces of my love

The river rushes down
There's sweetness in the sound
I seem to hear traces of my love

When I lay on my bed
I find no rest, instead I seem to see
You here with me
Oh will that sweet day ever be
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love

In every crowded place
In every stranger's face
I seem to see traces of my love

Inside my darkest day
When the world seems cold and grey
I seem to see traces of my love

If I try to turn my head
Or close my eyes
Instead I see you there
Oh everywhere
Shadows of a face so rare
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love

If I try to turn my head
Or close my eyes
Instead I see you there
Oh everywhere
Shadows of a face so rare
Oh, oh traces of my love
Oh, oh traces of my love
