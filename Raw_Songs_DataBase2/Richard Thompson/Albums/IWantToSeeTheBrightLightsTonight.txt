// When I Get To The Border //

Dirty people take what's mine
I can leave them all behind
They can never cross that line
When I get to the border
Sawbones standing at the door
Waiting till I hit the floor
He won't find me anymore
When I get to the border

Monday morning, Monday morning
Closing in on me
I'm packing up and I'm running away
To where nobody picks on me

If you see a box of pine
With a name that looks like mine
Just say I drowned in a barrel of wine
When I got to the border
When I got to the border

A one way ticket's in my hand
Heading for the chosen land
My troubles will all turn to sand
When I get to the border

Salty girl with yellow hair
Waiting in that rocking chair
And if I'm weary I won't care
When I get to the border

Monday morning, Monday morning
Closing in on me
I'm packing up and I'm running away
To where nobody picks on me

The dusty road will smell so sweet
Paved with gold beneath my feet
And I'll be dancing down the street
When I get to the border
When I get to the border

// The Calvary Cross //

I was under the Calvary Cross
The pale-faced lady she said to me
I've watched you with my one green eye
And I'll hurt you till you need me
You scuff your heels and you spit on your shoes
You do nothing with reason
One day you catch a train
Never leaves the station

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me

Now you can make believe on your tin whistle
Ah, you can be my broom boy
Scrub me till I shine in the dark
I'll be your light till doomsday
Oh, it's a black cat cross your path
And why don't you follow
My claw's in you and my light's in you
This is your first day of sorrow

Everything you do
Everything you do
You do for me

// Withered And Died //

This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died

Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind words in my ear, kind faces to see

Then I struck up with a boy from the West
Played run and hide, played run and hide
Count one to ten and he's gone with the rest
My dreams have withered and died

Silver moon sail up and silver moon shine
On the waters so wide, waters so wide
Steal from the bed of some good friend of mine
My dreams are withered and died

If I was a butterfly, lived for a day
I could be free just blowing away

This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died

// We Sing Hallelujah //

A man is like a rusty wheel
On a rusty cart
He sings his song as he rattles along
And then he falls apart

And we'll sing hallelujah
At the turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

A man is like a briar
He covers himself with thorns
He laughs like a clown when his fortune's down
And his clothes are ragged and torn

And we'll sing hallelujah
At the turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

A man is like a three string fiddle
Hanging up on the wall
He plays when somebody scrapes on the bow
Or he can't play at all

And we'll sing hallelujah
At the turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

A man is like his father
Wishes he never was born
He longs for the time when the clock will chime
And he's dead forevermore

And we'll sing hallelujah
At the turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

And we'll sing hallelujah
At the turning of the year
And we work all day in the old-fashioned way
Till the shining star appears

// Has He Got A Friend For Me //

Saturday night and I'm all alone
No ring on the door bell, no ring on the phone
And nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me

Your boy friend's good looking, he's got it all there
He looks like God made him with something to spare
You look good together, scurrying off down the street

Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me

He's got the haunt of the sea in his eyes
He wouldn't notice me passing by
I could be in the gutter, or dangling down from a tree

If you know someone who is graceful and wise
Doesn't mind girls who are clumsy and shy
I don't mind going with someone that I've never seen

Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me
Has he got a friend, has he got a friend for me

// The Little Beggar Girl //

I'm just a little beggar girl and Sally is my name
You can call me a skiver and I'll call you the same
You can show me you're sorry if you think it's a shame
That I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
You can show me you're sorry if you think it's a shame
That I'm only a poor little beggar girl

I'll dance with my peg leg a-wiggling at the knee
I'll play on the accordion my father gave to me
For it's well worth it all to please a gent such as thee
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And it's well worth it all to please a gent such as thee
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl

I've been down to London, I've been up to Crewe
I travel far and wide to do the work that I do
'Cause I love taking money off a snob like you
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And I love taking money off a snob like you
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl

Oh the poor they will be rich and the rich they will be poor
That's according to Saul when he wrote down the law
And I'd much rather be rich after than before
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
And I'd much rather be rich after than before
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl

If the words of my song do your conscience alarm
Just remember generosity is like a lucky charm
If you give me your money, it'll do you no harm
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl
Yes I'm only a poor little beggar girl
If you give me your money, it'll do you no harm
For I'm only a poor little beggar girl

// The End Of The Rainbow //

I feel for you, you little horror
Safe at your mother's breast
No lucky break for you around the corner
'Cause your father is a bully
And he thinks that you're a pest
And your sister she's no better than a whore

Life seems so rosy in the cradle
But I'll be a friend I'll tell you what's in store
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore

Tycoons and barrow boys will rob you
And throw you on the side
And all because they love themselves sincerely
And the man holds a bread knife
Up to you throat is four feet wide
And he's anxious just to show you what it's for

Your mother works so hard to make you happy
But take a look outside the nursery door
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore

And all the sad and empty faces
That pass you on the street
All running in their sleep, all in a dream
Every loving handshake
Is just another man to beat
How your heart aches just to cut him to the core

Life seems so rosy in the cradle
But I'll be a friend I'll tell you what's in store
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow
There's nothing to grow up for anymore

// Together Again //

Together again my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters now we're together again

Together again the grey skies're gone
You're back in my arms now where you belong
The love that I knew is living again
And nothing else matters now we're together again
And nothing else matters now we're together again
