Bulloc sterteth, bucke verteth
Merye sing cuckou!

Cuckou, cuckou

// King Henry V's Conquest Of France //

King Henry lay upon his bed
Lay musing on a tribute due
A tribute due from the King of France
That hadn't been paid for so long a day
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

Oh the King he called for his lovely page
His lovely page then he called he
Saying "You must go to the King of France
To the King of France ride speedily"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

And then away went this lovely page
This lovely page then away went he
And when he came to the King of France
Low he fell down and bending knee
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

"Oh my master greets you worthy sir
Ten tons of gold that is due to he
That you will send him as tribute home
Or in French land you will soon him see"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

"Oh your master's young and of tender years
Not fitter to come into my degree
And I will send him three tennis balls
That with them he may learn to play"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

Oh the page he returned to the English court
"What news, what news?" cried King Henry
"Such news as I'm afraid to speak
For with this news you'll never agree"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

He says "You are young and of tender years
Not fitter to come into his degree
And he will send you three tennis balls
That with them you may learn to play"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

Then Henry writes to the King of France
His pen never flew so speedily
Said "I will toss you some London balls
That'll shake your courts so grievously"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

And then we marched into French land
With drums and trumps so merrily
And bespeaks the King of France
"Yonder comes proud King Henry"
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

Oh the first shot that the Frenchman gave
They killed our English men so free
We killed ten thousand of the French
The rest of them they all ran away
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day
Fa-la, dre-la, da-la, fa-la-la-day

// When I Am Laid In Earth //

When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create
No trouble, no trouble in thy breast
When I am laid, am laid in earth, may my wrongs create
No trouble, no trouble in, in thy breast
Remember me, remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, remember me, but ah!
Forget my fate
Remember me, ah!
Forget my fate
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, mmm, mmm

// So Ben Mi Ca Bon Tempo //

Al so ma basta mo'
Al so ma basta mo'
Fa la la la la la, la la la la la

So ben ch'è favorito
Fa la la la, la la la la la la la
Ahime, no'l posso dir
Ahime. no'l posso dir
Fa la la la la la, la la la la la

O s'io potessi dire
O s'io potessi dire
Fa la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Chi va, chi sta, chi vien
Chi va, chi sta, chi vien
Fa la la la la la, la la la la la

La ti darà martello
La ti darà martello
Fa la la la, la la la la la la la
Per farti disperar
Per farti disperar
Fa la la la la la, la la la la la

So ben mi c'ha bon tempo
So ben mi c'ha bon tempo
Fa la la la, la la la la la la la la la
Al so ma basta mo'
Al so ma basta mo'

Thank you. And the percussionist, Michael Jerome!

// Shenandoah //

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away, you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, to cross the ocean
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
Away you rollin' river
Oh Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you
Away, I must away
Across the wide Missouri

Thank you

// Blackleg Miner //

Oh it's in the evening after dark
That the blackleg miner goes to work
With his moleskin pants and his dirty shirt
There goes the blackleg miner

He takes his pick and down he goes
To hew the coal that lies below
There's not a woman in this town row
Would look at the blackleg miner

Oh Delaval is a terrible place
They rub wet clay in the blackleg's face
Around the pit they run a footrace
To catch the blackleg miner

It's in the evening after dark
The blackleg miner goes to work
With his moleskin pants and his dirty shirt
There goes the blackleg miner

Don't go near the Seghill mine
Across the top they've stretched a line
To catch the throat and break the spine
Of the dirty blackleg miner

It's in the evening after dark
The blackleg miner goes to work
With his moleskin pants and his dirty shirt
There goes the blackleg miner

They take his pick and [?] as well
They hurl them down the pit of hell
It's off you go and fare thee well
You dirty blackleg miner

So join the union while you may
Don't wait till your dying day
For that may not be far away
You dirty blackleg miner

It's in the evening after dark
The blackleg miner goes to work
With his moleskin pants and his dirty shirt
There goes the blackleg miner
It's in the evening after dark
The blackleg miner goes to work
With his moleskin pants and his dirty shirt
There goes the blackleg miner

// Waiting At The Church //

I'm in a nice bit of trouble, I confess
Somebody with me has had a game

I should mention this is sung from the woman's point of view
So um—

I should by now be a proud and happy bride
But I've still got to keep my single name
I was proposed to by Obadiah Binks
In a very gentlemanly way
I lent him all my money so that he could buy a home
And punctually at twelve o'clock today

There was I, waiting at the church
Waiting at the church, waiting at the church
When I found he'd left me in the lurch
Lord, how it did upset me!
All at once, round there comes a note
Here's the very note, this is what he wrote
"I can't get away to marry you today
My wife won't let me!"

Lord, what a fuss Obadiah made of me
When he used to take me to the park
He used to squeeze me till I was black and blue
When he kissed me he used to leave a mark
Each time he met me he treated me to port
And took me now and then to see the play
Now understand me rightly when I say he treated me
It wasn't him but me that used to pay

And there was I, waiting at the church
Waiting at the church, waiting at the church
When I found he'd left me in the lurch
Lord, how it did upset me!
All at once, round there comes a note
Here's the very note, this is what he wrote
"I can't get away to marry you today
My wife won't let me!"

Just think how disappointed I must feel
I'll be off my crumpet very soon
I've lost my husband—the one I never had
And I dreamed so about the honeymoon
I'm looking out for another Obadiah
I've already bought the wedding ring
There's all my little fal-the-riddles packed up in my box
Yes, absolutely two of everything

But there was I, waiting at the church
Waiting at the church, waiting at the church
When I found he'd left me in the lurch
Lord, how it did upset me!
All at once, round there comes a note
Here's the very note, this is what he wrote
"I can't get away to marry you today
My wife won't let me!"
"Oh I can't get away to marry you today
My wife won't let me!"

// Trafalgar Square //

Today I've been busy removing
I'm all of a fidgety-fidge
My last digs were on The Embankment
The third seat from Waterloo Bridge
But the cooking and oh the attendance
Didn't happen to suit me so well
So I ordered my man to pack up and
Look out for another hotel
He did and the new place is extra I vow
Just wait till I tell you where I'm staying now

I live in Trafalgar Square
Four lions to guard me
Fountains and statues all over the place
The Metropole staring me right in the face
I'll admit it's a trifle draughty
But I look at it this way, you see
If it's good enough for Nelson
It's quite good enough for me

Now the beds ain't so soft as they might be
Still the temperature's never too high
And it's nice to see swells who are passing
Look on you with envious eye
And when you wake up in the morning
What nicer thing could there be
Than to have a good walk for your breakfast
And the same for your dinner and tea?
Oh there's many a swell up in Park Lane tonight
Who'd be glad if he only had my appetite

I live in Trafalgar Square
Four lions to guard me
Fountains and statues all over the place
The Metropole staring me right in the face
I'll admit it's a trifle draughty
But I look at it this way, you see
If it's good enough for Nelson
Oh it's quite good enough for me
If it's good enough for Nelson
Oh it's quite good enough for me

// There Is Beauty... //

There is beauty in the bellow of the blast
There is grandeur in the growling of the gale
There is eloquent outpouring
When the lion is a-roaring
And the tiger is a-lashing of his tail

Yes, I like to see a tiger
From the Congo or the Niger
And especially when lashing of his tail

Volcanoes have a splendour that is grim
And earthquakes only terrify the dolts
But to him who's scientific
There's nothing that's terrific
In the falling of a flight of thunderbolts

Yes, in spite of all my meekness
If I have a little weakness
It's a passion for a flight of thunderbolts

If that is so
Sing derry down derry
It's evident, very
Our tastes are one
Away we'll go
And merrily marry
Nor tardily tarry
Till the day is done

There is beauty in extreme old age—
Do you fancy you are elderly enough?
Information I'm requesting
On a subject interesting
Is a maiden all the better when she's tough?

Throughout this wide dominion
It's the general opinion
That she'll last a good deal longer when she's tough

Are you old enough to marry, do you think?
Won't you wait until you're eighty in the shade?
There's a fascination frantic
In a ruin that's romantic
Do you think you are sufficiently decayed?

And to the matter that you mention
I have given some attention
And I think I am sufficiently decayed

If that is so
Sing derry down derry
It's evident, very
Our tastes are one
Away we'll go
And merrily marry
Nor tardily tarry
Till the day is done
If that is so
Sing derry down derry
It's evident, very
Our tastes are one
Away we'll go
And merrily marry
Nor tardily tarry
Till the day is done
Sing derry down derry
We'll merrily marry
Nor tardily tarry
Till the day is done!

// Why Have My Loved Ones Gone? //

Tell me why have my loved ones gone
Like dew 'neath the early sun?
Why am I left all alone
While all their troubles here are gone?
My days of youth have passed away
And the shades of life are near
But still I remain to mourn the happy days
Where dear departed friends were here

Tell me why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?

Tell me why have my loved ones gone
While springtime is on the breeze?
Gilding the hillside farm
And breathing music through the trees
The birds are singing in the air
And the flowers are in their bloom
All things around are beautiful and fair
But still my spirit lies in gloom

Tell me why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?
Why have my loved ones gone?
Gone to return no more
Calmly gliding o'er a summer sea
While I'm left plodding on the shore?

I've got a favorite version of this at home. A duet between Hoagy Carmichael and Louis Armstrong which is about as good as it gets.

// Old Rocking Chair's Got Me //

Old rockin' chair's got me
Cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son
'Fore I tan your hide
I can't leave this cabin
I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm sittin' here grabbin'
Flies 'round this rockin' chair
Oh sweet aunt Harriet
How long in Heaven you be?
Send out a sweet chariot
For an end of the troubles I've seen
Old rockin' chair's got it
Ain't goin' nowhere
Trapped in my rockin' chair

Oh sweet aunt Harriet
How long in Heaven you be?
Send out a sweet chariot
For an end of the troubles I've seen
Mmm, old rockin' chair's got me
I'm goin' nowhere
Trapped in my rockin' chair
Trapped in my rockin' chair

// Orange-Coloured Sky //

I was walking along minding my business
When out of an orange-colored sky
Flash, crash, alakazam
Wonderful you walked by

I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange-colored view
Flash, crash, alakazam
I got a look at you

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
This is it, this is it, this is it
I've been hit!

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, crash, alakazam
Out of an orange-colored sky

One look and I yelled timber
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
This is it, this is it, this is it
I've been hit!

I was walking along minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Flash, crash, alakazam
Out of an orange-colored, candy-striped
Fruity green polka-dot sky
Flash, crash, alakazam
And goodbye

I never knew love was so loud when it's really disturbing noise
