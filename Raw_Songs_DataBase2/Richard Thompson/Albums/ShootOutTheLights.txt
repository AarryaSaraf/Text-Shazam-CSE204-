// Don't Renege On Our Love //

Remember when we were hand in hand
Remember we sealed it with a golden band
Now your eyes don't meet mine, you've got a pulse like fever
Do I take you for a lover or just a deceiver?
Simple is simple and plain is plain
If you leave me now you won't come back again
When the game is up, ah don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love
Ah no, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

Well give me just an ounce of sympathy
Give me my chains of liberty
There's a rope that binds us and I don't want to break it
If love is a healing why should we forsake it
Well hunger is hunger and need is need
Am I just another mouth to feed
When the game is up, well don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love

When my heart breaks it breaks like the weather
If you leave me now it'll thunder forever
Oh, don't give it up. Well, well, don't renege on our love
Ah no, don't renege on our love
No, don't renege on our love, don't renege on our love
Don't renege on our love

// Walking On A Wire //

I hand you my ball and chain
You just hand me that same old refrain
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

I wish I could please you tonight
But my medicine just won't come right
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

Too many steps to take
Too many spells to break
Too many nights awake
And no one else
This grindstone's wearing me
Your claws are tearing me
Don't use me endlessly
It's too long, too long to myself

Where's the justice and where's the sense?
When all the pain is on my side of the fence
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

Too many steps to take
Too many spells to break
Too many nights awake
And no one else
This grindstone's wearing me
Your claws are tearing me
Don't use me endlessly
It's too long, it's too long to myself

It scares you when you don't know
Whichever way the wind might blow
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling
I'm walking on a wire, I'm walking on a wire
And I'm falling

// A Man In Need //

I packed my rags, went down the hill
Left my dependents a-lying still
Just as the dawn was rising up
I was making good speed
I left a letter lying on the bed
From a man in need, it read

You know it's so hard, It's so hard to find
Well, well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

All of my friends don't comprehend me
Their kind of style it just offends me
I want to take 'em, I want to shake 'em
Till they pay me some heed
Oh, you've got to ride in one direction
Until you find the right connection

You know it's so hard, so, so, so, so
Well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

Who's going to give you real happiness?
Who's going to give you contentedness?
Who's going to lead you? Who's going to feed you?
And cut you free?
Well I've sailed every ship in the sea
But I travelled this world in misery

You know it's so hard, so hard, so hard
Well, well. Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?

Well who's going to shoe your feet?
Ah who's going to pay your rent?
And who's going to stand by you?
Well, well, well, well
Who's going to cure the heart of a man in need?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Of a man in need

// Just The Motion //

When you're rocked on the ocean, rocked up and down, don't worry
When you're spinning and turning round and around, don't worry
You're just feeling sea-sick, you're just feeling weak
Your mind is confused and you can't seem to speak
It's just the motion, it's just the motion

When the landlord is knocking and your job is losing, don't worry
And the baby needs rocking and your friends are confusing, don't worry
You're just feeling sea-sick, you're just feeling weak
Your mind is confused and you can't seem to speak
Oh, it's just the motion, it's just the motion

Blown by a hundred winds, knocked down a hundred times
Rescued and carried along. Beaten and half-dead and gone
And it's only the pain that's keeping you sane
And gives you a mind to travel on

Oh the motion won't leave you, won't let you remain, don't worry
It's a restless wind and a sleepless rain, don't worry
'Cause under the ocean at the bottom of the sea
You can't hear the storm, it's as peaceful as can be
It's just the motion, it's just the motion

Blown by a hundred winds, knocked down a hundred times
Rescued and carried along. Beaten and half-dead and gone
And it's only the pain that's keeping you sane
And gives you a mind to travel on

Oh the motion won't leave you, won't let you remain, don't worry
It's a restless wind and a sleepless rain, don't worry
'Cause under the ocean at the bottom of the sea
You can't hear the storm, it's as peaceful as can be
It's just the motion, it's just the motion
It's just the motion, it's just the motion

// Shoot Out The Lights //

In the dark, who can see his face?
In the dark, who can reach him?
He hides like a child
He hides like a child
Keeps his finger on the trigger
You know he can't stand the day
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights

Keep the blind down on the window
Ah, keep the pain on the inside
Just watching the dark
Just watching the dark
Ah he might laugh but you won't see him
As he thunders through the night
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights

In the darkness the shadows move
In the darkness the game is real
Real as a gun
Real as a gun
As he watches the lights of the city
And he moves through the night
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights
Ah, shoot out the lights

// Back Street Slide //

Those backstreet women, watch what you say
You turn your back and they slide away
They run next door, they give it all away
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Gatemouth woman leaning on the fence
She's got no teeth, she's got no sense
You don't need much intelligence
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

Slide over here, slide over there
Spreading that scandal everywhere
Stab you in the back and they just don't care
Doing the slide

Now slander is a loving tongue
They speak your name to everyone
Never is a curse left unsung
Doing the slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

The backstreet slide, the backstreet slide
They're gonna get you, dead or alive
Stab you in the back with a kitchen knife
Doing the backstreet slide
Do it all day, the backstreet slide

// Did She Jump Or Was She Pushed //

She was there one minute
And then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself
With a twisted neck

Oh she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life
She used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance
The chosen would dance in attendance

She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed

Oh, she used to have style
She used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad
When the truth came 'round and she refused it

They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note

Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Oh, did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed
Did she jump or was she pushed

// Wall Of Death //

Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
Let me ride on the wall of death one more time
You can waste your time on the other rides
But this is the nearest to being alive
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

On the Wall of Death
All the world is far from me
On the Wall of Death
It's the nearest to being free

Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the use of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall of Death

You are going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the use of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Let me take my chances
Let me take my chances
Let me take my chances

// Living In Luxury //

I don't have no credit
And I don't know where to get it
I don't know where to get it
And it's all the same to me

You don't miss your shilling
When you got someone who's willing
Because loving is living in luxury

Rocks in my bed and two crusts of bread
Two crusts of bread ain't the feast it used to be
Rocks in my head but I've got love instead
Because loving is living in luxury

You don't look so clever
When you put it all together
You put it all together
And there ain't much to see

You don't need a thing
To live just like a king
Because loving is living in luxury
Loving is living in luxury
Loving is living in luxury
