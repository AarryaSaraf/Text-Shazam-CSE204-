// Fool For Your Love //

What do you want, baby
One last piece of my heart
What do you need, baby
We could make a new start

I'm not scared
All the nights alone
Lying there crying with the television on
Watching those scoops about love and happiness
Wonder what I ever did to deserve a fate like this

I don't wanna be around
For that famous final scene
I just can't help myself
I'm a fool for your love

Leave me alone, please
My heart can't take any more
You left me going crazy
It started just like a phone

You're the number one
You're the only one I need
If you don't want my love
Then set me free

I don't wanna be around
For that famous final scene
I can't help myself
I'm a fool for your love

Don't come closer
You know I'm easy to phone
You don't love me
Any fool can see
I'm telling you goodbye
Bye, bye

Leave me alone, please
My heart can't take anymore
Leave me alone, please
Let me walk out that door
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone

I don't wanna be around
For that famous final scene
I just can't help myself
I'm a fool for your love

I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone
A fool for your love
I'm a fool for your love
Leave me alone, please
My heart can't take it no more
Leave me alone, leave me alone

// Backstabbers //

(What they do! )
Smile in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

I say, they smile in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

Everybody who really have someone
And if you really, really care
Then I'm telling everybody
That you've gotta beware, yeah

Somebody's out to take your baby
And a few of your best friends
They sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
Aimin' straight at your back
I just don't think they'll miss

(What they do! )
They keep smiling in your face
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

A house fully of visitors
Always around, calling themselves my friends
Oh, they keep coming around
Time and time and time and time again

I know they're trying to take my baby
Even though I'd never home
They just keep on comin'
What can I do to get them on the right track
Oh, I wish they'd take some of these knives off my back

(What they did!) (Do, do)
They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

(What they did!) (Do, do)
They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place
(Back stabbers)

Talking about Back Stabbers
(Smile in my face all the time)
I know they just wanna take my place
(Back stabbers)

(They just keep smiling in my face)
Two faces, mornin'
They just want to take my place

They Keep smiling
(They keep smiling in my face
All the time they want to take my place)
All the time!
They just wanna take my place...

Ohhh, yeah

// Just A Little Lovin' (Early In The Morning) //

Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
Beats a cup of coffee
For starting off the day

Just a little lovin'
When the world is yawnin'
Makes you feel wake up feeling
Good things are coming your way

This old world
Wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had, yeah

Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
That little extra somethin'
To kinda see them through

Nothing turns the day on
Really gets it dawnin'
Like a little bit of lovin'
From some lovin' someone like you

This old world
Wouldn't be half as bad
It wouldn't be half as sad
If each and everybody in it had

Just a little lovin'
Early in the mornin'
(Just a little lovin')
(When the world is yawnin')

Just a little bit of lovin' ah
Oh, in the morning
Nothing turns the day on
Really gets it dawnin'
Make a little bit of lovin'
It's so good, it's so good

// You Got What I'm Gonna Get //

Did you know
Fire is my middle name
Did you know
You're the flame
Feel it grow
Oh baby

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way

One thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
Get ready and get set
You got what I'm gonna get
Oh, you got what I'm gonna get

When we touch
Lord I shiver through and through
I could die from wanting you
Stay with me
Oh baby

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way

And let me tell you that one thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
Get ready and get set
You got what I'm gonna get

Would you turn your back on thunder
I wouldn't turn away from you
Just between us don't you wonder
Oh what the heck my love can do
'Cause

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way, ye, ye, ye

One thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
So get ready and get set
Hey baby

You got what I'm gonna get...
