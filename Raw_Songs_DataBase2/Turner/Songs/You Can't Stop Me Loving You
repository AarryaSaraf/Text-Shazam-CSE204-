You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You know I love you baby
Why do you treat me this way
I don't deserve this kind of treatment
And I'd have been so good like a lover should
And I'd have loved you anyway, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You're going to drive me crazy honey
Why are you so blind?
Cool, and I think you are so cool now baby
But you just can't see
All the loving me when I give you all the time

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

Oh I know I am going to be fine
You ain't going to pull my chain
I ain't going to change my mind

How do you feel baby?
I bet you feel real tall
Why did you leave your man, huh honey?
When I give you love and it's not enough
You try to make me look small

You can run and you can hide
You can tell me you're untrue
You can play around with my feelings
Say you found somebody new
But there's one thing you can't do
You can't stop me loving you

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do

You can't stop me loving you
You can't stop me loving you
No matter what you do
