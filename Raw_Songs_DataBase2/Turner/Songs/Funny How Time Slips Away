Well hello there
My, it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long since I've seen you

It seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I guess she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you would love her 'til the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me

It seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I got to go now
But I guess I'll see you somewhere around
I don't know when though, oh
Because I never know when I'll be back in town
Please remember what I told you
Well I just want to say

That it's so funny
How time slips away
That it's so funny
How time slips away

Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
