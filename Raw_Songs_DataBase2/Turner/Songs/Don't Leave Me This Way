All of my life, all of my life
I've been searching for a love like ours
Somewhere to stay, somewhere safe
In your arms, I was so sure

Are you really saying your heart's changing
Do you really mean goodbye

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Say what's on your mind, one thing at a time
And I promise you we'll talk it through
Don't walk away, there's so much more to say
Though my words seem lost on you
Can't believe you're talking like we're just friends
Can't you see the tears I cry?

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Are you really saying your heart's changing
Do you really mean goodbye

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way 

Don't leave me this way, no, no
Don't tell me it's over
We've only begun and our love is so young
You're leading me nowhere
Don't leave me this way 
Don't leave me this way
