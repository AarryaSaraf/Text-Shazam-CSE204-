Did you know
Fire is my middle name
Did you know
You're the flame
Feel it grow
Oh baby

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way

One thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
Get ready and get set
You got what I'm gonna get
Oh, you got what I'm gonna get

When we touch
Lord I shiver through and through
I could die from wanting you
Stay with me
Oh baby

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way

And let me tell you that one thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
Get ready and get set
You got what I'm gonna get

Would you turn your back on thunder
I wouldn't turn away from you
Just between us don't you wonder
Oh what the heck my love can do
'Cause

You've got what I'm gonna get
You've got what I'm gonna get
I'm hot oh and you can bet
I'm gonna get my way, ye, ye, ye

One thought flashes through my mind
I'm not leaving you behind
You got what I have to find
So get ready and get set
Hey baby

You got what I'm gonna get...
