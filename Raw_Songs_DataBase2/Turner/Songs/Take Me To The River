Wash me!

I don't know why I love you like I do
With all the changes I keep going through
Lost all my money and my happiness
And I haven't had the worst of it yet
I wanna know, tell me, tell me why
I love it still

Take me to the river
Wash me down
Yeah, drop me in the water
Back to my fishing ground

And I don't know why they treat me so bad
Think of all the good things that I've never had
Love is an ocean I won't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I wanna know, won't you tell me, tell me why
I love it still

C'mon, river
Wet me down
Yeah, dip me in the water
Back to my fishing ground

And hold me, squeeze me
Just love me, and tease me
Till I can't, till I can't
Take it no more

I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the good things that I've never had
Love's an ocean I won't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret
I wanna know, you tell me, tell me why
I love it still

Take me to the river
And dip me in the water
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Yeah take me to the water
My fishing ground
Wash me, wet me
Squeeze me, and tease me

Washing me down
