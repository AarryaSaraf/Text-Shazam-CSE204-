He's got money
He's got lovin'
But there's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

He wears 
And he 
But there's you that's got a hold on me
I can't stop rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

I got a fever
It's about 102
But there's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

I got rhythm
I'm gonna give it to you
'Cause there's just you that's got a hold on me
It's got me rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'

Rockin' and rollin'
Steppin' and strollin'
It's you that's got a hold on me
And I'm rockin' and rollin', rollin'
