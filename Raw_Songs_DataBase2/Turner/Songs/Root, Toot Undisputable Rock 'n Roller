When you walk into the bar
I'm the first one you're gonna see
Business and pleasure just don't mix
So can I take your order please
You fellas know I don't take no mess
It's a whole lotta woman in this dress

They call me the
Root, toot undisputable Rock and Roller
I gotta fine fanny but a rough talking Annie
Rock and Roller

Every time the jukebox plays
I get out on the floor
Trouble maker come my way
And I'll gladly show him the door
Everybody knows to keep it cool
Cause I'm fresh out of karate school

They call me the
Root, toot undisputable Rock and Roller
I gotta fine fanny but a rough talking Annie
Rock and Roller

Ahhh the root, toot undisputable...
