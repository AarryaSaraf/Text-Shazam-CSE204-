Baby
Baby
Baby

I know that I've been mad in love before
But how I can be with you

You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've gotten so much more

Baby
Baby

The curiousness of your potential kiss
Has got my mind and body aching

You really hurt me baby, you really cut me baby
How could you have a day without a night
You're the book that I have opened
And now I've gotten so much more

Oh yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part

Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
And I'm every missing every part

You really hurt me, baby
You really hurt me, baby
Like a soul without a mind in a body without a heart
I'm every missing every part
