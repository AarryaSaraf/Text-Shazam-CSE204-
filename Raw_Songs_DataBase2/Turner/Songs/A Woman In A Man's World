He's always right, I'm always wrong
Because he's weak I must be strong

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world

I say it's white, he says it's black
When he runs away I take him back

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
To love a man in a man's world

But if I use my head
Instead of my heart
I'll find someone is to kill for 
Because there's just no use
In trying to be smart
Because I know I'd only learn
To love him more

The more I give, the more he takes
I live inside the world he makes

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world

That's the way it is
That's just the way it is
When you're a woman in a man's world
