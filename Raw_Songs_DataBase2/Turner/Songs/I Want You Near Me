Should you stay should you go
Hmm you're beginning to see
I blow hot I blow cold
Oh it's just the devil in me
You got to understand I am
In love with a beautiful man
So if you're feeling insecure
You've really got no cause to be

I want you near me
Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down

You're so good with your hands
To help me with a hook or zip
Indispensable that's what you are
Hmm for the occasional kiss
I'm only playing games with you
I can't be nice without being cruel
I know it's unfair but I make the rules

I want you near me
Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down

All I want I've decided
Is your attention
Undivided

I want you near me
Don't turn away
Just got used to having you around
I want you near me
Come on here and stay
Don't let me down
