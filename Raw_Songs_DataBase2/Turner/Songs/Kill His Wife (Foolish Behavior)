Can I introduce myself
I'm a girl of financial wealth
Sound in mind, body, soul and health
And I wanna kill his wife
I have this urge to take a life

Took twenty-four years to get rid of her
Not divorce I really do mean to kill her
She's so full of useless information and trivia
That's why I wanna kill his wife
I really wanna take a life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

Her stupid friends get right up my nose
They wear annoyingly sensible clothes
They're also bleeding grandiose
You know I what, I should kill her friends
They're all driving Mercedes Benz

Should I strangle her in bed
Suffocate that little venomous head
Or shall I hang her up, leave her for death
Do me a favor, kill his wife

Do it mankind to change her life
Should I act quiet, cold and deliberate
Or maybe blow out her brain with a bullet
And they'll say suicide they won't know who done it
And I wanna kill his wife
I really wanna take a life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

The moment of truth has come
I'm at the point of no return
I've got my hands wrapped round the noose
And I'm about to kill his wife
Don't stop me now I'm gonna kill his wife
Too late now I'm gonna kill his wife
Can't help myself I'm gonna take her life

He'll escape down into Mexico
(Baby, to Mexico)
Sell the house and find a nice young girl
(Find a nice young girl)
Just so life won't hurt no more

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
