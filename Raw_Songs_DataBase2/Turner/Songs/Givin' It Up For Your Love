I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now
I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now

My heart is aching for you
I can't stand it
I need your lovin'
And my soul demands it

I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now

I thought about it
And I ain't playing
Won't you listen to me
Every word I'm saying
Hot is cold honey, and cold is hot
And I'm a little mixed up
But I give it everything I've got

I want your money, baby
I want your car
I say I'm doing all right
Doing all right so far

I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
I'm givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now

I know you told me
That you love me
And I believe that is true
Well I saved the best and I'm grateful
My love only just for you
I said come back here, come back real quick
My heart is aching
And my body's feeling weak
I'll be alright
I said, baby I'll be OK
Come on now, honey
Listen to what I say

I want your money, baby
I want your car
I say I'm doing all right
Doing all right so far

Givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right now
Don't you know I'm givin' it up for your love
Everything
Givin' it up for your love
Right
