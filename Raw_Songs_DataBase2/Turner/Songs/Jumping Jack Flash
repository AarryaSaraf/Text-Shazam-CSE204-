I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my mom in the drivin' rain
But it's all right, oh yeah
In fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right
Said Jumpin' Jack
Gas! Gas! Gas!

I was raised by a toothless, skinny hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right, oh yeah
In fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right
Said Jumpin' Jack
Gas! Gas! Gas!

I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
Said I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do

I like it, I said I like it, ooh, I like it, I said I like it
Ooh, I like it, ooh yeah, I like it, I said I like it, ooh yeah, I like it

I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it
I know it's only rock 'n roll, but I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, like it, yes, I do
I like it, like it, yes, I do
