Hey you! You too!
I could make the choice for you
Dirt sticks close to you - it's all around me
Everything I try to do
I can't even seem to find the room to move

But you think you're number one
Actors though the film has gone
Crowded in a room for one
Darkness when the lights are on
Turn me on for good - it's so exciting
Slogans on the wall don't need no advertising
I can't even seem to find the room to move

Shackled up in fantasy
Hoping for some time to breathe
Suffocation comes too easy
I just want some time to breathe
Dirt sticks close to you - it's all around me
Everything I do - they're always trying to crowd me
I can't even seem to find the room to move

Watching every move I make
Choice of one that's hard to take
In fact it's just a big mistake
The effects that make it feel like you
Maggots run inside the line
Ready for the perfect crime
Say there is no right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong
I don't know what's right or wrong
