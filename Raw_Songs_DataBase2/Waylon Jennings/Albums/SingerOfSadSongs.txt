// Singer Of Sad Songs //

Widow Jones couldn't make it on her own
Frank was 'lectrafied leaving six kids half grown
In her misery she sent for me the singer of sad songs
And I sympathized and eulogized Frank Jones.

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts I'll wash your clothes
And mend your socks for your pay.

Farmer Brown had always dreamed of city lights
Mini skirts on pretty girls were in his sights
So one early morn he left his corn to harvest a field of sin
Mrs. Brown called me shortly after three a.m..

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts got some
Early hybrid corn for your pay.

Lovely Lucy sat there sippin' a glass of wine
She was at the church waitin' till after nine
But the groom to be was somewhere free with a case of yellow spine.
Lovely Lucy she's still a virgin and that's a crime.

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts got a
Slightly used diamond for your pay...

// Sick And Tired //

Oh baby, tell me what you gonna do
Oh baby, tell me what you gonna do
I'm sick and tired
From foolin' round with you.

Get up every morning pick up somethin' to eat
I'm gonna go to work and you brush your teeth
Come home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got a rag tied round your head.

Oh baby, tell me what you're gonna do
I'm sick and tired a foolin' round with you.

It's the last time I'm tellin' you
Better change your ways
Last time I'm tellin' you
I mean what to say.

Last time I'm tellin' you you better stop to try
You're gonna find yourself outside
Oh baby, tell me what you're gonna do
I'm sick and tired from fooin' round with you.

// Time Between Bottles And Wine //

With iron in my brain I'd laid down to rest
Not carin' if I live or die
Woke up a freezin' with rain pourin' down
So hard I can't open my eyes.

I been chased from the yard with dogs at my heels
Searchin' for shelter at times
But there's nothing so hard for a man on the bum
As the time between bottles of wine.
The time between bottles of wine.

Beggin' for pennies just one sweet taste
Of the nectar that kills the man's soul
Sweet piece of mind excuses my pride
Just somethin' that keep out the cold.

It's too late for me to start living again
The good life is too far behind
I never remembere the things that I've had
Till the time between bottles of wine.
The time between bottles of wine.

If mama could see me she wouldn't believe
I even resemble her son
She would throw her life to make me a man
And she's proud the child that she's done.

What one love created another destroyed
The story is older than time
The tale of a man who just can't stand
The time between bottles of wine.

The time between bottles of wine.
The time between bottles of wine.
The time between bottles of wine...

// Must You Throw Dirt In My Face //

What is it that brings you to this part of town
Curiosity, conscience or fate
I know it's not love for I once gave you love
And all you gave me was the gate.

I got a feeling you've come back to just rub it in
And it really put me in my place
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Why must you throw dirt in my face?

Must you keep telling me you've got a new love
I don't need you to remind me
Must you keep telling me I look so lonesome
And that my better days are behind me.

Must you keep showing me pictures of him
And boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?

You've already left me and broken my heart
Told me how much you don't want me
Believe I'm happier when we're apart
Why must you come back now and haunt me?

Must you keep showing me pictures of him
And boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?

You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?...

// No Regrets //

I know your leaving's too long overdue
For too long I've had nothing new to show you
Goodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone.

No regrets, no tears, goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again.

[Instrumental]

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The toughts we used to share I now keep alone
I awoke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone.

No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again.

[Instrumental]

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghost away
Just beayond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
It feels so strange to leave my life alone.

No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again...

// Ragged But Right //

Well, I've come here to tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a rounder
I stay out late at night.

I pour a high steak
Three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer
In this old town can afford.

A big electric fan
Keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy
Play's around daddy's feet.

I'm a rounder, I'm a gambler
Lord, I lead every fight
I tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right.

[Instrumental]

When I got married
I knew I'd settled down
I built a little lovenest
Right near in my hometown.

Now, I've got a family
One that I'm proud of
I know that they'll be happy
'Cause I'm the one they love.

A big electric fan
Keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy
Play's around daddy's feet.

I'm a rounder, I'm a gambler
Lord, I lead every fight
I tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right...

// Honky Tonk Women //

I met her, just a barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to make me upstairs for a ride
She had to carry me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink her off of my mind
She's a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl.

I met her either say in New York City
I had to put up a one heck of a fight
The lady said she'd covered me with roses
She broke my nose and then she broke my mind.
She's a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl.

[Instrumental]

She's a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl.

She's a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl.

She's a honky tonk woman
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme the honky tonk girl...

// She Comes Running //

When loneliness is knocking at my mind
Happiness is something I can't find
Pleasure seem forty miles behind
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

If I stand in someone else's rain
Feelin' forty million miles of pain
She know just what and who's to blame
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

If my dreams all turn to seas
If my flowers turn to breeze
She knows exactly what I need
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

On the day the world puts me down
In some empty space in the ground
I'll bet if I make a sound
She'll come running...

// If I Were A Carpenter //

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If a thinker were my trade would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made following behind me.

Save my love through sorrow
Save your love through lonely
You can have my tomorrow
Just love me only.

[Instrumental]

If I worked my hands in wood would you still love me
Answer me say yes I would I place you above me
If I were a miller with a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your pretty clothes and your soft shoes shining?

Save my love through sorrow
Save your love through lonely
You can have my tomorrow
Just love me only.

[Instrumental]

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby?...

// Donna On My Mind //

Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning,
Donna on my mind the whole day through,
love can't come so quick and real without any warning wonder if she's thinking of me too. 

Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,
now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,
'till then I'll just have Donna on my mind. 

Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,
now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,
'till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.

// Rock, Salt And Nails //

By the banks of the river where the willows grow cold
Wild birds warble the strange soundin' song
By the banks of the river where the waters run cold
Well that's where I first listened the lies that she told.

He lays there each night all alone and he weeps
Nothing ain't worse than a night without sleep
The letters she wrote him they were written in vain
But I know that her conscience still echoes my name.

If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were fishes
I'd lay there for hours in the cold rainy matches
If the ladies were squirrels yeah with a big bushy tail
I'd fill up my shotgun with a rock salt and nails.

We'd fill up our shotgun with a rock salt and nails...
