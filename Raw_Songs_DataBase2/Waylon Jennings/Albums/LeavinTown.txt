Album: LeavinTown

// Leavin' Town //

There she goes again see her smiling
So happy with the new love that she's found
See her whisper in my ear
All those things I used to hear.

Oh, how that hurts me so I'm leavin' town
She's the reason why I'm leavin' town
I'm going far away where no one knows me
When morning comes well, I won't be around.

To see her whisper in his ear
Kiss and call him dear
Oh, I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town
Bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town.

[Instrumental]

I'm going far away where no one knows me
When morning comes well, I won't be around
To see her whisper in his ear
Kiss and call him dear.

Oh, I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town
Packin' up my hurt and leavin' town
Mhm, leavin' town
Bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town...

// Time To Bum Again //

Woman you get meaner every day
And your naggin' is hard to stand
So I'll pack my things and I'll be on my way
'Cause it's time to bum again.

This house gets smaller with every day
And the walls are closin' in
I guess I've said all there is to say
And it's time to bum again.

The time has come to bum again
I'm gonna see all the places I ain't been
Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again.

[Instrumental]

I'll visit my buddy out in Bakersfield
We soldiered together years back
We'll talk night and day till there's no more to say
Then I'll head on down the track.

I may come back in a year or two
And you may not desire me then
There are some things that a man must do
And it's time to bum again.

The time has come to bum again
I'm gonna see all the places I ain't been
Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again.

Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again...

// If You Really Want Me To I'll Go //

If you really want me to, I'll go
It's not that I want to, but I'll go
If you've found somebody who could love you more than me
If you really want me to, I'll go.

I don't know just what you're tryin' to do
You told me that your love for me was true
I don't understand my love, please tell me what to do
If you really want me to, I'll go.

I need you more than you know
Ask me to do anything but go
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.

Don't tell me that it's over
I don't wanna know
If you really want me to
I'll go.

[Instrumental]

I need you more than you know
Ask me to do anything but go
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.

Don't tell me that it's over
I don't wanna know
If you really want me to
I'll go.

If you really want me to, I'll go...

// Baby, Don't Be Looking In My Mind //

Baby don't be looking in my mind
You might not like what you find
For honey, I know you better than you think
I do so baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Don't expect sweet I-love-you's on and on
If I didn't love you I'd be gone
Don't change the way I live just take what I can give
And baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Don't expect my every thought to be of you
For I'm a man and men have things to do
I'm proud to be your man and I love you all I can
But baby, don't be looking in my mind.

[Instrumental]

Don't expect my every thought to be of you
For I'm a man and men have things to do
I'm proud to be your man and I love you all I can
But baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Baby, don't be looking in my mind...

// That's Alright //

I gave my heart, I gave my all
You built me up then you let me fall
You wore my ring upon your hand
But then you changed your mind.

But that's all right I looked around
And found true love.

[Instrumental]

You made me laugh, you made me cry
I wished that day that I could die
You never dreamed that by and by
I'd be glad you changed your mind.

Yes, that's all right I looked around
And found true love...

// Time Will Tell The Story //

It seems I see you everywhere
You and your new lover there
Time will tell the story of your new love
Do you think he'll ever be
The man you've tried to make of me
Time will tell the story of your new love.

The day when he's a used-to-be
He'll be just as blue as me
Losing all that he dreams of
Time is all it takes to tell
The story that I know so well
Time will tell the story of your new love.

[Instrumental]

The day when he's a used-to-be
He'll be just as blue as me
Losing all that he dreams of
Time is all it takes to tell
The story that I know so well
Time will tell the story of your new love.

Time will tell the story of your new love.
Time will tell the story of your new love...

// You're Gonna Wonder About Me //

Pretty soon this old town I'll be leaving
And I'm going just as far as I can go
'Cause ever since you've put me down
I can't stand to stay around this old town
And all the friends we used to know.

And when that old north wind comes a howlin'
And your cold arms long for company
When the moon peeps through the pines
And there's mem'ries on your mind
You're gonna wonder about me, babe
You're gonna wonder about me.

[Instrumental]

Pretty soon you may find that you miss me
But by then I'll be many miles away
I may be in Baltimore with old friends I knew before
I don't know if that's for sure. I can't say

But when that old north wind comes a howlin'
And your cold arms long for company
When the moon peeps through the pines
And there's mem'ries on your mind
You're gonna wonder about me, babe
You're gonna wonder about me.

Babe, you're gonna wonder about me.
You're gonna wonder about me.

Babe, you're gonna wonder about me...

// For Lovin' Me //

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

Don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you but don't be blue
I'll have a thousand before I'm through.

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

[Instrumental]

There you go you're cryin' again
You should have known how things would end
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again.

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

That's what you get for lovin' me...

// Anita, You're Dreaming //

Anita, come closer
Stop crying and listen to me
I guess it's too late now
But somehow I must make you see.
What we thought was our world
Was only a dream world
And we just can't go on like this
Anita, you're dreaming
Of a world that can never exist.

Anita, it's over
There's nothing that's left now to say
Anita, you're dreaming
And I know it's better this way.

[Instrumental]

Anita, come closer
And close your pretty blue eyes
Your young dreams just can't be
And somehow you must realize.
And each time you're with me
My conscience reminds me
Of someone who's waiting alone
Anita, you're dreaming
And when you awake, I'll be gone.

Anita it's over
There's nothing that's left now to say
Anita, you're dreaming
And I know it's better this way...

// Doesn't Anybody Know My Name //

I've been away for so long
Fought a war that's come and gone
Doesn't anybody know my name?
My sister upped and wed
Mom was sick and took to bed
And my old dog Red's gone lame.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four.

This old house is falling down
There ain't no need in me for hanging round
Doesn't anybody know my name?
The girl I left behind
She's gone with this friend of mine
I don't have to see a sign
To know things ain't the same.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four.

You can't get far away
On just a soldier's pay
Doesn't anybody know my name?
Used to be when I could see
Everybody wanted me
Guess nobody cares to see
A blind man catch a train.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four...

// Falling For You //

You bring me happiness then leave me loneliness
My world is in distress yet I keep falling for you
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies
You're a heartbreak in disguise yet I keep falling for you.

Oh darling, when you're near my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear I don't know what to do
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you.

[Instrumental]

Oh darling, when you're near my world is happy, dear
But when you disappear I don't know what to do
I love in misery you're so unfair to me
It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you.

It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you...

// I Wonder Just Where I Went Wrong //

Your love, I'm no longer sure of
Seems there's times you'd rather be alone
And if I'm losing you tell me what did I do
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong.

Even though I still feel the same
I can't help but feel I'm to blame
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong.

[Instrumental]

Even though I still feel the same
I can't help but feel I'm to blame
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong.

Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong...
