// Crying //

I was all right for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight.

When you stopped to say hello
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell that I'd been:

Crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said, So long.
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying.

It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying.

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more
Than I did before.

But darling, what can I do
Oh, you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying over you.

Crying over you.
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying.

I'm crying, crying
Oh, oh, oh over you...

// Sally Was A Good Old Girl //

Sally used to carry my books to school
Sally was a good ole girl
Helped me with my homework 'cause I was a fool
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

If you wanted just a kiss or a little bitty squeeze
She was always willing to do her best to please
Yeah, girls were made to love and not made to tease
Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Oh well, Sally's folks were poor but she helped all she could
Sally was a good ole girl
Hardest working girl in the neighborhood
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, she walked up and down the street all day
Selling neck ties to the one's who'd pay
If they couldn't afford it then she'd give them away
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a favorite with all of the men
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl
All of the ladies despised her then
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, the women talked about her
but Sally didn't care
She kept on a workin' and a doin' her share
She wound up married to a millionare
Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Well, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl...

// Burning Memories //

Tonight I'm burning old love letters
Photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better
And that when the smoke is gone I won't want you.

Burning mem'ries
Teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ries
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose.

My heart to you no longer matters
And I can't live alone with memories
Into the fire those dreams that you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free.

Burning mem'ries
Teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ries
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose...

Tout les soirs et tout les nuits

// Money (That's What I Want) //

The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees
Now give me money
That's what I want

You're lovin' gives me a thrill
But you're lovin' don't pay my bills
Now give me money
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money
That's what I want

Well, now give me money, money
Wow, yeah, I wanna be free
I want money
That's what I want

That's what I want
Now give me money, money
You need money, give me money
That's what I want

That's what I want
...

// It's So Easy //

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

People tell me love's for fools
So here I go breaking all of the rules
Well it's so easy, so dog-on easy
Well it's so easy
Where you're concerned my heart's concerned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

Look into your heart to see
What your love book has set apart for me
Well it's so easy, so dog-on easy
Well it's so easy
Where you're concerned my heart's concerned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love...

// Lorena //

The years creep slowly by, Lorena
The snow is on the grass again
The sun's low down the sky, Lorena
The frost gleams where the flowers have been
But the heart throbs on as warmly now
As when the summer days were nigh
Oh, the sun can never dip so low
A-down affection's cloudless sky.

A hundred months have passed, Lorena
Since last I held that hand in mine
And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena
Though mine beat faster far than thine
A hundred months...'twas flowery May
When up the hilly slope we climbed
To watch the dying of the day
And hear the distant church bells chime.

We loved each other then, Lorena
More than we ever dared to tell
And what we might have been, Lorena
Had but our loving prospered well
But then, 'tis past, the years have gone
I'll not call up their shadowy forms
I'll say to them, "Lost years, sleep on
Sleep on, nor heed life's pelting storms."

The story of the past, Lorena
Alas! I care not to repeat
The hopes that could not last, Lorena
They lived, but only lived to cheat
I would not cause e'en one regret
To rankle in your bosom now
"For if we try we may forget"
Were words of thine long years ago.

Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena
They are within my memory yet
They touched some tender chords, Lorena
Which thrill and tremble with regret
'Twas not the woman's heart which spoke
Thy heart was always true to me
A duty stern and piercing broke
The tie which linked my soul with thee.

It matters little now, Lorena
The past is in the eternal past
Our hearts will soon lie low, Lorena
Life's tide is ebbing out so fast
There is a future, oh, thank God!
Of life this is so small a part
'Tis dust to dust beneath the sod
But there, up there, 'tis heart to heart.

// Love's Gonna Live Here //

Oh the sun's gonna shine, in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Things are gonna be the way they, were before
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness, only happiness
Love's gonna live here again.

I hear bells a-ringin', I hear birds a-singin'
Love's gonna live here again
I hear bee's a-hummin, and I know the days' a-comin'
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness, only happiness
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here again...

// Abilene //

Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene.

I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene.

Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene.

Crowded city, ain't nothing free
Nothing in this old town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet Abilene.

Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene...

// White Lightning //

Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightning until the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug

And he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin'
You're pappy's corn squeezin'
White lightning

Yeah, the G-Men, T-Men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
White lightning

Well, I asked my old pappy
Why he called his brew
White lightning instead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew

As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin'

Thunder started clashin'
White lightning

Yeah, the G-Men, T-Men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White lightning

Well, a city slicker came
And he said, "I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff"
He took one slug and he drink it right down

And I heard him moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin'
You're pappy's corn squeezin'
White lightning

Yeah, the G-Men, T-Men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
