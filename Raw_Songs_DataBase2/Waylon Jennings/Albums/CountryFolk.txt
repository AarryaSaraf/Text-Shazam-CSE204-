// MacArthur Park //

Spring was never waiting for us girl
It ran one step ahead as we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron like a strip-ed pair of pants.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again, oh no.

I recall the yellow cotton dress
foaming like a wave on the ground around your knees
And birds like tender babies in your hands
The old man playing checkers by the trees.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again, oh no.

[Instrumental]

There will be another song for me for and I will sing it
There will be another dream for me someone will bring it
I will taste the wine while it is warm
and never let you catch me looking in the sun
But after all the loves of my life
after all the loves of my life you'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
And my passions flow like rivers from the sky
But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life
I'll still be along wondering why.

Mac Arthur Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
But I don't think that I can take it Lord
It took so long to bake it
I'll never had that recipe again, oh no...

// These New Changing Times //

I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times.

You're going places in these new changing times
Making your mark in this world is a long straight line
You need someone to go, to go along with you
To love you and help you and to do what you'll wanna do.

I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times.

[Instrumental]

You have all your dreams in these new changing times
If they seem out of reach just keep this thought in mind
You need someone to go, to go along with you
To love you and help you and to do what you'll wanna do.

I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times...

// Come Stay With Me //

I'll send away all my false pride
And I'll forsake all my life
I'll do what I can so you'll feel free
If you'll come and stay with me.

Lovers of the past I'll leave behind
There'll never be another on my mind
Yes, I'll be as true as true as you can be
If you'll come and stay with me.

Promises I make so faithfully
I'll keep still should you decide to leave
I'll try and see if you'll have all you need
If you'll come and stay with me.

We live a life no one has ever known
God gave life to you on your own
Hoping God that I stand finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me.

Hoping God that I stand finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me...

// Cindy, Oh Cindy //

I joined the navy to see the world
But nowhere could I find
A girl as sweet as Cindy
The girl I left behind
I've sailed the wide world over
Can't get her off my mind.

Cindy, oh Cindy
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

I see her face in every wave
Her lips kiss every breeze
Her loving arms reach out for me
Through calm and stormy seas
At night I pace the lonely deck
Caressed by memories.

Cindy, oh Cindy
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

I know my Cindy's waitin'
As I walk the dock alone
Her loving arms reach out for me
Soon I'll be headin' home
Then my sailing days will be over
And no more will I roam.

Cindy, oh Cindy girl
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

Cindy, oh Cindy girl
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound...

// Games People Play //

Oh, the games people now
Every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now
Never sayin' what they mean, oh no.

Well, they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine, oh yeah.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now.

Well, we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other one's to blame.

But neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame, yes it does.

People walkin' up to ya
Shouting glory hallelujah
Well, they wanna sock it to ya
In the name of the Lord.

Gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and cheat your fate
Furthermore to hell with hate
Come on and get on board.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now.

Look around and tell me what you see
What's happened to you and me
God give me the serenity
To remember who I am.

'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
'Cause you don't give a do de dee.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now...

// Mary Ann Regrets //

I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I recieved a short little note
And I'd broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
I read in the papers of far away places she's been
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

My Mary had died too sad she just wasted away
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann...

// Let Me Tell You My Mind //

Some quiet morning let me let me tell you my mind
Before the sun find you here beside me one more time
Let me tell you my mind
How I want you to stay and never think about goin' away
Oh oh, baby let me tell you my mind.
Oh oh, baby let me tell you my mind.

Crazy things keep a running through my head
Let me tell you my mind
When my shoes are under your bed one more time
Let me tell you my mind
Tell you of the thrills I find
They will keep running through my mind
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.
Mhm oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.

If my mind could write the words to say
Let me tell you my mind
I'd read them to you some better day one more time
Let me tell you my mind
If my story never ends and I never have you again
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind...

// Drivin' Nails In The Wall //

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall.

In the dark that stacks around me
Dreams of you keep pounding me
Leading me to where I've never been
And the voice keeps telling me
This could be insanity
But I know my name as well as you.

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall.

In the wilted patterns of my mind
Find that I've left you behind
Sowing up my torn memories
Surviving living, three bed room
Electric kitchen and living room
Just burning and it's on a new free way

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
When she is back I'm gonna nail to the wall...

// Long Way Back Home //

From the railhead to the boatyard
From the factory to the farm
From the mine to the millyard
I've weathered with storms.

From the barroom to the bedpost
I've wasted my days
And all I have is my drink
And the time left to think but the times slips away.

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You can see what I'm after
By the look in my eye.

Just walk away and leave me alone
'Cause it's a long way back home
Long way back home.

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You can see what I'm after
By the look in my eye.

Just walk away and leave me alone
'Cause it's a long way back home
Long way back home...

// But You Know I Love You //

When the morning sun streaks across my room
And I'm wakened up from another dream of you
Yes I'm on the road once again it seems
All I've left behind is a chain of broken dreams.
But you know I love you
Yes, I love you oh I love you.

How I wish this love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have cause I've got so much to give
And it seems so wrong deep inside my heart
That the dollar sign chould be keeping us apart.
But you know I love you
Yes, I love you oh I love you.

And if only we could find our way back to the times
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed our minds
For the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you.
I'd come running back to you.

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
And to pay the rent got us leave you all alone
But you know I made my choice many years ago
Now this traveling life is the only one I know.
But you know I love you.
Yes, I love you oh I love you.

Yes, you know I love you.
yes, I love you.
Oh, I love you...

// World Of Our Own //

We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

Close the door light the lights we'll stay at home tonight
Far away from the bustle and the bright city lights
Let the world fade away just leave us alone
And we'll live in a world of our own.

We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

Oh, my love oh my love I've cried for you so much
Lonely nights without sleeping while I long for your touch
Now your lips can erase the heartache we've known
Come with me to the world of our own.

We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own...
