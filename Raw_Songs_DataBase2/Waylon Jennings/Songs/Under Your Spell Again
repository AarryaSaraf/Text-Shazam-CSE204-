I swore the last time that you let me down
that I wouldn't see you if you came around
I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone.

You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
Dreaming those dreams again
Scheming those schemes again
I've gotta take you back just one more time.

Everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
Way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
No one else can make me feel the way you do.

You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
Dreaming those dreams again
Scheming those schemes again
I've gotta take you back just one more time.

I've gotta take you back just one more time.
I've gotta take you back just one more time.
I've gotta take you back just one more time...
