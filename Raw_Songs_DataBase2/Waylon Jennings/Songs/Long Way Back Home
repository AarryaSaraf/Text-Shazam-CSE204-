From the railhead to the boatyard
From the factory to the farm
From the mine to the millyard
I've weathered with storms.

From the barroom to the bedpost
I've wasted my days
And all I have is my drink
And the time left to think but the times slips away.

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You can see what I'm after
By the look in my eye.

Just walk away and leave me alone
'Cause it's a long way back home
Long way back home.

Just look at my face
When you tell me goodbye
You can see what I'm after
By the look in my eye.

Just walk away and leave me alone
'Cause it's a long way back home
Long way back home...
