Well, you can have her
I don't want her
She didn't loved me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

The girl I love
Upped and left me
She ran away with my best friend
Comes home at night
For just an hour
When daylight comes she's gone again.

You can have her
I don't want her
She didn't loved me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

When you're stuck
With the wrong woman
There ain't that much that you can do
You just dig a hole
And crawl right in it
Then you pull the ground right over you.

You can have her
I don't want her
She didn't loved me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

Life without love
Is mighty empty
But confession is good for your soul
I'd rather have love
For just an hour
Than have the world and all of its gold.

You can have her
I don't want her
She didn't loved me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay.

Yeah, you can have her
I don't want her
She didn't loved me anyway
She only wanted
Someone to play with
But all I wanted was love to stay...
