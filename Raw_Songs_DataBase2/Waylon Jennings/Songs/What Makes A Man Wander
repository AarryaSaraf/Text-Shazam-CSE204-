What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

The whistle of a train
Does something to my brain
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

I know I love you as much as I ever could love anyone
Yet I'm still gone
I come back and I vow to settle down
Now then I'm gone with the dawn.

What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

[Instrumental]

I know I love you as much as I ever could love anyone
Yet I'm still gone
I come back and I vow to settle down
Now then I'm gone with the dawn.

What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

Oh, what makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?...
