I gave my heart, I gave my all
You built me up then you let me fall
You wore my ring upon your hand
But then you changed your mind.

But that's all right I looked around
And found true love.

[Instrumental]

You made me laugh, you made me cry
I wished that day that I could die
You never dreamed that by and by
I'd be glad you changed your mind.

Yes, that's all right I looked around
And found true love...
