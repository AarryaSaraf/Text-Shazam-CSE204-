If my years were less, if my shoes were new
I'd pack my things and I'd leave you
Hitch myself to some westbound train
You'd never see me here again.

If I could dream as I once could
I'd be gone gone for good
I don't want to live, haven't another try
In some old house where love has died.

We once had love, it's gone now
Don't know when, don't know how
We're two strangers under one roof
No need to like it, we both know the truth.

Love has gone, there's nothing left
I wanna leave, I can't help myself
I don't want to live haven't another try
In some old house where love has died.

Too many ghosts walk the floor
Ghosts of the love that ain't no more
I'd like to have what we once had
And there ain't no use, that's too bad.

You're too much a part of me
For me to be ever free
We keep living but never try
In some old house where love has died...
