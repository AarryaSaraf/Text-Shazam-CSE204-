When I left Tulsa Jamie was an innocent young lady
God only knows why she gave herself to a guy like you
She called me cryin' said she was gonna have your baby
You just turned your back on her like all cowards do.

I swore I'd get you for what you're puttin' her through
And the only reason I ain't got you
Jamie cried and begged me not to
She still loves you for some reason

But don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa
If the sun goes down on you
If you're still here you're goin' down too
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa.

[Instrumental]

Jamie is the only thing I ever really cared for
She don't deserve this kind of shame
She's carryin' the child that you're to blame for
You just laughed and said
There ain't no way it's gonna get your name.

But I swore I'd get you for what you're puttin' her through
And the only reason I ain't got you
Jamie cried and begged me not to
But I ain't through with you yet
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa.

Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa.
Better not let the sun set on you in Tulsa.
Don't let the sun set on you in Tulsa...
