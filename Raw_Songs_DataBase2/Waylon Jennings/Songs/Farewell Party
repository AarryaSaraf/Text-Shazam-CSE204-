When the last breath of life is gone from my body
And my lips are as cold as the sea
When my friends gather 'round my farewell party
Please won't you pretend you love me?

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I'll go
And leave you in this old world alone
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party
Or will you be glad when I'm gone?

Don't be angry with me a wanting to keep you
Till my life in this old world is done and through
You'll be free at the end of my farewell party
But I'll go away loving you.

There'll be flowers from those who'll cry when I'll go
And leave you in this old world alone
Will you shed a tear at my farewell party
Or will you be glad when I'm gone?...
