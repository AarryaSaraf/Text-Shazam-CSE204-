Do you ever think about
The one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear
Why he's always waiting here for you?

Inspite of all the things you've said and done
I'm a fool and you're the only one
I'll keep waiting while you'll have your fun, just for you
Can't you see you're a part of me and everything I do?

And every dream I dream is just for you
Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear
Why he's always waiting here for you?

It makes no difference what you do or say
I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day
Just for you.

[Instrumental]

It makes no difference what you do or say
I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day
Just for you, just for you, mhm. just for you...
