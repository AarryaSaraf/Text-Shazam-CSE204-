I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I recieved a short little note
And I'd broke down inside at the message that her mother wrote.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
I read in the papers of far away places she's been
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

My Mary had died too sad she just wasted away
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they'd have left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone.

Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We'll leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann.

Goodbye true love, goodbye my sweet Mary Ann...
