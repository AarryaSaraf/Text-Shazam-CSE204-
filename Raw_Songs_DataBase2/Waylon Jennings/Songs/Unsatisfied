My woman goes about her way hangin' on from day to day God knows she's tried
To do her best for her and me
knowin' that she'll always be unsatisfied.

She tells me everything's alright
but when she should be sleepin' nights
I've heard her cry
But she greeys me like the morning sun
Makes me wish I was the one unsatisfied.

But soon the warmer wind will blow her way I know
And warm her like she never has been warmed before.

Lord she deserves the very best
With me she'll never be addressed, we'd tried and tried
But a man can tell when somethin's wrong
Woman can go just so long unsatisfied,

[Instrumental]

Soon the warmer wind will blow her way I know
And warm her like she never has been warmed before
She deserves the very best with me
She'll never be addressed God knows I've tried
But I can't be what I can't be
She can't live a life with me unsatisfied, unsatisfied.

Unsatisfied, unsatisfied...
