I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good
Norwegian Wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed.

[Instrumental]

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good
Norwegian Wood?...
