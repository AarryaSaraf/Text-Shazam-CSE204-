Oh the sun's gonna shine, in my life once more
Love's gonna live here again
Things are gonna be the way they, were before
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness, only happiness
Love's gonna live here again.

I hear bells a-ringin', I hear birds a-singin'
Love's gonna live here again
I hear bee's a-hummin, and I know the days' a-comin'
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here
Love's gonna live here again
No more loneliness, only happiness
Love's gonna live here again.

Love's gonna live here again...
