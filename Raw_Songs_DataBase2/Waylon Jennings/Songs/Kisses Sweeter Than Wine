Well, when I was a young man and never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over, how much I'd missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
And then oh Lordy, well I kissed her again.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged her and pleaded like a natural man
And then whups oh Lordy, well she gave me her hand.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...

Well, we worked very hard both me and my wife
A working hand in hand to have a good life
We had corn in the fields and whaet in the bins
And then whups oh Lord I was the father of twins

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, our children then numbered just about four
And they all had the sweethearts a knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was whups oh Lord the grandfather of eight.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lotta kids a lotta trouble and pain
But then whups oh Lord we'd do it all again.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine...
