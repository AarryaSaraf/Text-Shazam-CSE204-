That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

Don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you but don't be blue
I'll have a thousand before I'm through.

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

[Instrumental]

There you go you're cryin' again
You should have known how things would end
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again.

That's what you get for lovin' me
That's what you get for lovin' me
Everything we had is gone if you can see
That's what you get for lovin' me.

That's what you get for lovin' me...
