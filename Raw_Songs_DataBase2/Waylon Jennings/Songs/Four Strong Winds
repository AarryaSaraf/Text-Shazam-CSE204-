Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high

All these things that don't change come what may
But my good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

I may go out to Alberta
Weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I could go to working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask it one more time
But we've been through that a thousand times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And things are going good
You could join me if I send you down the fare
But if you wait until it's winter it would do no good
For the winds sure can blow cold way out there

I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
