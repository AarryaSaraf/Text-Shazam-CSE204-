I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times.

You're going places in these new changing times
Making your mark in this world is a long straight line
You need someone to go, to go along with you
To love you and help you and to do what you'll wanna do.

I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times.

[Instrumental]

You have all your dreams in these new changing times
If they seem out of reach just keep this thought in mind
You need someone to go, to go along with you
To love you and help you and to do what you'll wanna do.

I'll play the tambourine follow the sun
I'll never let you down in these new changing times...
