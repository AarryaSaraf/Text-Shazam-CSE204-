I joined the navy to see the world
But nowhere could I find
A girl as sweet as Cindy
The girl I left behind
I've sailed the wide world over
Can't get her off my mind.

Cindy, oh Cindy
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

I see her face in every wave
Her lips kiss every breeze
Her loving arms reach out for me
Through calm and stormy seas
At night I pace the lonely deck
Caressed by memories.

Cindy, oh Cindy
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

I know my Cindy's waitin'
As I walk the dock alone
Her loving arms reach out for me
Soon I'll be headin' home
Then my sailing days will be over
And no more will I roam.

Cindy, oh Cindy girl
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound.

Cindy, oh Cindy girl
Cindy, don't let me down
Write me a letter soon
And I'll be homeward bound...
