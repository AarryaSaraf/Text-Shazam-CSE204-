Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back but never meant to stay.

I've got heartaches by the numbers, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the numbers, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end.

[Instrumental]

Heartache number three was when you called me
You said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on my door
I waited but you must have lost your way.

I've got heartaches by the numbers, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less, each day I love you more
I've got heartaches by the numbers, a love that I can't win
But the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end...
