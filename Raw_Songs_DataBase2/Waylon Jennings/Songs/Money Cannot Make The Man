So long I've been trying to give you the things that you've wanted
But your thirst for riches is more than my pockets can stand
And I know that you're dreaming of things you could have with another
'Cause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the man.

You like to be seen in the richest and finest of places
You're always embarrassed by the callouses here on my hands
And I know that it's only a matter of time till you leave me
'Cause to your way of thinking the money is what makes the man.

You may find a rich man to give you the things that you long for
But if you're still lonely then darling you may understand
That with all of his gold he can't give you the love that I gave you
For a man can make money but money cannot make the man.

[Instrumental]

You may find a rich man to give you the things that you long for
But if you're still lonely then darling you may understand
That with all of his gold he can't give you the love that I gave you
For a man can make money but money cannot make the man.

A man can make money but money cannot make the man...
