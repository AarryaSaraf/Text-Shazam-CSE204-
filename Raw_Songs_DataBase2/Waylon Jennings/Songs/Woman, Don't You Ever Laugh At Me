Yes, I guess I let you make a fool of me
So I'll just go my foolish way and let you be
But if you should find some human in my misery
All I ask is, please don't laugh,
Woman don't you ever laugh at me.

All I expect is your respect
For the pride inside of me
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

[Instrumental]

I guess I was just a joke to you right from the start
And the biggest live fool of all those when I gave my heart
Now it's past you don't jest it affects my sanity
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

All I expect is your respect
For the pride inside of me
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

Uhuh woman, don't you ever laugh at me...
