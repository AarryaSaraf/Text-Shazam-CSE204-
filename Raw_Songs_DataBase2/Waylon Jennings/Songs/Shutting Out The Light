I left the light in my window
Burning bright for you
And the door to this heart of mine
I left that open too.

We once had a love together
I believe that it was true
But now you search for somethin' better
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

Yes, I'm shutting out the light in my window
Locking up the heart that beats for you
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

[Instrumental]

I still recall when you told me
But I've made your every dream come true
But we now are dreaming of another
But baby, are you only foolin' you?

If I had a chance I'd wait forever
There's no use pursuing what's not true
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

Yes, I'm shutting out the light in my window
Locking up the heart that beats for you
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you...
