It's true you have me twisted round your finger
And it seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me, to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.

For now, tomorrow and forever
I guess I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing 'cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.

A love that's strong as mine
Will make me do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches
And dreaming silly dreams.

You've got me where you want me
You keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.
Just enough to keep me hangin' on...
