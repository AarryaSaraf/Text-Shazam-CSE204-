I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way.

Misery is nothing new to me
Memories will pay in time
Another day some new tomorrow
Just might ease my troubled mind.

I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way.

I can't be the man you've made of me
Only you know how I tried
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
Maybe then you'll be satisfied.

I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way...
