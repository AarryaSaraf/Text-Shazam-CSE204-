Pretty soon this old town I'll be leaving
And I'm going just as far as I can go
'Cause ever since you've put me down
I can't stand to stay around this old town
And all the friends we used to know.

And when that old north wind comes a howlin'
And your cold arms long for company
When the moon peeps through the pines
And there's mem'ries on your mind
You're gonna wonder about me, babe
You're gonna wonder about me.

[Instrumental]

Pretty soon you may find that you miss me
But by then I'll be many miles away
I may be in Baltimore with old friends I knew before
I don't know if that's for sure. I can't say

But when that old north wind comes a howlin'
And your cold arms long for company
When the moon peeps through the pines
And there's mem'ries on your mind
You're gonna wonder about me, babe
You're gonna wonder about me.

Babe, you're gonna wonder about me.
You're gonna wonder about me.

Babe, you're gonna wonder about me...
