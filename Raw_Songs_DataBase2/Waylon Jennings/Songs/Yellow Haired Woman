Yellow haired woman
Good for nothing empty headed
Most lovely creature that I've seen
With lips that kiss with such a firy stain
Many times I've dreamed
Of leaving my life behind knowin' all the while
I'm a victim of the smile of this yellow haired woman.

[Instrumental]

Yellow woman flows across this rich satin bed
Magnified of perfect feature leaving nothing left unsaid
As I listen to her breathing suddenly
I find no escape I'm weary kind
Who sets it up my mind it's this yellow haired woman.

[Instrumental]

Many times I've dreamed
Of leaving my life behind knowin' all the while
I'm a victim of the smile of this yellow haired woman...
