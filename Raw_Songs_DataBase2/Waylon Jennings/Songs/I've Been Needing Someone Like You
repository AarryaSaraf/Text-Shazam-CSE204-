I just came in to drown some sorrow
I'll be leavin' town tomorrow
Just another bum that's passin' through
Hitchin' rides when I ain't walkin' 
Ain't had time to do no talkin'
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

Say my eyes are filled with sadness
Well, they once were filled with gladness
Once I loved someone I thought was true
But I found her with another
Since that day there's been no other
And woman I've been needin' someone like you.

[Instrumental]

Back then my better judgement failed me
Tried to kill him and they jailed me
And though that happened back in '62
Can't hold the job 'cause no one wants me
With the past like mine that haunts me
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

The luck of love and conversation
Kills the man like snow starvation
Five long years that's all that I've gone through
Now you say that's all behind me
It was meant for you to find me
Woman I've been needin' someone like you.

Yes, woman I've been needin' someone like you...
