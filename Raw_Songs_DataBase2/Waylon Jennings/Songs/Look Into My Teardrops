Look into my teardrops
And darling you will see
The reflection of an angel
That made a fool of me.

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the eyes
That promised me so many things
But all of them were lies.

Look into my teardrops
The mirror of my soul
And you will see the girl who
Stilled my only world but I couldn't hold.

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the one
That broke my heart forever
Aren't you proud of what you've done?

[Instrumental]

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the one
That broke my heart forever
Aren't you proud of what you've done?...
