I know your leaving's too long overdue
For too long I've had nothing new to show you
Goodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone.

No regrets, no tears, goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again.

[Instrumental]

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The toughts we used to share I now keep alone
I awoke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone.

No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again.

[Instrumental]

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghost away
Just beayond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
It feels so strange to leave my life alone.

No regrets no tears goodbye
Don't want you back
We'd only cry, again
Say goodbye, again...
