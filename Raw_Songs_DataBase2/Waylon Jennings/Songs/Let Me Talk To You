Just one more dance
Just one more chance
So I can talk to you
We've both have paid
Don't be afraid
Just let me try to prove
I would do anything
You want me to.

Just one more dance
Just one more chance
Let me talk to you
Don't go too far.
With that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win 
Let's fall in love again
Give me your heart 
And let me start 
To build our life anew.

Just one more dance 
Just one more chance 
Let me talk to you
Just one more dance 
Just one more chance 
Let me talk to you...
