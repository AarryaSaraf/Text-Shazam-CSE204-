Well, I've come here to tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right
I'm a tramp and a rounder
I stay out late at night.

I pour a high steak
Three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer
In this old town can afford.

A big electric fan
Keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy
Play's around daddy's feet.

I'm a rounder, I'm a gambler
Lord, I lead every fight
I tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right.

[Instrumental]

When I got married
I knew I'd settled down
I built a little lovenest
Right near in my hometown.

Now, I've got a family
One that I'm proud of
I know that they'll be happy
'Cause I'm the one they love.

A big electric fan
Keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby boy
Play's around daddy's feet.

I'm a rounder, I'm a gambler
Lord, I lead every fight
I tell you boys
I'm ragged but I'm right...
