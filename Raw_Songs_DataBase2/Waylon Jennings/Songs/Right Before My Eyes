You do the things that hurt me
So right before my eyes
Just because I love you so
I overlook your lies.

Let you make a fool of me
Yes, that's what I'll always be
'Cause I pretend not to see
What's right before my eyes.

Everyone keeps telling me
What's right before my eyes
Love is blind and I can't see
What's right before my eyes.

[Instrumental]

I can't make myself believe
What's right before my eyes
I thought your love belonged to me
But now I realize.

You couldn't care and act this way
There's nothing I can do or say
Just watch my dream will fade away
Right before my eyes.

Everyone keeps telling me
What's right before my eyes
Love is blind and I can't see
What's right before my eyes...
