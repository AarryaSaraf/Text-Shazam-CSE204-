Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off.

My dreams're shattered don't you see
Now you no longer care for me
I miss the wonder of your kiss
How could you leave me here like this?

Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off.

[Instrumental]

Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off...
