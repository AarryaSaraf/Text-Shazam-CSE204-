She called me baby, baby all night long
Used to hold and kiss me till the dawn
Then one day I woke and she was gone
There's no more baby, baby all night long.

She called me baby, baby all night long
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong
What I'd give if she'd just come back home
And call me baby, baby all night long.

[Instrumental]

She called me baby, baby all night long
Held me up so high and made me strong
Now each time in dreams just like a song
I still hear baby, baby all night long.

I still hear baby, baby all night long...
