You have made no secret of your new love affair
He buys you pretty presents and he takes you everywhere
You seen him all the places where you and I once went
Sit and hold each other tight in front of all our friends.

Everybody knows, everybody knows why my heart cries.

[Instrumental]

There's no need to tell you you're too in love to see
Anything that I told you you'd call jealousy
But if he ever breaks your heart the way that you broke mine
Just come running back to me you're welcome anytime.

Everybody knows, everybody knows
Why my heart cries
Everybody knows how your love for him grows
While my love dies...
