You don't know what's good for you
You won't leave me alone
I know you've got a family
Sleepin' at home.

Don't make me go out of my way
don't tempt me please
Don't you be so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

I'm all alone and need someone
I guess that it shows
But the things you make me want to do
I'll regret I know.

So don't say things that you don't mean
'Cause I just might believe
Don't you be so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

I'm gonna leave tonight with you
Go on and have your fun
I don't want to be a part
Of what I might have done.

I'm tempted when I think about
The things that might have been
And I'll admit I'd like to try
But I know I couldn't win.

And so instead I'll say goodbye
I know it's time to leave
'Cause you been so nice to me
And I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

'Cause you been so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

'Cause you been so nice to me...
