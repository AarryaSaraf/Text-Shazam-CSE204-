I've been walking in the shadows for so long
That I forgot the sun could shine
I've turned away from everything and everyone
That wanted to be mine.

Somehow I always shut my eyes and heart
To anything that I might share
Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

Every path I've taken I've turned around
And quickly closed the door
It seems that all I knew if I ever stop
To feel I want more.

I kept a steady run so my eyes
Could never focus anywhere
Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

How long have you been standing there
Protecting me from love that shouldn't be
Knowing all along that I would realize
That you were meant for me.

Now, I've got to mend every broken fence
And bridge that I have burned
And clear away the cobwebs
In my heart so I can start to learn.

For now I realize that you've been waiting
Just to teach me how to care
Now, I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?...
