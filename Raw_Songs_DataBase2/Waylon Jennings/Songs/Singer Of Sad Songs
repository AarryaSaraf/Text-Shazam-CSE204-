Widow Jones couldn't make it on her own
Frank was 'lectrafied leaving six kids half grown
In her misery she sent for me the singer of sad songs
And I sympathized and eulogized Frank Jones.

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts I'll wash your clothes
And mend your socks for your pay.

Farmer Brown had always dreamed of city lights
Mini skirts on pretty girls were in his sights
So one early morn he left his corn to harvest a field of sin
Mrs. Brown called me shortly after three a.m..

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts got some
Early hybrid corn for your pay.

Lovely Lucy sat there sippin' a glass of wine
She was at the church waitin' till after nine
But the groom to be was somewhere free with a case of yellow spine.
Lovely Lucy she's still a virgin and that's a crime.

And she cried singer of sad songs
I need your services today
Doctor of broken hearts got a
Slightly used diamond for your pay...
