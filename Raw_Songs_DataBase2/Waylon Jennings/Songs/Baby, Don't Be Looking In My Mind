Baby don't be looking in my mind
You might not like what you find
For honey, I know you better than you think
I do so baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Don't expect sweet I-love-you's on and on
If I didn't love you I'd be gone
Don't change the way I live just take what I can give
And baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Don't expect my every thought to be of you
For I'm a man and men have things to do
I'm proud to be your man and I love you all I can
But baby, don't be looking in my mind.

[Instrumental]

Don't expect my every thought to be of you
For I'm a man and men have things to do
I'm proud to be your man and I love you all I can
But baby, don't be looking in my mind.

Baby, don't be looking in my mind...
