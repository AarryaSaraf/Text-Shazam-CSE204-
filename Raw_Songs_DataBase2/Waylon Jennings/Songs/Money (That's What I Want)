The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees
Now give me money
That's what I want

You're lovin' gives me a thrill
But you're lovin' don't pay my bills
Now give me money
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money
That's what I want

Money don't get everything, it's true
What it don't get, I can't use
Now give me money
That's what I want

Well, now give me money, money
Wow, yeah, I wanna be free
I want money
That's what I want

That's what I want
Now give me money, money
You need money, give me money
That's what I want

That's what I want
