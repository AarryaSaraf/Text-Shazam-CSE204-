In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever had laid eyes on
But a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride but he lied.

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man.

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?...
