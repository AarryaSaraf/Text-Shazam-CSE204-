Girls have been a weakness all of my life
But I made a big mistake and I took one for a wife
I've thought that she was different I could settle down
But she won't and I didn't by now I'm leavin' town.

This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.

[Instrumental]

I'll be a datin' those southern belles there'll be no days of blue
All the queens in New Orleans I'll get around with you
When sun went down I'll come back up I'll be countin' every hour
Till I'm back headin' south for sweet sweet magnolia flowers.

This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone...
