She said if I ever deceived her
She'd be gone before I could count ten
Well, I guess that I didn't believe her
'Cause look at the trouble that I'm in.

And now he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Cryin' won't bring her back
The more that I cry the faster the train
Flies farther on down the track.

[Instrumental]

If I only knew where to find her
I'd crawl there on my hands and knees
But each tick of the clock is a reminder
She's one second farther from me.

And now he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Cryin' won't bring her back
The more that I cry the faster the train
Flies farther on down the track...
