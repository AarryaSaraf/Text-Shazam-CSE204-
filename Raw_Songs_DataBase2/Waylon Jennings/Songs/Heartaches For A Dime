I called you on the phone to say I love you
That I'd stop by for you at nine
My heart broke when you said that it's all over
Someone else would take up all your time.

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime.

[Instrumental]

I went downtown to join the merry makers
I told myself that here's where I belong
I thought that I was doin' fine without you
And then I heard somebody play our song.

And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime
I'll never know what made you change your mind
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime.

That's a lot of heartaches for a dime...
