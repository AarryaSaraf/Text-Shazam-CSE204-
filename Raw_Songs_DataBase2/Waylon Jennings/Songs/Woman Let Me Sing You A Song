Woman let me sing you a song
Woman let me sing you a song
That tells how you've done me wrong
So it's your fault if it's long.
Woman let me sing you a song.

Well, the neighbors all say I run around
Yeah. the neighbors all say I run around
But baby if I do I'm still miles in back off you
Woman let me sing you a song.

[Instrumental]

You tell our friends I drink too much
Now the whole town knows I drink too much
But the reason why I drink
Is a thought you make to think
Woman let me sing you a song.

Woman let me sing you a song
Woman let me sing you a song
I said I'd die for you
And I have the time or two
Woman let me sing you a song.

Now, woman I've done sang you my song...
