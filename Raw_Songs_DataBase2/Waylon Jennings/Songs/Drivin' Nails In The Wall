Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall.

In the dark that stacks around me
Dreams of you keep pounding me
Leading me to where I've never been
And the voice keeps telling me
This could be insanity
But I know my name as well as you.

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall.

In the wilted patterns of my mind
Find that I've left you behind
Sowing up my torn memories
Surviving living, three bed room
Electric kitchen and living room
Just burning and it's on a new free way

Here I sit drivin' nails in the wall
Thinking I hear someone in my hall
She said that she'd be back in no time at all
When she is back I'm gonna nail to the wall...
