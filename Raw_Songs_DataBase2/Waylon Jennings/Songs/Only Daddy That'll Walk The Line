Everybody knows you've been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
You keep a steppin' out of line 
You're messin' with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit


'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

I keep a workin' every day all you want to is play
I'm tired of stayin' out all night
I'm comin' unglued 
From your funny little moods
Now Honey baby that ain't right



[Solo]


You keep a packin' up my clothes nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a puttin' me on
But when I start a walkin' 
Gonna hear you start a squawkin'
And beggin' me to come back home



You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
