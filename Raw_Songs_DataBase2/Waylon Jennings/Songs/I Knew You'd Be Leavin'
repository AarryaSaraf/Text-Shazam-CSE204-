I won't take your hand when you turn to walk away in the morning
And I'll try not to cry when you say goodbye you try to warn me
Some morning you'd wake up an ocean would arise and you'd be gone
I knew that you'd be leavin' when your reason for stayin' is gone.

My words of I love you keep creeping into my conversation
Like you always told me any love for you would be a fool's creation
I guess the unit of loving me no longer holds the flavor you once known
I knew that you'd be leavin' when your reason for stayin' is gone.

So I'll just lay here in your arms and hope the dawn comes very slowly
We had our time for love but now the time has come you'll be goin'
I won't question you with what I guess I've known all along
I knew that you'd be leavin' when your reason for stayin' is gone...
