Travelin' down on different roads
Tryin' hard to leave the load
Take it there but we can't let go
It's so hard to lay it down.

Back in Eden we were tried
Found ourselves disatisfied
Seeking wisdom that she denied
Tryin' hard to lay it down.

Lay it down brother, lay it down
It's so hard to lay it down.

Hide in me, confide in me
Don't you think it's time to be
Everything we tried to be
You and me should lay it down.

Speak to me, be unashamed
There's no need in playing games
After all we're all the same
Just tryin' hard to lay it down.

Lay it down brother, lay it down
It's so hard to lay it down.

Wish my words could make it well
Wish that I could break the shell
Take us from myself made hell
Find a way to lay it down.

Burdened by the things I've learned
Hurtin' 'cause I'm too concerned
Nonetheless I confess I yearn
To find a way to lay it down.

Lay it down, lay it down
Wish that I could lay it down...
