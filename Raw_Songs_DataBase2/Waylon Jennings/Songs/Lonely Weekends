Well, I make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Since you left me
I'm as lonely as I can be
Oh, those lonely weekends.

Said you'd be true to me
You said our love's never gonna die
Said you'd be true to me
But baby you didn't even try.

I'll make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends.

[Instrumental]

You said you'd be true to me
You said our love's never gonna die
Said you'd be true to me
But baby you didn't even try.

I'll make it alright
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends.

Oh, those lonely weekends.
Oh, those lonely weekends...
