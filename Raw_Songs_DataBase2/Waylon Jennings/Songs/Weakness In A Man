Honey, how you've changed
It makes me wonder have I ever really known you
How could you abuse and use
The kindeness and tenderness that I have shown you.

If I had known then, I have shown
The strenght on which my love could make a stand
But you've mistaken tenderness and kindness
For the weakness in your man.

I can give you almost anything
If I know what you're looking for
I can give you everything
Any other man can give and more.

He may promise you the world
But I can give you everything he can
So don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man.

[Instrumental]

I may live my life alone
With walls of stone inside some lonely cell
But no man's gonna take the love I own
And never live to tell the tale.

So don't forsake the vows you made
And don't remove my little golden band
And don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man.

Don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man...
