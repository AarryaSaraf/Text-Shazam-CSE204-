He offers you so many things that I can't give
I know your young heart just can't turn him down
And like you say you're free and it's your life to live
See you around on your way down.

You're much too young to know
The value of a love that's true
I don't think he'll ever learn to love you
Or think half as much of you as I do.

You can't see me your head is too high in the clouds
But I'll be waiting on my side of town
In case you need me and you will I have no doubt
See you around on your way down.

[Instrumental]

Like you say you're free and it's your life to live
See you around on your way down.

I'll see you around girl on your way down...
