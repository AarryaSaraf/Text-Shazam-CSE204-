Don't make me sad
Girl, why you have to
Treat me so bad, yeah

Don't break my heart, no, no (don't break it)

Come on, baby
Don't make me blue
'Cause don't you know that
I'm in love with you, yeah

Don't (baby, baby, baby)
Don't break my heart, no, no, no (don't break it)

Come on, baby
Don't make me sad
Girl, why you have to
Treat me so bad, aha

Don't break my heart (don't break it)
Don't (baby, baby, baby)
Don't break my heart, don't you do it to me
