I don't know why but it's hard to do
I can't break away from you
Don't want something new

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
Goodbye

Can't stop, can't let it go
Without you I'm all alone
Let's spend the night together

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)

I know that we can work it out
This feeling's too good to lose
Love is good thing

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do
Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do
Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do
