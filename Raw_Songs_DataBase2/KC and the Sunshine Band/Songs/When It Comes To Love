Love is never enough (when it comes to love)
Never too much (when it comes to love)
Never was (when it comes to love)
Love is never enough (when it comes to love)
Never too much (when it comes to love)
Never was

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

You don't put me down
Turn me on, turn me on
You only show me love
What life is about
Without any doubt in your mind

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

Your love is a especial type
Always rare on time
Never too hard to find
You love in a especial way
That words can't explain
Love shines in every way
Everyday and always

I'm so glad that you found me
Saved me
Took me in your arms
I'm so glad that you found me
Show me
That love can stand on us all life

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Loving you is never wrong
Loving you is never much
Ohhh no
Feeling you is never enough
Loving you is never wrong
Touching you is never much
Ohhhh love
Loving you is never wrong

When it, when it, when it comes to love
When it comes to love
When it comes to love
Loving you is never wrong

(Loving you is never enough, never too much
Take me to your heart and mind
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me in your arms, baby
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me to your heart and mind
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me in your arms, baby)

Love is never enough
