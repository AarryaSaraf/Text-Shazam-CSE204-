Tonight, we'll take it slow
And the moment will take control, ooh
It's love that we need
That we can't let it go

Na na na na na na na na na

The way I feel
Touches every emotion, yeah, ooh
And that look you're giving me
Tells me all I need to know

Oh yeah, in a beautiful way
Oh yeah, makes it such a beautiful day

Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Ooh ah ah
Ooh ah ah ah
Everlasting love
Filled with no regrets
And the meaning of love
Is designed to keep us together

Oh yeah, in a beautiful way
Oh yeah, makes it such a beautiful day

Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come
With me
Let this be a night to remember

Na na na na na na
