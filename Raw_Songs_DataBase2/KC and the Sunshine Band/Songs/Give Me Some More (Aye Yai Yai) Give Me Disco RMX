I like it I love it 
Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
Turn off the lights
Clothes to the floor
This thing that we're feeling
Just can't be ignored 

The more that you love me
Kiss me touch me
You have me wanting you
When I'm near you 
It feels so good
I could get addicted to you

Over and over
Let's do it again
Tonight we'll go
Where we have never been 
Living the dream havin' a good time 
In the heat of thew night you 
You got me sayin

I like it I love it 
Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
Turn off the lights
Clothes to the floor
This thing that we're feeling
Just can't be ignored 

Aye yai yai yai!
Aye yai yai yai!

As lights fill the night 
Things start to ignite
I can feel the heat 
Of your love

Take me wherever
You want to go 
I'll do anything 
You can think of

Over and over
Let's do it again
Tonight we'll go
Where we have never been 
Living the dream havin' a good time 
In the heat of the night
You got me sayin

I like it I love it 
Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
Turn off the lights
Clothes to the floor
Wanting you more
Than ever before

I like it I love it 
Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
Turn off the lights
Clothes to the floor
This thing that we're feeling
Just can't be ignored 

Aye yai yai yai!
Aye yai yai yai!

It feels like heaven
So like heaven
It feels like heaven
When I'm with you 
I like it I love it 
Oh

Over and over
Let's do it again

Where we have never been 
Living the dream havin' a good time 
In the heat of thew night

Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
