When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

What are you waiting for
You should be on the floor
Why would you take so long
To party with the funky song

(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing
Everybody should be stomping their feet
(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing
And party with this get down beat

When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

I did not come here
To just sit around
See I came here to party
If my feet up off the ground

(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing
Everybody should be stomping their feet
(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing
And party with this get down beat

When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

Get on the floor

C'mon let's dance, gives us a chance
C'mon let's dance, gives us a chance
C'mon let's dance, gives us a chance
C'mon let's dance, gives us a chance

When you dance to the music
