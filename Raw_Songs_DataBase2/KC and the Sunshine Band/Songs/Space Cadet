I'm a space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet always higher
Space cadet always flying
Space cadet without even trying

Where I come from you never grow old
There's no crying, we walk on streets of gold
It's a different world with lots of love
Of to visit space above

I'm a space cadet getting higher
Space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet always trying
Space cadet always flying

Space cadet getting higher
Space cadet, I'm a moonlight rider
Space cadet, light my fire
Space cadet, I'll go flying

Don't be afraid when we fly
You'll feel peace deep inside
When you try it I'm sure you'll like it
Come on, baby, why don't you try it?

Space cadet getting higher
Space cadet alive and wired
Space cadet moving higher
Space cadet always flying

Space cadet, space cadet
I'm a space cadet, space cadet
I'm a space cadet, different worlds
Space cadet, lots of lonely girls

Space cadet always trying
Space cadet always flying
Space cadet, I'm a space cadet
Space cadet, I'm a space cadet
