Watching raindrops falling
Taking me back to when I saw you
In those summer nights
I've been often wondering
How could I fall into a thing that was so right?

But you appeared to me
Your love was heavenly
Hot summer memories
Taking me back, taking me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
(Those summer nights)
You stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupids arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)

We were often running
Suddenly summer disappeared and so did you
Should have seen it coming
Nothing so good could ever last a whole life through

Now just your ghost remains
Living inside my brain
Now every time it rains
It takes me back, it takes me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupids arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)

Now just your ghost remains
Living inside my brain
Now every time it rains
It takes me back, it takes me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupid's arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
(Summer nights, those summer nights, those summer nights)

Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupid's arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights, those summer nights)

Summer nights, those summer nights
(Those summer nights)
Stepped out of a dream
Summer nights, summer nights
A sensual sea
Summer nights, summer nights
