Three weeks ago I met you baby
Ooh what a thrill you gave me
Now I hear you got to go away
Ooh babe I need ya every day

You don't know how much you mean to me

It was only yesterday when you and me
Were together in every way
We share a time of love and happiness
Oh I'm gonna miss this things yeah

You don't know how much you mean to me
You'll never know how much you mean to me

Ah ha ha oh baby ah ha ha baby

But if you really have to go
Here along I'll have to stay I know
Oh it's times that I ask why the one
I really love must say good bye

Ah ha ha baby
I really love ya baby I really need ya
You don't know no you don't know
