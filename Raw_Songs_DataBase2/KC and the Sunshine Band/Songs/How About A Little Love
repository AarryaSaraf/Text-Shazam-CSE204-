Feeling alone isn't my kind of thing
No, I don't like being alone
So, why don't you come love me?
Oh baby, let's get it off

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?
Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?

Looking straight in your direction
Baby, I've got my eyes on you
Look at me baby, look and see
Are you lonely, got nothing to do?

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?
Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh
How about a little love?

La-da-da-da, la-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la, la, la, la, la
La-da-da-da, la-la-la

Hey now baby, oh, oh, oh (set sail, set sail)
How about a little love?
