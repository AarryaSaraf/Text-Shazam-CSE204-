Take you like what you felt about it
What you thought about it
Did it do what you thought it would do
In my, in my dreams about it
I wanna get sexual
I wanna get sexual with you

I know what we can do
I know how to make it happen too

Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again
Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again

Many times I thought about it
Really thought about it
What it would be like being with you
Gonna learn about
Gonna learn how
Give my loving all to you

I know what we can do
I know how to make it happen too

Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again
Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again

All the love I can show you to
I know exactly what I wanna do
C'mon, baby, know you want it to
I'm gonna make it happen for you

Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again
Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again

Down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again
Let's go down and down again
Round and round again
Let's go down again

Let's go, let's go round
I wanna get sexual with you
Let's go down
Round and round
Let's go down again
Let's go down again
C'mon baby, c'mon with me now
Let's go down again
