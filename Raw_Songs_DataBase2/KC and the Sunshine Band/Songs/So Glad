I was so glad when I woke up this morning
Just to see the smile on your face
And the tender love that you give me
Leaves me feeling good the rest of the day

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Oh, I'm feeling so, so happy now
Not a cloud left in my sky
All I see is the summer shining
What a feeling, oh deep inside yeah

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Woo, yeah
Oh, I'm happy now
Ooh, I look good inside
Now I've got your sweet, sweet loving
You're the apple of my eye

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

I'm so glad when I woke up this morning
Just to see the smile on your face
And the tender love that you give me
Leaves me feeling good the rest of the day

I'm so glad, so glad
I'm so glad you're mine
I'm so glad, so glad (yes I am)
I'm so glad you're mine

Hmm, mm-yeah, yes I am
Hmm, mm-ooh, oh
Hmm, mm, yes I am
Hmm, mm, don't you know?

So glad, so glad
So glad you're mine
So glad, so glad
So glad you're mine
