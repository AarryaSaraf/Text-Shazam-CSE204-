It's midnight, the moon is full and shining bright
All I can think of is being with you tonight
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

Oh, girl, you're hot, hot to try
Sexy baby, ooh, a foxy lady
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

I can't wait
No, no, no, ugh
I can't wait any longer
No, no, no, ooh

It's midnight, the moon is full and shining bright
All I can think of is being with you tonight
Do me, groove me, do what you want to
Take me and hold me, and do whatever you like

Do what you want to, to me, move me
Do whatever you like (do me)
Do what you want to take me, hold me
And do whatever you like
Oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
I can't wait (any longer)
I can't wait any longer (to do)
I can't wait

Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

I can't wait any longer, no, no, no (do me)
I can't wait any longer (do whatever you like), no, no, no
I can't wait any longer, no, no, no
I can't wait any longer, no, no, no, oh

Just do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me (all night), do whatever you like

So j-j-j-j-just do me, so j-j-j-j-just do me
