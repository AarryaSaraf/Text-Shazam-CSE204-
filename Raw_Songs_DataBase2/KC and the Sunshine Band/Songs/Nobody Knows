Startin' out on my own
Away from home
New place, new style
People I don't know

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

I may not have clothes like you
But they are new
You may be better than me
But who are you?

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Startin' out on my own
Away from home
New place, new style
People I don't know

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Damn right
Nobody knows

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
