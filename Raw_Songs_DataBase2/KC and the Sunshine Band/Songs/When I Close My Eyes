When I close my eyes
Oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha, ah, yeah

Girl I used to play around
Never thought you would happen to me
I played a nice song and cleared the doubt
When my heart skipped a beat suddenly

I couldn't take my eyes off you
Couldn't cleave when you were touching me
And after we dance in the night all through
In my dreams you were all I could see, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) ah, ah, yeah

I can't believe what I have found
Girl you're all that I need
Every night when the lights go down
You face is all that I see, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) I, I could see the light, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes, ooh
(I close my eyes) yeah

When I close my eyes, I can see your smile
Girl I see the light in you
And when I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

When I close my eyes, I can see your smile
Girl I see the light in you
When I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

Girl I used to run around
Never thought you would happen to me
And late at night, when my heart starts to pound
In my dreams you were all I could see, oh

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) I can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) I know when I close my eyes

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) all I see is you, yeah
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I close my eyes, I can see you smile
(Oh, I see you smile)
Oh, I see the light in you
(I see the light in you, yeah)
When I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

When I close my eyes, I can see you smile
(I can see you smile)
Girl I see the light in you
(I see the light in you, yeah)
When I close my eyes I feel just like a child
(Feel like a child)
Girl you give me something new

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
(When I close my eyes) in my dreams I think of you, yeah
