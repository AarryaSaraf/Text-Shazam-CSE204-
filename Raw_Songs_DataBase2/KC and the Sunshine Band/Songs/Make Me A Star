Make me a star

Make me a star
I want to appear before
Thousands of people
In a crowd

Make me a star
I want to sing my songs
To help the people
Laugh and smile

I pray my dream comes true
I wanna be just like you
I've seen the things you do
Make me a star

Make me a star
Like Willman sings
Beauty queens
Everything I need

Make me a star
Shining lights
Party nights and
Golden rings

And wouldn't you love me, girl
If I were a star
I wouldn't break your heart
If I was there when you want

Make me a star

Make me star
Would that change the way you feel about me
Make me a star
Or am I standing here with everything you ever need

Make me a star
Make me a star
Make me a star
Make me a star
