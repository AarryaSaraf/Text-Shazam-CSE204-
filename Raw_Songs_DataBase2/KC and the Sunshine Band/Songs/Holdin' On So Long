Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Holding on

Holding back and holding on
And holding in my love
Taking time to move you deep inside
Moving slow, steady goes
Your body and your mind
When we go, I won't leave you behind
Spread your wings, tonight we're gonna fly

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let you go
Holding on so long
I'm about to explode
Holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long
Hmm, yeah, yeah

Once again, starting is
Second time around
Keep it up, please don't make a sound
Hold on tight, you're gonna leave the ground

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let go
Holding on so long
I'm about to explode
Holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long
Holding on

I've been holding on so long
That I've gotta let go
I've been holding on so long
I'm about to explode
I've been holding on so long
And my love's gotta flow
Holding on so long

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Holding, holding on so long
I've gotta let go
Oh, I've been holding on too long
