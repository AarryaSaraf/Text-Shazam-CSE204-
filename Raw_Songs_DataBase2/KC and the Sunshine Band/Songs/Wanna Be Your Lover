Oh my darling you got the thrill 'bout it
I could see the sunshine in the sky
Down on the sand of the sunny beach of
Miami that's in the magic city
Everybody wants your body, yeah
Bring you what we all just like instead
Got to have your loving right away
When the sun trapped up in your way (say, say)

I wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover

In the sun, there's so much fun
With the rhythm there for everyone
I can see it, I can feel it now
I know you can feel the beat now
Come on baby, don't you run away
You gotta stay, just stay one more day
And the sun trapped up in your way
That's when we're gonna have a party

I wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover

Lover, got to be my lover

Wanna be, wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover
I wanna be your lover
Wanna be, wanna be your lover

Jump, jump, jump, a little higher
Jump, jump, jump, watch me now
Jump, jump, jump, a little higher
Jump, jump, jump

Jump, jump, jump, a little higher
Jump, jump, jump, watch me now
Jump, jump, jump, a little higher
Jump, jump, jump, oh, oh
