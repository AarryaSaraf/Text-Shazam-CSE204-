I wanna know, do you want me?
I wanna know, am I all you need?
Sometimes I feel I get no respect
And when you give love is fifty percent

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I've saw in love, where is my mind?
I wouldn't wonder from time to time
I feel that I had something to live for
But you make me feel like I
I can't be sure, now...

I ask myself if you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

Friends I can to can all for the answer
They only confuse me and lead me nowhere
You are the key in needing to unlock me
To bring out the best love inside me now

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I got to know (I ask myself)

Come on and bring out your love inside too
That's all I need now for you to do
Love me or leave me
Let me be lonely
I'll give all, you gotta in love me only now

I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
Got to know (I ask myself)
I got to know (I ask myself)

I ask myself (I ask myself)
Oh babe (I ask myself)
I wanna know (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)

Uh now I ask myself, do you really love me?
I ask myself, do you really care?
I ask myself, do you really want me?
I ask myself, if your love is there

I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
I ask myself (I ask myself)
(I ask myself, I ask myself)
(I ask myself)
