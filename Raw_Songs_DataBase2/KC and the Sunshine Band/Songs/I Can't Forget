I can't forget
That I love you
So many memories
All of them to remind me

Oh, I can't forget
I love, I love you
Oh, I can't forget
That I, I still love you, I do
Yeah, oh yeah
Mm, oh yeah

My heart still breaks
I, I don't understand
Then maybe I do
I like holding your hand

Oh, I (I) I can't forget (I can't forget)
I love, I love you
Oh, I (I) I can't forget (I can't forget)
That I, I, I still love you, I do
Oh yeah

Oh I, I can't forget that I love you
Forever and ever
Oh I, I can't forget, I can't forget, I can't forget
Oh I, I can't forget, I can't forget, I can't forget
That I still love you, I do
