I've got this funny feeling
You're gonna let me down
And I see by your expression

That you've been messing around
I know that you've been lying
So take me for a clown, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry

I thought I loved you dearly
Guess I was hypnotised
'Cause now I see you clearly
And I can't believe my eyes
You know what you doing
Don't leave me double-tied, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah!

Hey there baby
I've got to give away love when my tears are falling
You tearing me apart
All my friends are laughing at my back now baby
I should've known, that you were no good from the start
So don't ask me for no mercy
The pain don't leave my heart, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry (make me cry)
Go now before there's trouble (I get that)
Go now before I lose my mind (lose my mind)
Go now before there's trouble (I get that)
Go now before I spit in your eye (get out of my life)
Go now before there's trouble (go now baby)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now baby)
Go now before you make me cry
