// (You Said) You'd Gimme Some More //

Liar, liar
Telling me a bag of lies
You don't mean a thing you say tonight
You promised me days and days
Now you're gonna go and change your ways
I've seen you 'round somebody else
You must be doin' something else
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
No, no, no, no
Liar, liar, liar
Why you wanna do this to me
I've been so good to you can't you see
I've given everything you want
But seems to make no difference at all
I want your body - I need it now
I need some lovin' - I need it somehow
Baby, you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more
You said you'd give me some more

// Party With Your Body //

I want you tonight
I watch your body moves
And your moves are out of sight
I know you've got to tools
To fix a grown man upright
We'll be dancin' and romancin'
Oh baby, won't you spend the night
We'll be movin' - it's so soothin'
Don't it make you feel alright
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Now jazzercise is the latest trend
She keeps me up with hype
It was designed to keep her body thin
Boy I'm hot tonight
We'll be dancin' and romancin'
Oh baby, won't you spend the night
We'll be movin' - it's so soothin'
Don't it make you feel alright
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Party with your body
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Baby, party hardy
Can you find your see-through gown
So we can lay your body down
Won't you put on your negligee
So we can play tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
Party with your body
I want you tonight
I want you tonight
Party with your body
I want you tonight

// Don't Run (Come Back to Me) //

Strangely as it seems
You're the one, it's not make believe
Something's wrong, you're caught again
I'm chasing you to just nowhere

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me

Don't go breaking our hearts
It's just not the way to start
I say I can change all that
One chance I'll prove you that

To find the love is often hard
So many times it falls apart
I know this is not the same
It's love for real, I can't explain

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) don't walk away no, no
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) you're the one, you're the one, my darling
(Don't run) don't run away from me, no
(Don't run) 'cause you know where you belong

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) don't walk away no, no
(Don't run) I need your loving (you're the one, you're the one, you're the one)
I need your loving

// You're Going Out Of Your Mind //

One, two, three, four

You say you wanna run
You say you wanna go far away
You're not doing too well
You don't like what's going down today
You say you gotta get back
You gotta get back to where you were

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind

Mind, mind, mind
Mind, mind, mind

You say you wanna run 'cause you feel you're on the loose
Nothing could strike
Nothing could doubt me, it gets awkward here
You say you gotta get back
You gotta get back to where you were

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind (mind)
Mind
Mind
You're going out of your mind (mind)
Mind

You say you wanna find a place there's nowhere to hide
You've looked everywhere
You've climbed every mountain side
You say you wanna get back
You wanna get back to where you were

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind

You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind
You're going out of your mind

You say you wanna get back
You wanna get back you're going (out of your mind)
You say you gotta get back
You gotta get back, you're going (out of your mind)

You say you wanna get back
You wanna get back you're going (out of your mind)
You say you gotta get back
You gotta get back, you're going, going (out of your mind)
You say you wanna get back
You wanna get back you're going, going (out of your mind)

// It's Too Hard To Say Goodbye //

I don't know why but it's hard to do
I can't break away from you
Don't want something new

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
Goodbye

Can't stop, can't let it go
Without you I'm all alone
Let's spend the night together

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)

I know that we can work it out
This feeling's too good to lose
Love is good thing

It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)
It's too hard to say goodbye
(Too hard to say goodbye)

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do
Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do
Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do

Too hard to say goodbye
Breaking up is hard to do

// When You Dance To The Music //

When you dance to the music (dance, dance)
You can get down to it (to it, to it)
Ah, let your body move it (dance, dance)
C'mon and get down to it (to it, to it)

You should be on the floor
Why would you take so long
To party with the funky song

(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing
Everybody should be stomping their feet
(Everybody) Everybody should be dancing

To just sit around

// Are You Feeling Like Me //

I can feel the motion
I can feel your motion
Are you feeling like me?
Are you feeling like me?

Feeling strong and on stronger
I can't hold back any longer
Are you in the ecstasy?
Are you feeling like me? Yeah

Are you feeling like me?
Show me
Are you feeling like me?
Reach out

Are you feeling like me?
Touch me, love me
That I love you
Yes I love

Do you see it in my eyes?
I can see it in your eyes
Is it part of verbal lies?

Are you feeling like me?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you feeling like me?
Are you feeling like me?

Are you feeling like me?
Like me?
