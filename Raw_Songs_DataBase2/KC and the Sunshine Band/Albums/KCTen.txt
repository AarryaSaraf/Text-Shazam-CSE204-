// Are You Ready? //

Give it up
Start me up
Don't stop
I can't get enough

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Body talk
No walk
Sh-sh-sh-show me
Your hot stuff

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

// On The Top //

The stars are bright, the mood is right
I'm getting on the top 2night
My body's hot, never stop
You know, I know you know I'm right
Ow!

When I get that feeling, I get wound up
I'm on the top
When we lay it down, I'm on the top
Gotta get that feeling

In the nighttime 'til the sun shines
With a fantasy that drives my mind
With my body heat, with my body heat
Baby, let me lay it on the line
Ow!

When I get that feeling, I get wound up
I'm on the top
When we lay it down, I'm on the top
Gotta get that feeling

When I get that feeling, my body gets hot
I'm on the top
I can't stop I need some healing
I'm wound up, huh!
I'm on the top
I feel real hot
I'm on the top
You're my job
I'm on the top
Working you hard
I'm on the top
Feel my body heat
I'm on the top
When I get that feeling...

// Don't Break My Heart //

Don't break my heart (don't break it)

Don't (baby, baby, baby)
Don't break my heart, I can't take it
Don't...

// Nobody Knows //

Startin' out on my own
Away from home
New place, new style
People I don't know

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

I may not have clothes like you
But they are new
You may be better than me
But who are you?

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Startin' out on my own
Away from home
New place, new style
People I don't know

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Damn right
Nobody knows

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Nobody knows at all
That I've got class

Nobody knows who I am
Nobody knows about my secret life

// Don't Let Go //

Here we are
Living our dreams
Wrapped in each other's hearts
You and me

Sufferin' loss
Look what you've done to me
You set my heart free
With your love

So don't let go
And I need you so, so much
Darling no
Don't let go
Don't let go of me

Here we are
Wrapped in each other's love
Nothing like this before
I let her go

So through our love
You brought it back to me
So soft and mellowy
Some thing you do

So don't let go
And I need you so, so much
Oh no
Don't let go

Don't let go of me

So, so much
Don't let go of me

// Let's Get Together //

Oh, yeah!
Yeah-eah!

Everybody is looking, we don't wanna see
Life is so much better, living in a fantasy
We all need to wake up, we've been asleep too long
Everybody, let's get together, before it's all gone

Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get to-gether!

Oh yeah!
Ye-ah!
Yeah-eah-eah!

People, don't we realize, don't we give a damn (damn)
Aren't we really interested in the brotherhood of men?
Has it gotten to the point, giving no return? (Yeah)
It's not too hard to get together, but we try and learn

Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get to-gether!

Now everybody all over, you know we need to look
'Cause history repeats itself, it's written in the book
Think about each other, help a fellow man (why not?)
Is that so hard to do? Reach out a helping hand (Yeah)

Yeah! Let's keep together!
Let's keep together!
Let's keep together!
Let's keep to-gether!

Oh yeah!
Ye-ah!
Yeah-eah-eah!

Get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everywhere, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Time to care, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Nod to keep, let's get together now! (The more we get together, together, together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
Who-oho! Everywhere, let's get together now! (The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
(The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
(The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)

// Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) //

Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Things start shakin'
I begin to run

Bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle
I was on the top

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Stiff all in the collar
Struck me in the face
Chit-chat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many things on my mind
Words in the way

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Dance to the music
All night long
Everyday people
Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama starts to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try (you can make it if you try)

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Screamin' eyes of people's fear
Burning into you
Many men are missing nights
Hatin' what we do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Taken for a starter
Dying young is hard to take
Selling out is harder

Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
