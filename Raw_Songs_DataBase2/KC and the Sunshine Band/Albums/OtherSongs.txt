// Do Me //

It's midnight, the moon is full and shining bright
All I can think of is being with you tonight
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

Oh, girl, you're hot, hot to try
Sexy baby, ooh, a foxy lady
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

I can't wait
No, no, no, ugh
I can't wait any longer
No, no, no, ooh

It's midnight, the moon is full and shining bright
All I can think of is being with you tonight
Do me, groove me, do what you want to
Take me and hold me, and do whatever you like

Do what you want to, to me, move me
Do whatever you like (do me)
Do what you want to take me, hold me
And do whatever you like
Oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
I can't wait (any longer)
I can't wait any longer (to do)
I can't wait

Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like

I can't wait any longer, no, no, no (do me)
I can't wait any longer (do whatever you like), no, no, no
I can't wait any longer, no, no, no
I can't wait any longer, no, no, no, oh

Just do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me, do whatever you like
Do me, move me, do what you want to
Take me, hold me (all night), do whatever you like

So j-j-j-j-just do me, so j-j-j-j-just do me

// Give Me Some More (Aye Yai Yai) Give Me Disco RMX //

I like it I love it 
Can't get enough of it 
Oh give me some more
Turn off the lights
Clothes to the floor
This thing that we're feeling
Just can't be ignored 

The more that you love me
Kiss me touch me
You have me wanting you
When I'm near you 
It feels so good
I could get addicted to you

Where we have never been 
Living the dream havin' a good time 
In the heat of thew night you 
You got me sayin

As lights fill the night 
Things start to ignite
I can feel the heat 
Of your love

Take me wherever
You want to go 
I'll do anything 
You can think of

// Put A Little Love In Your Heart //

Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart

You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by
Still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart

If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (And the world) will be a better place
All the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (And me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see, wait and see

Take a good look around
And if you're looking down
Put a little love in your heart

I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart

And the world (And the world) will be a better place
And the world (And the world) will be a better place
For you (For you) and me (And me)
You just wait (Just wait) and see

People now, put a little love in your heart
Each and every day
Put a little love in your heart
There's no other way
Put a little love in your heart
It's up to you
Put a little love in your heart
Come on and
Put a little love in your heart
You've got to
Put a little love in your heart

// Remember //

Remember way back when
You and I were friends
All the good times that we shared
We drank champagne and fine wines
(Champagne and fine wines)
Had plays of rain and sunshine (raining and sunshine)
Good times we shared
You and I (you and I)

And I learned from you (I learned from you)
And you learned from me (you learned from me)
It was so, so easy
(Remember?)

We love without musiness
Oh we love all seasons (seasons change)
It's funny that sometimes things would change
Love is strange (love is strange)

You know I love you say'll (I love you so)
But how's you feel?
You see because, you're leaving today (leaving today)
Wow, could you just turn it out? (tell me now, I need to know)

I learned from you (I learned from you)
Oh yes, you learned from me (you learned from me)
Was it so very easy
Remember? (Remember?)
Do you remember?

Remember way back when (oh remember)
You and I were friends
Remember the good times (oh yes)
That we shared
Champagne and the fine wines
Ohhh the rain and the sunshine (the sunshine)
Good times we had (oh yes, we did)
You and I (oh yes, we did)

I learned from you (oh yes, you did)
You learned from me (oh yes, I did)
It was easy (so easy), oh easy
(Remember?) Remember?

The walks in the park
The nights got the dark (remember)
When were holding each other (it was easy)
We were loving each other so very, very much
Do you remember? (remember?)
It was so easy, wasn't it? (it was easy)

Love is strange (remember)
I lost again
Never, never forget (it was easy)
Remember how long as you're now (remember)

"Underneath this stained last window
That's supposed to be a window, but is the window
Cool! I feel sweet, I feel yummy
I feel... stained
I feel eaten, beaten, ripped and torn
I feel marvelous, Dobbly"

// Romantica //

Tonight, we'll take it slow
And the moment will take control, ooh
It's love that we need
That we can't let it go

Na na na na na na na na na

The way I feel
Touches every emotion, yeah, ooh
And that look you're giving me
Tells me all I need to know

Oh yeah, in a beautiful way
Oh yeah, makes it such a beautiful day

Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Ooh ah ah
Ooh ah ah ah
Everlasting love
Filled with no regrets
And the meaning of love
Is designed to keep us together

Oh yeah, in a beautiful way
Oh yeah, makes it such a beautiful day

Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come with me
Let this be a night to remember

Romantica
Come with me
Be with me endlessly
Let's get
Romantica
Come
With me
Let this be a night to remember
