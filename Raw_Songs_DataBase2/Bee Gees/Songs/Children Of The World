Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are searchers of the truth
Every man's a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it
There ain't no easy way

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Asking every question why
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
There ain't no easy way

In the back of your mind, there is always a mark
There's a wandering soul all alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changing my life, changing your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
