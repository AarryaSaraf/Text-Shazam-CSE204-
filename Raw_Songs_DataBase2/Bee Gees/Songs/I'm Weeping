When I was 10 years old
My parents were poor
Our house was so cold
And I was still in school and learning

And then I never really got too far
And everyone we knew had money
And driving a car and driving a car

Now I'm twenty-one
The street where I lived
Is blown-up and gone
And I've had a good day crying

And the world around has changed a lot
I never really gave much more
Much more than I got
Much more than I got
