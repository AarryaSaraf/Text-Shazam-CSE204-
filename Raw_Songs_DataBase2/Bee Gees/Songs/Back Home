Took a plane to Cairo
Then a Cessna to Rome
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv
And it's the first time that I've flown

But I've found my Shangri-La
In a place that's not too far
Back home

Took a train to Jordan
And to Texas and back
I met Lyndon B. Johnson
And I felt his hand on my back

But I found my Shangri-La
In a place that's not too far
Back home

Back home, back home
Back home, back home
Back home, back home
