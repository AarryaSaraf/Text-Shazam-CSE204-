When I was young
We walked to school
And I carried your books
'Cause even then I was a fool
But you grew up and said, "Goodbye."
I still remember the things that made me cry

For all too soon
My story ends
I found a love
Now not even friends
Why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child

I held your hand and I told you things
And I made you believe
Believe in fairy tales
And diamond rings

Then all too soon my story ends
I found a love now not even friends
Tell me why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child
