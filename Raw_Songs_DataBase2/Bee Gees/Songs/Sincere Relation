George was born somewhere
Inside London town
Working as he grew
For that extra pound
Respected by all
He married and made a home
To give his children
More than he had known

But then he died
Without an explanation
He never lied
A very sincere relation

Years before a fire
Sent him in the street
It took him months of work
To make ends meet

But then he died
Without an explanation
He never lied
A very sincere relation
