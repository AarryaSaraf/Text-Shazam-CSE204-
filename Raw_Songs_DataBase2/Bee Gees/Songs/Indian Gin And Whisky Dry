All day, all night
You feel as if the earth could fly
Three more all for fine
Indian gin and whisky dry
Fine Indian gin and whisky dry

Small town, closed down, there's nowhere else around to try
Disturbingly a voice would cry
"Go home, no loan, you'll have you gin and whisky dry
You'll have your gin and whisky dry"

Four, ten, four men, lining up for their handy brandy
All's gone, you're none, came the bartender's reply
But I've tried and I'm tied
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry
To Indian gin and whisky dry
