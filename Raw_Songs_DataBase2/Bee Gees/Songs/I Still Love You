Close your eyes do what you wanna
Baby, how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul that's born to be free

And cries to the wind, waiting for you
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me

I still love you
(Ah)
I still love you
(Ah)

Though you're my imagination
You'll be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy nights, out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
There's a bright new star when somebody dies

I cry to the wind, waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

I still love you (I still love you, I still love you)
(Ah) (Ah girl)
I still love you (I love you, I love you)
(Ah)

I'll be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ah) (Oh)
I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ah) (Oh girl)
I still love you (I still need you girl)
(Ah) (Oh girl)
I still love you (Love you, love you, love you)
(Ah)
I still love you
(Ah)
