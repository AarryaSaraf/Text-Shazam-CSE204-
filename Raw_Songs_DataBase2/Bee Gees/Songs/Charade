Summer nights
We made our love in the sand
And at the dawn
We held our love hand in hand
And we listened
To music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can hear

Let us ride on the wind
While this moment is real
You're the light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Knowing you blessed me forever
And believing
I have been touched by your love

And the pleasure of knowing
That evening won't tear us apart

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Of knowing you've blessed me forever

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Knowing you've blessed me forever

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade
