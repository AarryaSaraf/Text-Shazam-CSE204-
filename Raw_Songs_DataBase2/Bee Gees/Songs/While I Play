I cry tears of emotion
To spread across the U.S.A.
Ain't no sunshine cowboy
In your pockets
I'll make my own way while I play

Baby you forgot you're living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least I'm giving
What I love, am I wise?

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I am my father's son
Or that is what I heard
Maybe I got it wrong
I didn't mean a word
You got my face and I'll play your ace
Pretend I haven't heard

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, oh while I play

I am a minstrel
That is all I want to be
I'll play inside your soul
I'll show you to yourself
I'll fill your head with wild emotions
A symphony in wealth

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I will take my leave
I gotta move on time
I played inside your soul
I made you sing along
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play, while I play
