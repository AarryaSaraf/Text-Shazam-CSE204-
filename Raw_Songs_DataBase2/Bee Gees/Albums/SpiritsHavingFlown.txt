// Tragedy //

Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time in a world of tears, I slowly drown
Goin' home, I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere
Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Night and day, there's a burning down inside of me, aah
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go, and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere
(Aah) Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere
Aah

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere
(Aah) Tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Aah, tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere
(Aah) Aah, tragedy
When you lose control and you got no soul, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one beside you, you're goin' nowhere

Aah, tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why, it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're goin' nowhere
Aah, tragedy

// Too Much Heaven //

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Than my life..

I can see beyond forever
Ev'rything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world.. a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
You're my life..

I can see a new tomorrow
Ev'rything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to cross

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

// Love You Inside Out //

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

// Reaching Out //

Watching every day go by, living in a foolish game
Just the way I feel today living my life without you
Never hear a single word, living in a lullaby
Praying every tear I cry living my life without you

And everywhere you go I fly
(I love you with a special feeling)
And darling till the day I die
(Baby never stop believing)

I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman goin' through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me )
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever, forever

Watching every day go by living on the one I love
What I got is not enough living my life without you

And I believe in yesterday
(Yesterday was once tomorrow)
With love, with love wide open every way
(Baby you're the light I follow)

I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman going through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me)
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever
I'll be reaching out I'll be reaching out
Reaching out I'll be reaching out
Living my life forever

Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out

// Spirits (Having Flown) //

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Ah

I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

Faster than lightening is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?

You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

You'll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
I'd like to take you to my Shangri-La
Neither here or far
Away from home
Never before
Having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?

You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there

There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flown

// Search, Find //

Don't let the day keep movin' on with tears and pride
They hide the sun
Look to the road that lies ahead
I'm turnin' to the dream we left to die
Dyin' alone, cry for the moment you passed me by
Baby I don't now how, I'm only cryin' now

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Don't lose the will to make it right

A day is just a brighter night
And from the flames, a dyin' love can learn to fly
And rise above in me
All that we are, you are the heart of my everything
Maybe I lose my mind, I'm not the losin' kind

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find
No man, no god, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all its glory
Search, find

// Stop (Think Again) //

From daybreak to sunset you are the heart of me
Saying what you don't really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Lost in my pain, that where I lie

You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to lose
You gotta stop, think again, before you lost the heaven
Stop, baby one of us got to try

Oh, it's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to try

Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
That loves you like he loves you, only more
Birds cry, my sky falls
Darkness becomes my life, he got you
I got nothing to be living for

Oh, it's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again before you give it to him
Stop, baby one of us, one of us, one of us
You got to stop, think again before you lose the heaven
Stop baby one of us got to try

// Living Together //

Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone

I lay my heart on you and you can show the way
I give my everlasting love until my dying day
Take this lonely soul, the water or the wine
A chance to make you mine
I lay my body on the line

Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone

My life was emptiness until you came along
I nearly fell apart, you took my heart and made me strong
I need all of you to get me through the night
A chance to see the light
I lay my body on the line

Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone
Why ain't we livin' together instead of bein' alone

Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we livin', livin' together instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone
Why ain't we livin' together, livin' together instead of bein' alone

Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein so so far apart
Why ain't we livin' livin' together instead of bein' so so far apart

// I'm Satisfied //

With you, baby, I'm satisfied, making my love to you
'Cause you got me hypnotized

And you came to me alone, girl
I was a heart that's made of stone, girl
And you broke it down in pieces
And you took me for your own, girl

I lie beneath your ecstasy
You can pour it all over me
I won't break the chains of loving you

We got everything, anybody needs
And it's here with me, with you

Baby, I'm satisfied, making my love to you
(Making my love, making my love)
'Cause you got me hypnotized

Before you took me by the hand, girl
I was a statue in the sand, girl
I was broken down for reasons
You could never understand, girl

I was living on desire
But that was just the way we were
'Til you make a world of love in you

We got everything, anybody needs
And it's here with me, with you

Baby, I'm satisfied, making my love to you
'Cause you got me hypnotized

Anytime you wander, get yourself back to me, girl
Any cloud you're under, you got to get yourself free, girl
Ah, ah, baby, with you

Baby, I'm satisfied, making' my love to you
'Cause you got me hypnotized, oh, baby, with you

Baby, I'm satisfied, making' my love to you
'Cause you got me hypnotized, oh, baby, with you

// Until //

You were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And I knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
And every lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make
We held our love and that held our hearts

Until, until, ooh

Ah
