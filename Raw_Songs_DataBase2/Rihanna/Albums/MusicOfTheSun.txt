// Here I Go Again //

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-oh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again

Sweet loving is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss them days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within

It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again

I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again

Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together forever

// The Last Time //

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes (Ever will deceive these eyes)
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies (Hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear (Make it clear)
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (Ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time (It's the last time)
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (Never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh

// Willing To Wait //

Baby, slow down
Just hear me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need to push
No need to rush
You know you had me from "hello"

When it comes to my heart, I don't play
Baby boy, can't you see the stop sign?
You're moving much too fast
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last

Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)

Boy, can't you see?
I'm not tryna be the girl who gets taken for a ride
You take your time, and you will find there's so much more to me inside
And you say there's no need to delay
You're telling me to trust you
Boy, you know I want to, baby
But my heart, it's so recently break
Before we take this very far, show me who you really are

Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind (I know, baby, baby, yeah, yeah)
I know this feeling is crazy (Crazy)
It's mutual, baby (Mutual, baby)
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)

Hey baby
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
And make this feeling last

Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Don't you know that it's getting late? (It's getting late)
And I know what's on your mind (And I know just what's on your mind, your mind, your mind, mind)
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual, baby
But we don't have to rush something real
We don't have to rush it
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time (Take our time)
Our time
Don't you know that it's getting late?

// Music Of The Sun //

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Listen, closely
Hear the music playing
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do
No need for questions
It's only for you

And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (The sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (The sun, yeah)

So real, so right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress (No need for stress)
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say

And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (Let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Music of the sun)
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let them go 'til we see the morning light (See the morning light)
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun (Of the sun, oh, yeah)

And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go

Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there (Let the rhythm take you there)
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun (Come and dance to the music of the sun)
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Let it take you far
Come and dance to the music of the sun
It'll take you far away, far away
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun

They think ita love, but a lust
That's why a bad gyal beside is a must for I bust
She's the angel of me conscious
Yo, yo, yo

Never thought that I could feel something so strong
I wanna hold onto this moment before it's gone
I wanna hold your body close, it's calling to me
And when I look into your eyes, I'm liking what I see
Boy, don't hold back from me

Whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know I can't fake it

Yo yo yo
Well, I'm back with the boys and I knowing that

Most of mea gyal them slide off easy like a thunderclap
When I see you from the back, you know me need all a dat
Yo, yo, yo

Don't even know your name
But this feels so right
It's like I've known you boy for all of my life
Don't need to say a word
We both understand
And my eyes are telling you
Catch me if you can
I'm falling faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late I can't slow down
No way we're ever gonna stop

I catch a rush, boy
Whenever we touch, I go crazy (I go crazy)
I'm feeling you baby

Whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know I can't fake it

And come a little close so you feel what I'm 'bout here
(No, I can't take it)
(No, I can't take it)
(No, no)
My girl turn it around bring it near
Let me show you a thing dat a done ya career

I'm falling faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late, I can't slow down
No way we're ever gonna stop

I catch a rush, boy
Whenever we touch, I go crazy

I trip like this boy
Whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know I can't fake it
I catch a rush, boy
Whenever we touch, I go crazy
I'm feeling you, baby

// There's A Thug In My Life //

Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lot of game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry

// Now I Know //

Took a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It's the way it's gotta be

Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it's wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know

Yeah, no no
Now I know
