Let's take a slow boat to China. Leave from South Carolina
Let's take our time and go the long way
On a junk boat to Thailand with your hand in mine hand
I sure hope we got something to say
Well, this old boat's go no sail so won't you please hold our mail-
For awhile
Thanks anyway pal but the Suez Canal -
Ain't our style

Let's take a slow boat to China and maybe we'll find a
New way to play those same old games
The stars just might show us and the captain will know us
Shake our hands and call us by our first names
We'll send a postcard to Grandpa of a vase or rickshaw-
He don't care
We'll buy Mom a kimono or maybe we'll just phone her -
When we're there

We'll drink sake at night beneath the soft harbor lights-
On the bay
We'll build house on the hill next to Shangri-Li Bill -
And we'll stay

Let's take that slow boat to China (Let's go)
Slow boat to China (Real Slow)
Slow boat to China (Let's go)
Slow boat to China (Real Slow)
Let's go Real Slow
