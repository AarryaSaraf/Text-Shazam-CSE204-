Where the blue of the night
Meets the gold of the day
Someone waits for me

And the gold of her hair
Crowns the blue of her eyes
Like a halo, tenderly
If only I could see her
Oh how happy I would be

Where the blue of the night
Meets the gold of the day
Someone waits for me

Where the blue of the night
Meets the gold of the day
Someone waits for me
