You got everything that a girl should grow
I'm so afraid to kiss you I might lose control
You can hold me tighter but turn loose of my gun
It's a sentimental present all the way from Saigon
Honey, Honey, Honey, please call me
You don't need no money we can do it for free
I got a friend in Phoenix with a two-way radio
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
All the static in my attic getting ready to blow

I was talking to the mailman late last week
He had a letter in his sweater from Stuttering Don
He said things are getting better in Sa, Sa, Sa, Sa, Sa

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon

Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Saigon, Honey, Honey, Honey
Things are getting better back in Saigon
