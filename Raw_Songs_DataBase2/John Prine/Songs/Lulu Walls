One evening getting dark
We first met at the park
Just sitting by the fountain all alone
I lifted up my hat
And then began to chat
She said she'd allow me to see her at her home


Such a star I've never seen
She's as pretty as the queen
She's as perfect as an angel from above
If she'd only be my wife
I'd live happy all me life
With that aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.

If she were only mine
I'd build a house so fine
And around it so many fences tall
It would make me jealously
To think that none but me
Could gaze upon that beauty Lulu Walls.



One evening getting late
Well, I met her at the gate
I asked her if she'd wed me in the fall
But she only turned away
And nothing would she say
That aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.



With that aggravating beauty Lulu Walls.
