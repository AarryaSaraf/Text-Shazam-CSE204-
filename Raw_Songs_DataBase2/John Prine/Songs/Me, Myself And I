Well, tonight I'll throw a party and I know who I'll invite
There's a strange and lonely person with whom I'll spend this night
There'll be no old sad memories to haunt me till I die
In that room there'll be a bottle
And me, myself and I
In that room there'll be a bottle
And me, myself and I

I've been introduced to many people I don't understand
I've been in the house of lonely. I've shook a thousand shaking hands
But tonight I'll be with someone who will look me in the eye
And in that room there'll be a bottle
And me, myself and I
In that room there'll be a bottle
And me, myself and I

At that party you'll see me when I was just a child
In a room full of happy with a heart so meek and mild
And that child will meet a ghost that will haunt him oh so bad
From a family of confusion pretending love they never had.

So, tonight I'll throw that party and I know just what I'll do
Yes, I'll meet myself at midnight and cry the whole night through
Yeah, I'll meet that ghost of sadness and he'll look me in the eye
And in that room there'll be that bottle
And me, myself and I
In that room there'll be a bottle
And me, myself and I
