I've come from just the other side of no-where,
To this big time lonesome town.
They got a lotta ice an' snow here,
Half as cold as all the people I've found.
Every way I try to go here,
Seems to bring me down.
I seen about enough to know where I belong.

I've got a mind to see the headlights shinin',
On that old white line between my heart and home.
Sick of spendin' Sundays, wishin' they were Mondays,
Sittin' in a park alone.
So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me,
Any lovin' way but wrong,
Tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's goin' home.

Takin' nothing back to show there,
For these dues I have paid,
But the soul I almost sold here,
And the body I've been givin' away.
Fadin' from the neon nightime glow here,
Headin' for the light of day.
Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home.
