Hey, there she goes
Well I though she'd never leave
Heaven knows
Well it sure gives me the creeps
You know I went and loved that woman
To the power of height
We both got jivin' fever
Screwed our heads uptight
Then it came to blows
Hey hey hey
There she goes.

Hey there she goes
Just a walkin' down the street
I suppose
The next fellow that she meets
Should have her head examined
By an x-ray machine
So he can see all of those pictures
That I've already seen
Just so he knows
Hey hey hey
There she goes.

Well, there must be something somewhere
That makes me want to hurt myself inside
Yeah, we were regular Dr Jekyll
But together
We were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
What a rough rough ride.

Hey there she goes
She's walking out on me
With all her clothes
Lookin' fine as she could be
Well, I seen her on down at the courthouse
I was sober as the judge
We'd tried to talk things over
But the grudge just wouldn't budge
I said adios
Hey hey hey
There she goes.
