I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most them Opry stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee

Milwaukee is where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery making the finest beer
You came to me on a payday night said let's go to Tennessee
So we drove to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opry

I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most those Opry stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee

We were watching TV Ernest Tubb was singing loud
I said that's the man for me I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving you and going now to find out where he's at
If I can't get him I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt.

I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most
Me or Jerry Lee
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee
