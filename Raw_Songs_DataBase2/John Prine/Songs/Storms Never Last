Storms never last do they baby
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine

I followed you down so many roads baby
I've picked wild flowers and sung you soft sad songs
And every road we took God knows
Our search was for the truth
And the storm brewing now won't be the last

Storms never last do they baby
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine

Storms never last do they Jessi
Bad times all pass with the wind
Your hand in mine stills the thunder
And you make the sun want to shine
