// Shop Talk //

I seen you in your pajamas
Drinking coffee at the House of Pies
You was flipping for the check
And talking like your tongue was paralyzed
You were saying something
That I don't understand
Bout looking other places
While you're holding my hand
Let's stop
Let's not
Talk shop
In front of all these guys

[Chorus:]
Let's not
Talk shop
Shop talk
Shop talk is talking something
That you don't realize

Loose lips sink ships, shake hips
Bad tips draw spies
I want you when I can get you
But you only want me on the rise
Well I thought I had your number
But your number's too loud
Now you're standing on the table
And we're drawing a crowd
Let's stop
Let's not
Talk shop
In front of all these spies

// Living In The Future //

Jehosaphat the mongrel cat
Jumped off the roof today
Some would say he fell but I could tell
He did himself away
His eyes weren't bright like they were the night
We played checkers on the train
God Bless his soul he was a tootsie roll
But he's a dead cat just the same

[Chorus:]
We are living in the future
I'll tell you how I know
I read it in the paper
Fifteen years ago
We're all driving rocket ships
And talking with our minds
And wearing turquoise jewelry
And standing in soup lines
We are standing in soup lines

Jake the barber's lonely daughter
Went down to her daddy's shop
She plugged herself to a barber pole
And took a little off the top
Pressure on the left. Pressure on the right
Pressure in the middle of the hole
I'm goin' to Maine on a forty foot crane
I'm gonna use it for a fishin' pole

[Chorus]

Old Sarah Brown sells tickets down
At the all night picture show
Where they grind out sex
And they rate it with an "X"
Just to make a young man's pants grow
No tops no bottoms just hands and feet
Screaming the posters out on the street
Strangling the curious and the weak
We give 'em what they want to see - O

[Chorus]

// It's Happening To You //

Well it's the same old song
Boy meets girl
And girl meets boy
They carry on
They close their eyes
And kiss until the world is gone
Oh yes it's true
It's happening to you

You know what they say
They pledge their love forever
Then they add a day
They hold their hands so tight
In the fear
That one might stray
Oh yes it's true
It's happening to you

I loved her
She loved me too
We had a lot of love
Now it's all through

And for a while
Their hearts beat one
As they match each other
Smile for smile
They dance away the night
As they praise
The others style
Oh yes it's true
It's happening to you

// Sleepy Eyed Boy //

Where are the boot straps
To lift myself up?
Where is the well
Where I once filled my cup?
Where does this sorrow
All turn into joy?
And where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy?

Where is my true love
When the wind starts to moan?
Is she out in the wild,
Is she there all alone?
Have I cast her aside
Like an unwanted toy?
Tell me where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy?

He's goin' down the backroads
In a cold pourin' rain
He's a waitin' for a postcard
In the south coast of Spain
Postmarked from a sweetheart
Back in ol' Illinois
Sayin' where oh where is my sleepy eyed boy?

// All Night Blue //

You've got a life somewhere without me
I've gone on without you
It hasn't been easy getting used to
Being lonely and tonight is an all night blue
And I wonder how you look and who looks at you
In your nightgown
I can almost feel your body
Your warm and loving body when I lay down

[Chorus:]
It's an all night blue
Remembering you
It's an all night blue
Wondering who's loving you... all night

Well it hurts me to see that you're
Happy without me cause I still need you
I just drank up my heart
Set it empty on the table 'cause I
Ain't got nothing better to do
Still I wonder how you look and
Who looks at you every morning
I can still feel your warm breath
You kissing me on the chest
I'm just dreaming

[Chorus]

// Just Wanna Be With You //

I got an airplane ticket
And my shirt is stickin' out of my jeans
You got me painted in the corner
Where I'm livin' way beyond my means
Outside my window
A bird once flew
Now I don't even care
What kind of gum I chew
And oh baby
I just wanna be with you

Well I don't wanna wash the dishes
But I'm wishin' I could wash my hair
You been on my mind so long
You must livin' up there
Well it's up to the circus
And down to the zoo
The monkey's lookin' at me
Like I'm lookin' at you
And oh baby
I just wanna be with you

I don't wanna go to London
To visit the Queen
She don't like my English
If you know what I mean
Don't wanna walk around
Like I got nothin' to do
Uh uh baby wanna be with you
Uh uh baby wanna be with you

Well I was cleaning out my wallet
While I'm sittin' on my livin' room rug
I was lookin' at the numbers of the women
That I thought I dug
There was one that begged
One that teased
One God blessed me
Every time I sneezed
But oh baby
I just wanna be with you

[Bridge:]
I wanna be with you
When there ain't no love
When the banks all close
With the stars above
Lonely won't be lonesome
When we get through
And uh uh baby wanna be with you
Uh uh baby wanna be with you

// Baby Ruth //

Well it's sure good to see you
But my how you've changed
Since the last time I saw you
Girl you've been rearranged
I always said your people
Were just like my kin
When I was down and out
They would always take me in

[Chorus:]
Oh I love you my Baby Ruth
Never lie to you
I only tell the truth
Oh I love you since you were a child
Every time I see you girl
You always raise a smile

I was living out on the highway
You didn't turn me out
I lived in your closet
And you fed me by mouth
My boots were my pillow
Wrapped under my head
I kept all my stuff
Stashed out under your bed

// One Red Rose //

The rain came down
On the tin roof
Hardly
A sound was left
From the birthday party
The kitchen light
Fell asleep
On the bedroom floor
Me and her were talking softer
Than all the time
Before I lost her
Picture sat on top
Of the chest of drawers

[Chorus:]
One red rose
In the Bible
Pressed between
The Holy alphabet
Probably wouldn't believe you
If you told me
But what I never knew
I never will forget

Rainy nights
Get dark real early
Her dress was soft
And her hair was curly
We danced around the table
To the old banjo
Rainy nights
Were made for lovers
We lay there still
Beneath the covers
And I ain't never felt
Like that before

[Chorus]

// I Had A Dream //

I had a dream last night
Last night I had a dream
Everything was black and white
And it smelled like gasoline
We stood in the corner
And I held you tight
I kissed your mouth
Till my head got light
Last night when I had a dream

I had a dream last night
Last night I had a dream
Birds were flying left and right
Thru the light of a movie screen
Everyone was looking
For something to do
I even thought
I had a chance with you
Last night when I had a dream
