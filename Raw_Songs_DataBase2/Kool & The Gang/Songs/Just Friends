Lady, we'll never pass this way again
so maybe now we can be friends
And still I know we tried to make it
but I can't stand the pain no more

(Never really lovers, just friends)
But we cannot hide this feeling inside
now I know for sure, we were just friends

You and me are just friends girl

Crazy to let this thing go wrong for so long
We got to find a way to be strong
But I longed to have you next to me
tough I know it's not the way it should be, oh no!

(Never really lovers, just friends)
Tell me girl is this the end, baby
(Never really lovers, just friends)
But we cannot hide deep down inside
now I know for sure that we were just friends

You and me, baby
(we're just friends)
we're just friends darling
(Never really lovers, just friends)
We will allways, allways be friends
(Never really lovers, just friends)
We're only friends now baby

Maybe one day we'll be together again
and maybe then be more than just friends
And still somehow we gotta make it
But I know it's not the way it would be, oh no, no, no, 
no, no...

(Never really lovers, just friends)
Tell me girl, is this the end
(Never really lovers, just friends)
I cannot hide this feeling inside
now I know for sure, we were just friends

(Friends)
We will allways be yeah, friends girl
Lovers no more
(We're just friends)
You and me
(Friends)
And I know that we tried to make it
(We're just friends)
So don't you worry 'cause I know
(Friends)
that everything, everything, everything, haha
(We're just friends)
everything's gonna be alright
(Friends)
Oh, yeah
Hmm, yeah
(We're just friends)
We're friends, just friends
