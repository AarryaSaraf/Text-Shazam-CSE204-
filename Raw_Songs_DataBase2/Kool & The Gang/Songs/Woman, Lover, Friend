Every man needs a woman who understands
When you need time to be alone
When you need a helping hand
A woman to love, and woman who'll love you back
One who's faithful, honest, loyal, and true
Baby, that someone is you

And I'm so glad I've got you in my life today
You're all these things rolled into one
And I'm so proud to say -


That you are my woman
My lover, and you are my friend
And I'll do anything for you, Baby
You are my woman
My lover, and you are my friend

When I get home, you're waiting there for me
With open arms and a kiss "hello"
The moment that I hit the door -
Dinner is ready, I hear water running in the bath
And when you're dressed in your favorite lingerie
I know what you want, you don't have to say

Baby Girl, I'm happy, and I'll do anything for you
'Cause we've got something special
That I don't want to lose




My friend - Baby, Baby
You are my woman, you are my friend
My friend - Baby, Baby
My lover, my friend





You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
