At seventeen we fell in love
High school sweethearts
Love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we prayed
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, girl
When you lose

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago
You were my love
Oh, my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl
And in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, girl
When you lose

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling the pain

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we made

it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes, it's so hot
I can't take it
I can't stand no more, baby
We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
We're man and wife forever
Whoooooooooa (too hot)
Whoooooooooa
Baby (too hot)
Baby, please won't you listen (too hot)...
