Last night, I overheard you talk
To Jesus in your yard
Looked at the sky with tears in your eyes
Never heard you pray so hard
Tonight is a different night
You can't take it anymore
Packed up your bags and took what you need
Left a note by the door

And, oh, you just keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean
God will find you
And, oh, you just keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean
God will find you
God will find you out, find you out

Today, I saw a man
Just wandering in the street
His clothes were old, his face was weary
No shoes on his feet
I thought about how you were
And wondered where you'd be
I only hope and pray to God
You were better off than he

You can't keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean, yeah
God will find you
Oh, you just keep running and running
God will find you
God will find you out
God will find you out
He will find you out

Mmm, yeah

Someday, you are gonna feel
A change in your heart
'Cause you were living the kind of life
That is bound to fall apart
And while you were tumbling down
God will recall your prayers
'Cause you will find out that in this life
He's the only One who cares

You can't keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean, yeah
God will find you
Ooh, no, it doesn't matter where you try to hide
God will find you
And it doesn't matter what you feel inside
God will find you

He will find you out, whoo!
God will find you
La-da-da-da-da...
God will find you
He will find you out
God will find you
Oh, there ain't no mountain He can't climb
God will find you
And we're running, running
Running, running out of time
God will find you
He will find you out
God will find you
God will find you out
God will find you...
