You told me that you were over him
No longer lovers - not even friends
You gave me your guarantee
When you gave your heart to me - forever

Lately, Baby, you've been acting strange
It seems that your heart has been rearranged
When we make love you're not there
I catch you staring in the air
Just going through the motions -
That's why I question your devotion


Are you having second thoughts?
Are you thinking about the one, girl
That you lost?
Are you having second thoughts?

I heard you calling out someone's name
While you were sleeping right next to me
You say it's only a dream
And you don't remember a thing -
But that's not the first time that it happened -
Girl, that sounds a bit suspicious to me


Are you having second thoughts?
Are you thinking about the love, Girl,
That you lost?
Are you having second thoughts?
Are you wishing that you would've made
Another choice?




Than the one that you made -
Are you thinking that I'll use you
And then walk away?
Was it something I said
Or something I did?
Tell me baby -
Make me understand
