All the little children
Happy little children
Playing, laughing
Your world is so bright
All the little children
Happy little people
In a world of lollipops
And lemon candy drops

(Grow) All the little children
(You better pick up that teddy bear)
(Grow) Delight, little lollipop
(Yeah, I'm gonna come over there and get you)
(Grow) All the little children
(Yes, yes, yes, that is the thing)
(Grow) Sweet as a lemon drop
(Grow) All the little children
(Grow) All the same
(Mm-hmm, sweet as a lemon drop)
(Grow) All the little children
(Funky, yes, indeed, yeah)

Grow on, sweet children
Discover the things you are
Keep laughing and learning
And jumping and playing
And reaching for the stars

All the little children
Happiness surrounds you
In your fairytale land
Of gingerbread men
All the little children
Just like little flowers
Growing in a field of love
With sugar skies above

(Grow) All the little children
(All the little children, yeah)
(Grow) Delight, little lollipop
(You all know you're sweet)
(Grow) All the little children
(Grow) Sweet as a lemon drop
(Grow) All the little children
(Come on now, come on)
(Grow)
(Keep on playin', little children)
(Grow) All the little children
(Come on, now, y'all gotta get down)
(Y'all know)

Rainbows sparkle in your eyes
Circusland lies in your mind
Happy little people
Friendly little people
Special little people you are

All the little children
Special little people
Hopscotch, jump-rope
Hide-and-go-seek
All the little people
Living in a world
Where only children can live

Keep growing and laughing
And reaching for the stars

All the little children
Happy little children
In a garden of love
All the little children
Their dreams are filled
With rainbow skies
And pretty butterflies
The dance before your eyes

Keep growing and learning
And reaching for the stars
