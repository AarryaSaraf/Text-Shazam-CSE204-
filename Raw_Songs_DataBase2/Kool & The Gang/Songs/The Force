Ow!

A long time ago
In a place not far away (well)
Everybody partied
Very hearty everyday (uh-huh)
They all danced real funky
And they got down all the time (yeah)
Singin' songs of glory
Telling stories with a rhyme

There's somebody dancin'
Now the power got a source
They told us it was funk
And they got it from the force
You could feel it in the air
You could feel it everywhere (uh-huh)
And they danced all night
Till the early morning light

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Can you, yow!

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Can you, let's get on down

Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow

Don't force the funk
Just let it flow
But feel the force
Then you'll all know
You can't force the funk
You got to let it flow
Well, then get on down and let go

Feel the force
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Yow!
Just get on down

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Yow!
Let's get on down

Feel it!
Feel the force

Feel it!
Feel the force...
