Straight ahead straight ahead
Let's go straight ahead to straight ahead
Straight ahead, come on straight ahead
Movin' straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead
Straight ahead

So you started from the bottom
But you always saw the light
And now you're ready for your journey
One direction reachin' high

Keep the feeling of the spirit
Always present as you climb
One direction, one vibration
That's the message let us try

Straight ahead, keep movin'
Movin' straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead

Keep the feeling of the spirit
Always present as you climb
One direction, one vibration
That's the message
You can make it if you try

Keep movin' straight ahead
Straight ahead
Movin' straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead in love
Let's go, let's go

Keep the spirit high
And your heart in love
Keep on movin'
Keep the spirit high
And your heart in love

Keep your head above
And your heart in love
Keep on movin'

Keep your head above
And your heart in love
Keep your feelings now
Keep moving straight ahead
Straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead
