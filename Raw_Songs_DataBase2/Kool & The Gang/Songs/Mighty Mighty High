Don't give in to lower vibes
It will get you every time

Time is now and now is time
Time to rise to higher vibes

Everyone around the world
The time has finally come
The people of the planet Earth
We all must live as one
All for one and one for all
In peace and harmony
Come together, one another
For eternity, think about it

Well
Oh-oh-oh-whoa...
Well

It's time for us to understand
Just what's in the master plan
We was placed on Earth to be
Masters of creation, see
Life began for us to grow
Peace and love we all must show
The question's asked to make it clear
Where do we all go from here?

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, whoa-oh-oh-oh...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, whoa...

Everybody, sing together

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow

Be true to yourself and self will be
True to you and we will see
Self is what we ought to be
Be yourself and you will see
Open up your ears, you'll hear
Knowledge of this atmosphere
Universal consciousness
Is the word that is the best

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow...
