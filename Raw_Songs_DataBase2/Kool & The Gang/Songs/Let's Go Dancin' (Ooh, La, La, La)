Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'

I went down to the park - everything was dark, oh yeah
All of a sudden on came the lights and everything was feelin' right
The people started dancin' - they call me over to join in
They said "J.T. - Don't you feel good man?
Come on and join the reggae jam." - I heard them singin'

Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'

I wanna get to know you. Come on, let's reggae down, oh yeah
Get better acquainted, so that everything will be fine. Hey baby
Hey baby, what's your name? Is it a Missis or a Miss, eh?
If you're by yourself, I'd like to take you for a ride
We could check the scene and we can reggae down
And we'll be singing

Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'

Ooh la la la, ooh, let's go dancin'
Get your dancin' shoes, get your dancin' shoes, reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, ooh, let's go dancin'
Go get your dancin' shoes, get your dancin' shoes, reggae dancin'

It's a special occasion, such a happy occasion
It's a special occasion, such a happy occasion

You wanna come dancin'? Let's go dancin'reggae dancin'
Do you wanna come dancin'? Let's go dancin'reggae dancin'
It's special occasion, such a happy occasion
