Here we are
Back in love again
This time unlike before
You and I
Giving so much more
Learning what it means
To really love someone
To trust in love

Sharing life as one
In a special way

Time be still
Listen to my heart
It's beating strong and clear
And so fast
Yes, it's love, you know
Filling empty days
That now seem so long ago
We found love

Trusting in each other
In a special way
(In a special way)
Oh oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

I know miracles
Do come true
The moment
I laid my eyes on you
(So beautiful)
That love has shown us
That special way
To love
To hold each other
In a special way
(Special way)

(So beautiful)
To love
To hold each other

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way
