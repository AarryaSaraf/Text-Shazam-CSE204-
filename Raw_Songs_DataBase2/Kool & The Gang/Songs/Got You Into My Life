I open my eyes
And I finally realize
I got you in my life
And the loneliness dies

You brighten my days
In so many ways
I got you
I got you
I got you girl
I got you
I got you girl

You started these spark
That put love in my heart
With you in my life
All the loneliness passed

And you make me feel
So very real
I'm so glad I got you girl
I got you
I got you baby
Yeah yeah yeah

Never go away my sweet
It's your love I need
Stay here by my side
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
So 'til the end tonight

There was a time
When love was not mine
Though I searched everywhere
I just couldn't find
A love that was real, a love I could feel
So real...never go away...

Never go away my sweet
'Cause it's your love I need
Stay here by my side
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
Oh wee baby
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
So 'til the end tonight

There was a time
When love was not mine
I searched everywhere
But I just couldn't find
A love that was real, a love I could feel
So real...never go away...

You started this spark
That put love in my heart...yeah
With you in my life all the loneliness passed
And I wanna thank you baby
Fulfilling my life, yeah
Can't you feel me

Oh wee baby

Never go away...
Always..always..always..always..by my side
Because I feel it everyday feel it everyday
