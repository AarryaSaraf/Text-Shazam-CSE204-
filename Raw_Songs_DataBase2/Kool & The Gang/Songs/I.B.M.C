Everybody, please rise
It's rhythm music time
Open up the door and spread the word
Round the sheeps in the meadow
The captains on the throne
This quiet place they call home
That's where they're making rhythm music
All night long, yeah
Spread the word, uh!

Down at Central Street Park
Everybody's chilling
Looking for excitement and romance, well
Everybody gather 'round
We want to rock this town
Just listen to the beat
It's a real fine beat
It's an I.B.M.C. treat
Oh, making rhythm music all night long, yeah
Spread the word, uh!

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
I.B.M.C

When your body starts to shake
Hungry for a taste of the rhythm
Just listen to me, don't call the doctor
'Cause she can't help you
You need a cure and we've got the beat
It's I.B.M.C. music, ow!

Where music can be found, yeah

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world, ooh...

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world

MIDI
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world...
