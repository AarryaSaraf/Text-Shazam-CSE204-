Alright!

Love the life you live
So you can live the life you love
Let's try to get along
Let's everyone forgive, yeah

Time will not wait
It's not too late
To open the gate

Love your life and live your life

Love the life you live
So you can live the life you love
Let's try to get along
Let's everyone forgive, yeah

Life's not a dream
So it may seem
Wake up and see

Whoo!
Love your life, live your life

Yeah!
Ooh, that funky mama!
Whoo!

Whoo!
Get down!
