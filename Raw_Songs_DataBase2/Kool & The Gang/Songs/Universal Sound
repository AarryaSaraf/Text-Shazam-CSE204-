Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen

Everybody gather here
We've got something for your ears
Listen to the sonic sound
It will make your heart a-pound
Playing music just for you
This is what we wanna do
Sing along if you can
Hoping that you'll understand

In the universal sound
Everybody gets down

Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen, listen, listen

In the universal sound
Everybody gets down
In the universal sound
Everybody gets down
In the universal sound
Everybody gets down
