Here comes the fruitman,
Bringing fruit from the land
Here come the fruitman, 
Bringing vegetables from the land

When you see the fruit truck come through
The Fruitman always asks you
What can I, I do for you
I have watermelons, red ripe tomatoes
Apples and oranges, Idaho potatoes

So look and see what you see
I only bring things naturally
You know you gotta eat to live
So your body can give you more to give
So eat naturally, and you will see the difference
