We don't feel like talking
There's nothing to be said
I guess it's just confusion
Rolling 'round our heads

Still we know there's love here
We just can't work it out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

We had a love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?

'Cause I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Of Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones
It's me and

You believed in me once
Girl, I believed in you
And, and woman
Who loves so beautiful

Still we know there's loving
We just can't work it out
When the hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
September never seemed so cold
Where in the world did love go?

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones

I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Of Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you

Always did believed in, baby
All this love is now so crazy
Jones vs. Jones
Mr. and Mrs. Jones

So here is where we let go
So here is where we step out
The hardest part of all day
Is breaking up, breaking up and out

Always will believe in, baby
Who's to blame for a name that's changing?
I just can't believe it, baby
Goodbye, baby
Jones vs. Jones

I just can't believe it, baby
It's all over but the memories
I just can't believe it, baby
I can't believe it

Jones vs. Jones
I just can't believe it, baby
Goodbye baby
