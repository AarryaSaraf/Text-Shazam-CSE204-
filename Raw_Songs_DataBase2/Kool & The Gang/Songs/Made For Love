I thank the Lord that I've got you
Girl, you know you've always been the strength of me
Got my back when I'm down
Keep my head off the ground

Never messed around, didn't never change
Kept my love when I was going through some things
Now the years have gone by and I'm sure
'Coz you're still right here, now I know

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us
I'm the only one you need 'coz I need you

Can I take time out to express myself?
I don't wanna be with no one else, no
Does it matter what you cannot do?
'Coz if I got it, girl, you know you got it too

You can rest assure, you got my support
If you really hurting, lean on me, I'll lift you up
It's whatchu done for me, is how I feel
I would give my life and then 

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us
I'm the only one you need 'coz I need you

Listen baby, temptations come, temptations go
You're the one I wanna know
Baby, you're my thick and thin
You're my now, baby, you're my then

You can rest assure 'bout us
'Coz in that I trust
That we'll be together
Always so in love

When I'm away from you
You're still right there with me
Always in my heart
Girl, you're one with me

Play with your love
I'm only playing myself
We were meant for each other
Girl, there's no one else

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us
I'm the only one you need

'Coz I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
