Ha! Whoo!
Alright!
Doin' the do, doin' the do
That's all I do
Lookie here!

I get up in the morning
I work nine to five
I work real hard
Just tryin' to survive
The children say, "hey, daddy
We got somethin' to say
You've been workin' real hard
You need a break today", alright

You deserve a break today
(Take a vacation)
Get on up and get away
(Have a little fun)
You deserve a break today
(Out there in the country, son)
Get on up and get away

Break it on down
Got to break it on down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Doin' the do, doin' the do
That's all I do
Gotta get this thing off my back

Oh, my children was right
I finally saw the light
I went to a party
And I boogied all night
I say to myself
Hey, it's not too bad
I'm havin' the best time
I ever had, alright, now

You deserve a break today
(Doin' the do, look at me)
(I'm gettin' down)
Get on up and get away
(I'm happy as I can be)
You deserve a break today
(Alright, alright, hey)
Get on up and get away

(I ever had, get on down)

Break it on down
Got to break it on down
