Pass the love on

There's so many things we have, we shared for so long
Now the time has come for us to pass it on
Little children come, they go so fast
Let us teach them well so that this world can last

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on 
To their hearts and minds, pass the love on 
To their souls, pass the love on
To the little children, pass it on

So many good hearts born to do great things
To help us feel the music that this life can bring
So many came before as brighter stars
To show us what was alive and show us who we are

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on
From your heart and mind, pass the love on
From your soul, pass the love on
Through the generations, pass it on

Pass it on, pass the love on
In your heart and mind, pass the love on
In your soul, pass the love on
In your mind, baby, pass it all

And every child will know just to live on
They were born for greater things to be stars
As generations come and go so fast
The love we leave are less than that we last

So baby, pass it on, pass the love on
In your heart and mind, pass the love on
In your soul, pass the love on
For the little children, pass the love on

Pass the love, oh baby, yeah
Pass the love on
You would feel so much better if you share it
Pass the love on
Through all the ages and time, oh yeah
Pass it all, pass the love on
