Come on, let's get down, get right on down
Come on, let's get down, get right on down

Let's dance, let's shout
Let's get on down to the funky sounds
Let's dance, let's shout, come on!

Everybody get down to the funky sounds
In a funky time and a funky place in space

We are all your shining stars
In a universe of peace and harmony
Let your spirits be free
There's no place in space for you and me
Hit me!

Get down on Mars and other stars
(Whoop, whoop-whoop)
So come on, let's get down on this planet of ours
Groove to the music, ride with the times
Dance to the music, now's the time

Everybody rejoice and sing a song
We've come so far on this old star today
Come on, let's get high on peace and love
Sharin', sharin' like that is the way
I like it

Get down on Mars and other stars
(Whoop, whoop-whoop)
So come on, let's get down on this planet of ours
Groove to the music, ride with the times
Dance to the music, now's the time

Come on, let's get down to the funky sounds
In a funky time and a funky place in space
Everybody get up, and get away
There's no place in space today, come on!

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now, so then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Let's dance, let's shout
Let's get on down to the funky sounds
Let's dance, let's shout, come on!

Come on, y'all, get down, get right on down
Come on, let's get down, get right on down

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you...
