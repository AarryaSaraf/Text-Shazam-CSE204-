Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Now we find each other
In a search that never ends
All I wanted was a lover
But in you I find a friend
How'd we find that someone
In a world that's so untrue
I'm so glad my search is over
For I found true love in you
Oh, yes, I have

You had given up on
All the finding other men
One that wasn't playing games with love
And one who could understand
The mysteries of a woman
And the things you all go through
But my search is finally over
For I found true love in you

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
You're the one I've waited on
And when I hold half the peace inside
My heart makes me know that, ooh...
I found true love in you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Think of all the changes
That our search for love can take us through
Whoa, I know lately I traveled
Down the road that led me to you, yeah
Now my search is over
And I know just what to do
I'm gonna hold you tight
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with you
With you, you, you, you, you

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
Let us stay together from now on

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
You're the one I've waited on
And when I hold half the peace inside
My heart makes me know that, ooh...
I found true love in you
Found true love in you

I don't want nobody else
To satisfy myself I found in you
Oh, I found true love in you
