I walked (I walked and walked)
Like a zombie in the night
You came (you came, you came)
And you brought me back to life
I tried so hard (I tried, I tried)
To become the one you need
But now you think that you're not enough for me

You don't have to change for me
I love you just the way you are
I'd rather change the sun and the moon
Or see December's snow in June
