People, the world today is in a very difficult situation
And we all know it because we're the ones to created it
We're gonna have to be the ones to clean it up
We're gonna have to learn to live together and love each other

Because I believe one day someone or something
Is gonna wanna judge who's creating
All this corruption and death and pollution
And all these difficult situations on earth

And He's gonna wanna know
Who's gonna take the weight

Who's gonna take the weight
I don't know, I don't know
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight

Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight
Who's gonna take the weight
