Reunited 'cause love lifts us higher on wings of our love, we've gone through the fire
Reunited 'cause love lifts us higher on wings of our love, we've gone through the fire

All the loves that life takes us through I find my heart coming back to you.
Girl for so long I played the fool.
I see clearly now, your love is true



You by my side, I feel so strong.
Girl you and I stayed apart so long.
Your loving heart knows that I'm true.
My love is real, I'm right for you.



Take my hand, girl we're blessed
In this life that we live.
Everyday I thank God for the love that you give.
