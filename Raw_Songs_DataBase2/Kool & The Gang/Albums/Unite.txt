// Better Late Than Never //

I finally realized that I was wrong
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, baby
I wanna make it right before you're gone
I'd be so lonely, yes, I would, yes, I would
And what a price to pay
For all those nights and days
That we had spent together trying to hold on
A moment of confusion and a lifetime of regret
A chance that I'd be losing
The best that's happened yet, oh...

Better late than never
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
We're gonna work things out
Yes, we are, yes, we are, yeah
Better late than never, ooh...
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
Better late than never, baby
We can work it out
'Cause we still have time

I'm glad to see it means as much to you
As it does to me
Maybe we can celebrate our victory
Over our past
We'll work it out, baby, yes, we can
I didn't even notice
That you were suffering from neglect
While I was out there playing the games of life
I was losing all your respect, whoa...

Better late than never
(Better late, better late)
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
We're gonna work things out right now, hey, baby
Better late than never, yeah
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
Ooh, it's too late for love's never too late, yeah

Better late than never
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
It's not too late, we can make it great
Oh, babe, oh, babe, oh, babe, whoo!
Better late than never
(Never too late)
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
And I mean what I'm saying
From the bottom of heart and my soul
Trust me, baby, trust me, my love

(Better late, better late than)
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm...
(Better late, better late than never)
I've got so much to give ya
Please, baby, come on
(Better late, better late than)
Come on, come on, come on, oh-oh-oh...
(Better late, better late than never)
It's not too late for love, oh, baby
Better late than never, never
Never too late, yeah

// My Search Is Over //

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Now we find each other
In a search that never ends
All I wanted was a lover
But in you I find a friend
How'd we find that someone
In a world that's so untrue
I'm so glad my search is over
For I found true love in you
Oh, yes, I have

You had given up on
All the finding other men
One that wasn't playing games with love
And one who could understand
The mysteries of a woman
And the things you all go through
But my search is finally over
For I found true love in you

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
You're the one I've waited on
And when I hold half the peace inside
My heart makes me know that, ooh...
I found true love in you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

Think of all the changes
That our search for love can take us through
Whoa, I know lately I traveled
Down the road that led me to you, yeah
Now my search is over
And I know just what to do
I'm gonna hold you tight
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with you
With you, you, you, you, you

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
Let us stay together from now on

My search is over
For I finally found true love
My search is over
You're the one I've waited on
And when I hold half the peace inside
My heart makes me know that, ooh...
I found true love in you
Found true love in you

I don't want nobody else
To satisfy myself I found in you
Oh, I found true love in you

// WKOOL //

It's gonna be a scorcher out there today
It's goin' up to about 100 degrees
About 98% humidity
But you're tuned in to WKOOL
And we be coolin' all the time

// Summer //

Takin' a walk, summer nights
In the park
Old friends, checker games
Down the street, stickball playin'
Chill, to the beach
I can't beat the heat
So I hit the streets

Ooh, summer
Ooh, summer

Ooh, summer
Ooh, summer

Ooh, summer
Ooh, summer

Ooh, summer
Ooh, summer
Ooh, summer

// Give Right Now To You //

I don't know for certain
How long our love can last
All I know is how I feel
And time will surely pass
So for now I'll hold you in my arms
And give right now to you

Mine is not to promise you
Tomorrow's goings-on
For time reveals our destinies
In life before too long
Let me give you
What is truly mine to give
Let me give right now to you

I don't know where we'll go
Or if the sun will even shine
Again before my very eye
I know that I'm in love with you now
If we could see tomorrow somehow
We will awake to another day
And I will walk you by my side

Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you

Now you're down, you're sorrowful
Because I feel this way
But I can only offer you
The promise of today
Let me give you
What is truly mine to give
Let me give right now to you

I don't know where we'll go
Or if the sun will even shine
Again before my very eye
All I know is I'm in love with you now
If we could see tomorrow somehow
We will awake to another day
And I will walk you by my side

Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
(Hey, yeah)
Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, mm-mmm-mmm...
Let me give right now to you

// State Of The Earth Address //

People!
The world today is in a very difficult situation
And we all know it
We must heal all the wounds of war
Inhumanity and pollution
Because we are responsible
For the care of this Earth and all its children
We must learn to live together
And to love each other
I believe that one day
Our Creator will let us know
Who's gonna take the weight!

// It's Not Too Late //

It's not too late to make a stand
Open your heart and love your brother man
It's not too late to make a stand
Open your heart and love your brother man
It's not too late to make a stand
Open your heart and love your brother man
It's not too late, it's not too late...

// Show Us The Way To Love //

Sunset has come to the city by the ocean
He finds his shelter for the night
Soup boils over at some welfare hotel
While she prays to feed her children well

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost
So we live a life of tunnel vision
Forgetting to see what we want

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Morning has come to a city on the river
People dressed in black, cars in a row
Another live taken by some scourge of mankind
There'll be details on news at nine

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Mmm-mm-mm-mm...

Twilight has come to a town on the mountains
Family is shunned for the skin they live in
One more role model falls by the wayside
People, who do we look up to now, whoa...

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Show us the way

For you are the flame
The sparkling is inside of you
And we must reclaim
What we were from the start
It's a matter of heart, yeah

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Show us the road to love

Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Which way the road to love
Show me the way to love
Show us to love
Show me the way to love

Teach me to love, to love
Show us to love, to love
Show us the way to love
Teach us to love
The way to love

// Now Is The Time //

I'll make sure that everything I feel
Is the truth, the gospel truth
And once I know it's the truth
I'm gonna build it if it costs me my life

Now is the time!
Now is the time!
Now is the time!
Now is the time!

// Unite //

In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite
In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite

Years ago, our doors were locked
A nation undivided and people traveled free
Farmers and fishermen, we all live as one
Had one destiny and everybody knew we lived in peace

Come together, all nations, with no boundaries
Let's make our two as whole
And let's not forget the sound of gunfire
Our time has come, a new day has begun
Before our work is done, we all must become one
Yeah, yeah

In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite
We all must unite, yeah, yeah
In order to win the fight
We all must unite

We are family
Let's not be divided by the countries we live in
This, our country
Let's do it for our children and our nations, yeah

Out in this great big sun there's only one type of people
South, north, east, west, we're all created equal
Let's drop our differences, war, let's end it
By living in peace and harmony like God intended
What's more for, somebody needs to ask it
To see that the only cure is in a pine box casket
If that's the case, then we can kiss goodbye the human race
What's it gonna be like when our babies are growin' up
Chaos, mayhem, the little world blowin' up
We oughta make that change
Before the world's rearranged with war and bloodstains
Embrace me, brother, with all your might
Come together as one, we must unite, Kool and the Gang
We gotta get together if we wanna win the fight

Come together, all nations, with no boundaries
Let's make our two as whole
And let's not forget the sound of gunfire
Our time has come, a new day has begun
Before our work is done, we all must become one

We are family
Let's not be divided by the countries we live in
This, our country
Let's do it for our children and our nations

Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh...
Oh, yeah
We are one nation under the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We all are one people
One people under the sun
We all are one nation
One nation under the sun

Yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta be together, everybody
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
We are one nation under the sun, yeah

We all are one people
(Tell me what it is, what it is)
(What it is, yeah)
One people under the sun
(We all must unite, yeah)
We all are one nation
(Oh, yeah)
One nation under the sun
(One people, one nation)
(One people, one nation)

We all are one people
(Oh, everybody, yeah)
One people under the sun
(We must unite, oh, we must unite)
(Yeah, yeah)
We all are one nation
(We've got to live as one)
One nation under the sun
(Nations undivided, people all are free, yeah...)

// God Will Find You //

Last night, I overheard you talk
To Jesus in your yard
Looked at the sky with tears in your eyes
Never heard you pray so hard
Tonight is a different night
You can't take it anymore
Packed up your bags and took what you need
Left a note by the door

And, oh, you just keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean
God will find you
And, oh, you just keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean
God will find you
God will find you out, find you out

Today, I saw a man
Just wandering in the street
His clothes were old, his face was weary
No shoes on his feet
I thought about how you were
And wondered where you'd be
I only hope and pray to God
You were better off than he

You can't keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean, yeah
God will find you
Oh, you just keep running and running
God will find you
God will find you out
God will find you out
He will find you out

Mmm, yeah

Someday, you are gonna feel
A change in your heart
'Cause you were living the kind of life
That is bound to fall apart
And while you were tumbling down
God will recall your prayers
'Cause you will find out that in this life
He's the only One who cares

You can't keep running, baby
God will find you
Over the mountains and over the ocean, yeah
God will find you
Ooh, no, it doesn't matter where you try to hide
God will find you
And it doesn't matter what you feel inside
God will find you

He will find you out, whoo!
God will find you
La-da-da-da-da...
God will find you
He will find you out
God will find you
Oh, there ain't no mountain He can't climb
God will find you
And we're running, running
Running, running out of time
God will find you
He will find you out
God will find you
God will find you out
God will find you...

// Spatial Relationships //

God, Allah, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, our Father, Allah, Yahweh, Jesus, Buddha...

Our Father in Heaven
Thou is the greatest
Our Father in heaven
Thee is Thy will
Our Father in heaven
All will be done
God is within every man
Not every man is with God
But God will find them
God will find you
