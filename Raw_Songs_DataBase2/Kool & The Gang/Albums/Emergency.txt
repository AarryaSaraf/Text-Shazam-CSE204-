Album: Emergency

// Emergency //

I need a taxi, she's so hot fresh
In the serious love reaction
Give it to me 'cause I need your love
Woman heal me, feel my heart beat

Keep this body from a dangerous over heat
Give it to me 'cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
I need love, I need you, I need a cure, what should I do?
Give it to me, urgent, your love, emergency

Sunday, I'm growing so strong
With every touch, baby
Of your electric body
You rescued me from the fire of heart-break

And you knew just what I should take
Thank you girl for my survival
And a love so strong, you feel so good
It's so much more than physical

Everything is, oh, so beautiful
Girl, I need deep in my system

Love your cool and so a dripping
Give it to me, urgent
'Cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
Sweet sensations dancing through us
As we're making love

Give it to me, urgent, I need your love, baby
Emergency, emergency
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection, give satisfaction
Give it to me, emergency, emergency

Sunday, I'm growing so strong
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection give satisfaction
Give it to me, urgent, I need your love, baby
Emergency, emergency

Emergency, urgent
Emergency, as we're making love
Give it to me, urgent 'cause I need your love
Emergency, emergency
You energize me, standing beside me

Love and affection give satisfaction

// Fresh //

Conversation is going 'round
People talking 'bout the girl who's come to town
Lovely lady, pretty as can be
No one knows her name she's just a mystery

I have seen her maybe once or twice
The one thing I can say is, she's very nice
She's a lady, one I really want to know
Somehow I've got to let my feeling show

She's fresh, exciting
She's so exciting to me
She's fresh, exciting
She's so inviting to me, yeah

I've been thinking about the way you walk
Baby, I like the way you talk
Tell you something I really can't hide
Heaven must have sent you to be by my side

Fresh and lovely like a dream come true
I'll give anything to spend the night with you
What a feeling and I can't stop it baby
Miss frisky lady take me away

She's fresh, exciting
She's so exciting to me, yeah
She's fresh, exciting
So inviting to me, yeah

Fresh as a summer breeze
She'll take you by surprise
She means so much to me
I'll do whatever to make her mine, baby
Oh yeah

She's fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's fresh, she's so fresh

Fresh as a summer breeze
She means so much to me, yeah
I want to take her by the hand
And pray she'll understand

'Cause I love the way she walks
And ooh baby, I love the way she talks
I've got something and I hope she'll understand
Miss frisky lady, ohh

Sheis so fresh and I love that lady,
Oh, how I love 'em so, yeah

She's fresh, she's so fresh
She's so fresh, she's so fresh
She's so fresh

// Misled //

Late at night, body's yearning
Restless night, want to be with you
Someone's playing in the garden
So enticing, he's sure to take a bite
I don't know what's come over me, yeah

She's as heavy as a Chevy
Pure excitement, misled
When she touches, can't resist her
I'm a puppet when she's playing me
She's outgoing but I love her so misled
So I'm saying now

Baby baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place, you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Be misled, be for real

Thought I knew her, this lady
Opportunist, misled
Always searching for adventure
Like Pandora's box, misled
And I don't know what I'm gonna do without her

Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place, you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price if I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Be misled or be for real

I've got this feeling and it's blocking my way
But I love her just the same, just the same
Oh yes I do

Misled, heard you call my name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?
Misled, took me by the head
Misled, said I would understand

Misled, with a bomb of broken Venus
Misled, not a word is said
Misled, baby, that's your name
Misled, what's your claim to fame?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Misled, won't you be for real?

Baby, baby, what's your claim to fame?
Got me out of bed, heard you call my name
What's this crazy place you want to take me to?
Tell me, what's the price If I go with you?

My heart, my soul, my love
Is that the goal?
It's a thrill then I will
Hey misled, won't you be for real?

Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, misled
Misled, ..
Misled, misled
Misled
I was misled by you
Misled
Misled

// Cherish //

Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
The time is passing by

I often pray before I lay down
By your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have, for as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down
By your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have, for as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love
Cherish the life

Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have, for as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have, for as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

// Bad Woman //

Bad woman, mad woman
Satisfy the man
Bad woman, mad woman

Every time that I see lovers
Look into each others eyes
I realize the best of my life was you
Now I left you with the blues
Or what we put each other through
Girl, we let good love blow away like sand

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Hurry, now your plane is leaving
I'm not a fool in believing
You won't be there
Waitin' on the other side

Girl, I've had love and laughter
It's your love that I'm after
Two wrongs never make it right

Love will heal us
Love will make it right

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Hurry, now your plane is leaving
I'm not a fool in believin'
That you won't be there
Waitin' on the other side

Girl, I've had love and laughter
It's your love that I'm after
Two wrongs never make it right

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I call your name
You're the only one
To ever satisfy the man

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless nights I'll see your face
Girl, I reach for you
But only time's been spent

Bad woman, mad woman
Sleepless night I'll call your name
'Cause you're the only one to satisfy the man
Bad woman, mad woman
You know it's not about you, you're not there
And I wonder where you are

Bad woman, mad woman, yeah
Each night I'll call your name
And I wonder where you are
Bad woman, mad woman, bad woman
I will wait for you every night

Shed a tear in the middle of the night
Feel around, look around but you're not there
You're not there, anywhere to be found
You bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad woman

Bad, bad, bad woman, bad woman
Satisfy the man
