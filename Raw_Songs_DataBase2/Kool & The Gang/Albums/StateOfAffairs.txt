// Salute To The Ladies //

You've come a long way, Baby,
To get where you belong
You've come a long way,
And still you've got it going on

We're sending out this message
We want the world to know
It's time to show the Ladies
Just how much we love them so

[Bridge]
Red, yellow, black or white
It doesn't matter what you are tonight
We're gonna celebrate - put your name in lights
Come to attention,
Everybody on the floor!

[Chorus]
Salute to the Ladies
"Give it up" for the Ladies
Salute to the Ladies
'Cause we love you

Salute to the Ladies
"Give it up" for the Ladies
Salute to the Ladies

You've come a long way, Baby,
To get where you belong
Just like Aretha,
You're the Queen on the throne

We're sending out this message
To every house and home
It's time to show the Girls
That we respect and love them so

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

// In The Hood //

Summer, mercury is high
Hangin' with my baby
Love is on my mind
Jeep style, music pumpin' high
Everybody's dancin', stars are in the sky

It's a beautiful night in the hood
I'm feelin' good
Coolin' with the ladies
The way that we should
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

People come out to play
Brothers and Sisters from around the way
Jeep style, music pumpin' strong
Everybody's chillin' all night long

It's a beautiful night in the hood
I'm feelin' good
Coolin' with the ladies
The way that we should
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

Hangin' out in the hood, feeling good
Hangin' out in the hood, feeling good

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

It's a beautiful night in the hood.
I'm feelin' good
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah

// Color Line //

Little girl in a big town born with a silver spoon
One parent black, one parent white
Made her way to a school
With the children of the rainbow
But inside her eyes she was color blind

But then she met a black child
Who the people call a victim of a messed up system
They both tried but they couldn't see eye to eye
He said, "Girl you gotta choose
Which side you wanna stand on
If you wanna stand with me
I wanna know, who do you think you really are?"
And she said

[Chorus]
"Tell me where do I stand
When I stand on the color line?
We're so quick to judge, nobody knows
Tell me what I should be
When I stand on the color line?
And I wonder who really knows"

Made her way into a college
When the girl turned seventeen
So beautiful, so very wise
She had a vision of a family,
Home, and her own career
She remained the apple of her parents eye

Then she met a white child
Who said that he loved her
Didn't care about culture
"You can be whatever you want today
But you know you gotta choose
Which side you wanna stand on
If you wanna stand with me
I wanna know, who do you think you really are?"
And she said,

[Chorus]

A grown woman in a bed
At a local sanitarium
The nurse feeds her food and then combs her hair
In a place where her mind used to be she remembers
How her life was good when she used to care

Then her mind flashed back
To the night when both men asked her to marry
But every offer comes along with a deal
They both said, "You gotta choose
Which side you wanna stand on
If you wanna stand with me
How do you know,
How do you know who you really are?"
And she said,

[Chorus]

// Second Thoughts //

You told me that you were over him
No longer lovers - not even friends
You gave me your guarantee
When you gave your heart to me - forever

Lately, Baby, you've been acting strange
It seems that your heart has been rearranged
When we make love you're not there
I catch you staring in the air
Just going through the motions -
That's why I question your devotion

[Chorus]
Are you having second thoughts?
Are you thinking about the one, girl
That you lost?
Are you having second thoughts?

I heard you calling out someone's name
While you were sleeping right next to me
You say it's only a dream
And you don't remember a thing -
But that's not the first time that it happened -
Girl, that sounds a bit suspicious to me

[Chorus 2]
Are you having second thoughts?
Are you thinking about the love, Girl,
That you lost?
Are you having second thoughts?
Are you wishing that you would've made
Another choice?

[repeat 3X]

[Bridge]
Than the one that you made -
Are you thinking that I'll use you
And then walk away?
Was it something I said
Or something I did?
Tell me baby -
Make me understand

[Chorus 2]

// Crabs In A Barrel //

My Father died when I was ten
But Mother never spent much time with him
'Cause Papa was a rollin' stone
He left eight girls and three boys
Mama said, "Just trust in the Lord
And follow His Golden Rule"

Now I'm a professional
The girls are all doing wonderful
We fought our way from poverty
Bought Mom a house on the hill
So she could have a better place to live
Pay back for the life she's given me

[Bridge]
Some people in the neighborhood
Say that we think we're too good
'Cause we found a better way
They say that we sold out
From the ghetto we got out
Why people - do you treat us this way?

[Chorus]
We're just like -
Crabs in a Barrel - we're the same
Try to get out - they pull you back again
Like crabs in a barrel - hear what I say
It's dog eat dog -
Gotta know how to play the game

There's a child prodigy, gifted from infancy
Greatness was his destiny
He studied hard, played no ball
At seven years played Carnegie Hall,
Broadway and over seas
He read about black history
Find out from which he came to be -
Not long ago his people were set free
Every night he would pray
Thank God for another day
And for bringing us out of misery

[Bridge]

[Chorus X3]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

// Woman, Lover, Friend //

Every man needs a woman who understands
When you need time to be alone
When you need a helping hand
A woman to love, and woman who'll love you back
One who's faithful, honest, loyal, and true
Baby, that someone is you

And I'm so glad I've got you in my life today
You're all these things rolled into one
And I'm so proud to say -

[Chorus]
That you are my woman
My lover, and you are my friend
And I'll do anything for you, Baby
You are my woman
My lover, and you are my friend

When I get home, you're waiting there for me
With open arms and a kiss "hello"
The moment that I hit the door -
Dinner is ready, I hear water running in the bath
And when you're dressed in your favorite lingerie
I know what you want, you don't have to say

Baby Girl, I'm happy, and I'll do anything for you
'Cause we've got something special
That I don't want to lose

[Chorus X2]

[Bridge]
My friend - Baby, Baby
You are my woman, you are my friend
My friend - Baby, Baby
My lover, my friend

[Bridge X2]

[Chorus X2]

You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You are my woman, my lover, my friend
I'm gonna love you straight 'til the end
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

[Chorus X2]

// Game Of Love //

[Chorus]
If you've never been hurt
Then you've never been in love before
If you've never felt pain
Then you've never played the game
The game of love

Two people in two places
Their hearts are being wasted
'Cause each is afraid to try

Now it's time to take some chances
To find out what romance is
All you have to do
Is tell the one you need
How much "I really love you"

[Chorus]

But you keep hesitating
Afraid hearts will start breaking
And you'll be left alone

You will never find out
Why your mind has its doubts
The world of love calls you
To fall into the arms of someone who really loves you

[Chorus]

// 90's News //

So sad, so bad
State of affairs
So sad, so bad
State of affairs

// Life In The '90s //

[Chorus]
Life in the 90's
So good, so bad.
State of affairs

Life in the 90's
So good, so bad.
State of affairs

I remember when 1990 came in
We celebrated all night long
1991, South Africa's under the gun
They had to let Mandela go

[Chorus]

Brand new President
An historical event, back in 1992
Billboard Magazine says black music is the king
Teddy gave us New Jack Swing

[Chorus]

Sex is not the same
AIDS made us change the game
Back in 1994
In 1995 people almost lost their mind
Getting high on this thing crack

[Chorus]

1996, Olympic games are in the mix
Atlanta, Georgia put on the show
1997, Heaven only knows
Where this thing is gonna go

[Chorus]

1999 it's the sign of the times
And Revelation's told us so

[Chorus]

// Friends //

It's been a long time since I held you tight
It's been a long time since I kissed you good night
What's a man supposed to do
When he's still in love with you, girl

It's been a long time since we made love
It's been a long time since I told you that I care
What's a girl supposed to do
Now that it's over
Between me and you

[Chorus]
If we can't be lovers
Maybe we can be friends
If our love has lost the magic
Let's be friends 'til the very end
If we can't be lovers
Maybe we can be friends
Since our love has lost the magic
Let's be friends

It's been a long time since we said I do
It's been a long time since we made plans for two
What are we supposed to do
Now that it's over
Between me and you

[Chorus]

Life is much too short
And we don't know when it will end
A sunny day or rainy night
There's no way of tellin'

We can't throw away all those years
Filled with happiness
We've got one good reason
To give it our best

Inside you lives a part of me
And He's gonna need the two of us
To help fulfill his dreams

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

// My Body //

When the sky turns to black
All of a sudden I get that love attack
Without warning it says "Hello"
It tells me that my sea is stormin'

I rub my hands up and down your spine
Gotta let you know what's on my mind
Lady, turn yourself around
And give your love to me

[Chorus]
My Body, Body, Body, Body
Wants your Body
My Body, Body, Body
Needs you
My Body, Body, Body, Body
Got to have your Body
My Body, Body, Body
Is Taylor made for you

On the beach - hangin' out
Even at a party - Girl you turn me out
It doesn't matter where we go
When I get the feelin'
I've gotta let it show

I rub my hands up and down your spine
Gotta let you know what's on my mind
Lady, turn yourself around
And give your love to me

[Chorus X2]

Girl, let's take this ride
Into the sunset, gonna make you sweat
Lady, hold on tight - Get into the motion
The motion baby

[Chorus]

// Reunited //

[Chorus]
Reunited 'cause love lifts us higher on wings of our love, we've gone through the fire
Reunited 'cause love lifts us higher on wings of our love, we've gone through the fire

All the loves that life takes us through I find my heart coming back to you.
Girl for so long I played the fool.
I see clearly now, your love is true

[Chorus]

You by my side, I feel so strong.
Girl you and I stayed apart so long.
Your loving heart knows that I'm true.
My love is real, I'm right for you.

[Chorus]

Take my hand, girl we're blessed
In this life that we live.
Everyday I thank God for the love that you give.

[Chorus]
