// A Place In Space //

Come on, let's get down, get right on down
Come on, let's get down, get right on down

Let's dance, let's shout
Let's get on down to the funky sounds
Let's dance, let's shout, come on!

Everybody get down to the funky sounds
In a funky time and a funky place in space

We are all your shining stars
In a universe of peace and harmony
Let your spirits be free
There's no place in space for you and me
Hit me!

Get down on Mars and other stars
(Whoop, whoop-whoop)
So come on, let's get down on this planet of ours
Groove to the music, ride with the times
Dance to the music, now's the time

Everybody rejoice and sing a song
We've come so far on this old star today
Come on, let's get high on peace and love
Sharin', sharin' like that is the way
I like it

Get down on Mars and other stars
(Whoop, whoop-whoop)
So come on, let's get down on this planet of ours
Groove to the music, ride with the times
Dance to the music, now's the time

Come on, let's get down to the funky sounds
In a funky time and a funky place in space
Everybody get up, and get away
There's no place in space today, come on!

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now, so then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Let's dance, let's shout
Let's get on down to the funky sounds
Let's dance, let's shout, come on!

Come on, y'all, get down, get right on down
Come on, let's get down, get right on down

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you

Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you
Crank it up now and then it'll come to you...

Keep your sense of pride

// The Force //

Ow!

A long time ago
In a place not far away (well)
Everybody partied
Very hearty everyday (uh-huh)
They all danced real funky
And they got down all the time (yeah)
Singin' songs of glory
Telling stories with a rhyme

There's somebody dancin'
Now the power got a source
They told us it was funk
And they got it from the force
You could feel it in the air
You could feel it everywhere (uh-huh)
And they danced all night
Till the early morning light

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Can you, yow!

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Can you, let's get on down

Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow
Just hit me with the funk
Do-da-de-do, do-da-de-do-do-dow

Don't force the funk
Just let it flow
But feel the force
Then you'll all know
You can't force the funk
You got to let it flow
Well, then get on down and let go

Feel the force
Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Yow!
Just get on down

Can you feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Yow!
Let's get on down

Feel it!
Feel the force

Feel it!
Feel the force...

// Mighty Mighty High //

Don't give in to lower vibes
It will get you every time

Time is now and now is time
Time to rise to higher vibes

Everyone around the world
The time has finally come
The people of the planet Earth
We all must live as one
All for one and one for all
In peace and harmony
Come together, one another
For eternity, think about it

Well
Oh-oh-oh-whoa...
Well

It's time for us to understand
Just what's in the master plan
We was placed on Earth to be
Masters of creation, see
Life began for us to grow
Peace and love we all must show
The question's asked to make it clear
Where do we all go from here?

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, whoa-oh-oh-oh...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, whoa...

Everybody, sing together

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow

Be true to yourself and self will be
True to you and we will see
Self is what we ought to be
Be yourself and you will see
Open up your ears, you'll hear
Knowledge of this atmosphere
Universal consciousness
Is the word that is the best

Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow
Mighty, mighty high
Mighty, mighty low
Tell me which way does your mind grow...

// Oasis //

Hey, wait a minute
I think I see somethin'
Hey, is that you?
Hey, it's, uh, it's...
I found you
Water!

I searched the world thinking I'd never find you
All of my chances were a million to one
It seems that life would end before I found you
But now my journey's finally ended, yeah

I found my oasis
Yes, I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey, baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

I see that now I should have never doubted
For now my time has finally come, ooh, yeah
It's been so long since I have waited for you
Baby, I know you're the one for me

I found my oasis
I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey, baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

I found my oasis
Yes, I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey-hey, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Baby, yeah

I found you finally!

I searched the world never thinking I'd find you
And now I have my oasis of love

I found my oasis
I found my oasis
When I found you

// Life's A Song //

Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo)
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
(Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, oh, yo, yo)
Life with music in your soul

Your heart's the fire
Burning with desire
Your passion's burning
Like a burning flame
Wisdom light shines on a few
Well, you're a child
Who really wants a view
You possess the greatest seed
Love is all you really, really
Really, really need

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Deep down in your soul)
Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, in your heart)
Life with music in your soul

Let your heart just be your guide
Take your mind and search inside
What you cannot see with eyes
Let you know you can't deny, life

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Just like a song, we sing)
Life's a song in your heart
(Y'all sing)
Life with music in your soul
(Can you feel it)

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
(You possess the greatest seed)
Life with music in your soul
(Love is all you really, really)
(Really, really need)

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Deep down in your soul)
Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, in your heart)
Life with music in your soul

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul...
