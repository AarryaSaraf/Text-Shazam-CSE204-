No, no, no

Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feeling sentimental
Going in our separate ways
But wind up back here in the middle
Losing you I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waiting for you just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, na, na, na

Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again

So fuck this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave then go
If you need me let me know
Love me or just let me go, but no

Na, na, na
Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again

(Fuck) this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose, no
There I go and fall again

(Fuck) this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again and again

Oh, again
Oh, no
Here I go again
