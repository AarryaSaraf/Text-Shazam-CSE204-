Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
Ay, hear ye
I'm the new town crier, yeah, I took over for Barry
I know you'll miss him, but he died of dysentery
So now I'm here with the announcements of the day
Got my band beside me, I know you like the way they play
Today we got news for you ladies and gents
A changin' of the guard is soon to commence
But this one is special, better than the shire fair
Because this time, the whole royal family will be there (Oh yeah)
King Rowan, of course, and our Queen Beatrice
And their fancy royal robes, you don't want to miss
Prince Robert with the hair, Princess Gwen no doubt
See the new guards come in and old roll out
Yeah
