I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Won't say I'm yours, won't say I'm not
I'm somewhere between, while you're at the bar downtown
It's been a month and we're getting close
But not close enough, to love you or hate you now
In the morning, you look like an angel
But the devil's buying you a table
Serving a drink, you're making your rounds
Picture it all, I'm out of my mind right now

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you had, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, but I
I had to see it with my own eyes

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't (I know that you think I don't)
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Ahh
