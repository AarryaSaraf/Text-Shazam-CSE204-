He's a bad dancer
He's a right answer
He's a shy singer
Most of the time
Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker
He's a slow kisser
A confessed sinner
All of the time
When it's him and I

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I was not living
I was just writing about it
With my head spinning
Days passing by most of the time, yeah

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I dream of you, I dream of you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, oh

Please say you dream of me too
Can you please say you dream of me too

Oh woah woah

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I dream of you, I dream of you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
