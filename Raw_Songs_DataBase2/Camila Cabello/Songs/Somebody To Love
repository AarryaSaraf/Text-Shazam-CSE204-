Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard
(He works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end of the day
I'm all on my own
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard
(He works hard)
Everyday of my life (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
