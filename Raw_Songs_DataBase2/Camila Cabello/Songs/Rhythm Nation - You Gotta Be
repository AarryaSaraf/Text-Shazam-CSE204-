People of the world today are looking for a better way of life
We are a part of the rhythm nation
We are a part of the rhythm nation

Looking for a better way of life

Listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Others, they may cause you tears, go ahead release your fears
Stand up and be counted, 'cause you wanna let you try

You gotta be, you gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know love will save the day
All I know, all I know love will save the day

We are a part of the rhythm nation

Time asks no questions, it goes on without you (Without you)
Leaving you behind, if you can't stand the pace (Can't stand the pace)
The world keeps on spinning, can't stop it if you try to
The best part is dangerous, staring you in the face

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know love will save the day

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta, gotta, gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta, gotta, gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know, all I know
You gotta be cool, and calm, so strong

'Cause we are a part of the rhythm nation
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of the better way, a better way of life, of life
(We are a part of the rhythm nation)
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is love will save the day
