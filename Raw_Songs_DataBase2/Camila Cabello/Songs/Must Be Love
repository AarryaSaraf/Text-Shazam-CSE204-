Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I took your hand and I jumped right in
I guess everything has a consequence, oh I, I
I can hide, and put on a show
'Cause the highs are highs
But the lows are lows
You control me more than you've ever known
But I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, oh

I fall hard, that's just how I am
And I bend and break like a rubber band
Everything gets real after two AM
So don't, don't, don't look at me like that
When you're the one that implied that
'Cause I'm gonna look at you right back
I promise you ain't gonna like that, yeah
We fuss and we fight, forget that night
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh

(Love, love, love...)
And I could just give you up

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much (so much)
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up

Must be love
Yeah...
Must be love...
