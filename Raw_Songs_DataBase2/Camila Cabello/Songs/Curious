I lose myself when you start talkin'
There's something riveting about you, it's got me confused
If we went back to your apartment
Would you be a gentleman and a bad boy too?

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been?
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you

I'm just cu-, I'm just curious
What you do, just got the two of us
Hit me down, take me up
Can you teach me how to love?
I'm just curious

Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling

I'm kinda nervous but I like it (Yeah)
Will you live up to the image that I got of you?
You're not usually my type, yeah
I think that that might be the reason that I'm here with you (Oh, oh)

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been? (No, no)
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you (Yeah, ayy-ayy)

I'm just cu-, I'm just curious
What you do, just got the two of us
Hit me down, take me up
Can you teach me how to love? (How to love? Yeah)
I'm just curious

Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum
Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been? (No, no)
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you (Yeah, ayy-ayy)

I'm just cu-, I'm just curious
What you do, just got the two of us
Hit me down, take me up
Can you teach me how to love? (How to love? Yeah)
I'm just curious

Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum
Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum
