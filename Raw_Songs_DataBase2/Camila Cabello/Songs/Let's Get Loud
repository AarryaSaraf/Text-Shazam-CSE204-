Let's get loud...

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
Come on people, let's get loud
Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud

Ain't nobody gotta tell ya what you gotta do
If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way, and don't you waste it (Don't you waste it no)
Every feeling, every beat
Can be so very sweet, you gotta taste it (You gotta taste it)

(You gotta do it) You gotta do it, do it your way
(You gotta prove it) Don't you let nobody lead you astray
(You gotta prove it) You gotta prove it, gotta mean what you say
Like dah da dah da da dah dah

Life's a party, make it hot
Dance, don't ever stop, whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
They ain't here to stay, you gotta live them (Yeah)

(You gotta do it) You gotta do it (You gotta be bold, you gotta be wise)
You've got to prove it (You gotta be tough, you gotta be strong)
You gotta mean it
Let's get loud

(Let's get loud) no no no
(Let's get loud) ooh
(Let's get loud) yeah
(Like dah da dah da da dah)

Life is meant to be fun
You're not hurting anyone
Nobody looses
Let the music make you free
Be what you wanna be
Make no excuses

Oh, you gotta do it (Gotta do it, gotta do it your way)
You've gotta mean it (Gotta mean it, gotta mean what you say)
And don't you let nobody lead you astray
(And don't you let nobody lead you astray)
I know I want (I know you want)
Noo (Noo)
So (So)

Let's get loud
Let's get get loud loud loud loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell ya what you gotta do (Like dah da dah dah da)
Let's get loud (Let's get loud)
Let's get loud
All I know, all I know love will save, love will save the day
(Let's get loud, let's get loud, let's get loud)
