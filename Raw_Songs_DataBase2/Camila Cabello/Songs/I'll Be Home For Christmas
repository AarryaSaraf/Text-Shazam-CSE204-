I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas (I'll be home for Christmas)
You can count on me (You can count on me)
Please have snow (Have snow) and mistletoe (Yeah, yeah)
And presents under the tree (Under the tree)

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

In my dreams, my dreams
My dreams
