So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it

Show up at my door but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me your songs but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused (Ah)
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it

Isn't it somethin' that I get more when I'm givin' you nothin' (Huh)
Isn't it magic, that when you stop lookin' for it, it happens (Oh)
Baby, he fell from grace, landed right in your place
Kissed me so many times, that I forgot your taste

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now, now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it
You should've said it, love
Should've said it
Should've said it, love

I wish that you could turn back the time
You'd hold me closer instead of your pride (Oh, oh)
I knew it was you from the very first night
And it took you two years to make up your mind

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (Ayy)
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it
You should've said it, love
Should've said it
You should've said it, love

So you want me now, now baby
So you want me now, now baby
So you want me now, no
You should've said it, should've said it, love
