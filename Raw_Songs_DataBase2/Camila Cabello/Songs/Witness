This my show, hold it down
Front and center on me right now
Spotlight high, you're my muse
You inspire all my latest moves

You're an audience member, if you want more, say, "Encore"
Got you buying tickets for the whole tour now, right now

'Cause you'll never forget
What you're about to witness
I can already tell
How much you're gonna miss this, boy
So, hold the applause, watch me do what I do
Do you like it? 'Cause, baby, you're my witness

Standing oh, watch me go
No photos, this is a private show
Got you out of your seat, you like me so much
Now it's your turn, give me all your love, oh

You're an audience member, if you want more, say, "Encore"

Standing, oh you can clap now
