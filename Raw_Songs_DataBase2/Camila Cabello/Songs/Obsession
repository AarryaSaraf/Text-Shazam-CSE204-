How'd you get so high from just one kiss? (Hm ya)
You took the words straight from my lips (Hm ya)

I've been watching you, you study how I move
Let's spice it up 'cause I've been studying you too
You want to dance beneath the moon?
Then that's exactly what we're gonna do

I am the one who's gonna keep you guessing
You know I'll raise the tension baby yeah
I am the one who's getting your attention
I know I'm your obsession baby yeah

How'd it get so hot in the middle of December? (Hm, ya)
I guess our love is strong enough to change the weather (Hm, ya)

And I've been watching you, you study how I move
Let's spice it up 'cause I've been studying you too
You want to dance beneath the moon?
Then that's exactly what we're gonna do

I am the one who's gonna keep you guessing
You know I'll raise the tension baby yeah
I am the one who's getting your attention
I know I'm your obsession baby yeah

I like it better when, I got you in my hands
You're wrapped around my finger, you follow my commands
You're in the center and, you got no room to let go
You know I'm taking full control

I am the one who's gonna keep you guessing
You know I'll raise the tension baby yeah
I am the one who's getting your attention
I know I'm your obsession baby yeah
