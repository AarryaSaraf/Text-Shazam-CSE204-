Hey
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
You need to hear this
Yeah

Gather round, heed my call
In two weeks there'll be a ball
And not just any ball, it's like a change of life
It's time the prince finally find his wife
That's right, single ladies you should be getting excited
Because every single one to the ball is invited
So tip off, do your hair, buy a fancy new dress
Paint your nails, you got a prince to impress
Yes, it's gonna be magic, yo, uh
So don't be tragic, yo, uh
Don't be a sad chick, yo, uh
Call yourself under-qualified, nah
Throw on a gown, y'all, uh
For a shot at the crown, y'all, uh
And prepare to get down, y'all, uh
As Prince Robert chooses his bride
