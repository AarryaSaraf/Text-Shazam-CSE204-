Accidentally made a joke that killed your boner
And I woke up so hungover
And I didn't even drink so much last night
And I hurt your feelings on the phone 'cause I'm pmsing
And you sent the sweetest message
I forgot to reply and I couldn't even tell you why

Most days I'm hilarious, confident, and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

Accidentally I sneezed and peed little
Looked in the mirror and my eyes jiggled
And it helps when you tell me I'm perfect but not this time

Most days I'm hilarious, confident, and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today
