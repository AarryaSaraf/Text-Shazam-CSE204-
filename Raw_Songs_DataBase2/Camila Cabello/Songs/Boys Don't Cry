I know thoughts you don't want in your head
Are spinnin' 'round-'round-'round
I know you got demons from the past
Slowin' you down-down-down
But you don't answer your FaceTime
You never had much of a poker face
It doesn't make you less of a man
You're just human right now

When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse
I just want to be close, my baby

Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?

Hate it when you shut me out
Acting like it's your shit to figure out
Don't want to be touched
Don't want to discuss
I get it, I just (Uh)
Now I'm in my head
About what's in your head
Come back to bed
Can we talk about it?
It's not stupid, it's not drama
It's just trauma turned to armor
Keeping you from me, no performing
If you love me, come and touch me (Yah)

When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse
I just want to be close, my baby
Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?

Yeah-yeah, yuh yeah
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry
Yeah-yeah, yuh yeah
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry

Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
(You know I gotcha)
Come my baby, lay your head on me
(You know I'd do anything for ya)
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me

Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?
Ooh-oh
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry
