Yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh, uh
Hey, alright

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Like I'm in a minuet
And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Leave it alone"

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you

La la la la la la la
(Whatta man whatta man, whatta mighty good man)
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta mighty good man whatta man, whatta mighty good man)

And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man)
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty mighty mighty mighty mighty good man
Whatta man whatta man whatta man whatta man)

Whatta man!
