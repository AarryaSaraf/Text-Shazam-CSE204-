I might say sorry way too much
Unnecessarily nervous
I feel every damn thing again
The sound of your name like a cut

I tried to hold the pieces inside
Tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Secretly dangerous
The hurt that you're capable of
I couldn't see you coming if I tried
You pulled the trigger and hide

I tried to hold the pieces inside
Tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Dealing with the scar tissue

Oh, I'm not okay
But I'm getting closer to it everyday
Closer and closer 'til you fade away
All I'm left with is the scar tissue

Yeah, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

(All the scars, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I'm going home, I'm trying)
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

I'm going home, I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm going home, I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying
