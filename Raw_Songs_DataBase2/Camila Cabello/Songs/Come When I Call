Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


I hit you up at half past three
Same old me
In my head and defeat
Mmm, ah
Find us underwater, water
Mmm, ah
Find us underwater, water
You're vicious like it's on repeat, I get weak
I hear my brain tell me
Mmm, ah
Find us underwater, water
Mmm, ah


So come when I call, come when I call
I might get wiser and question it all, I call
So come when I call
Come when I call


I see you in the moonlight
I fall in love when the moods right
And now I see you in a new light
I don't believe you, baby, baby, stay?
See you in the moonlight
When I'm at it, I turn it all
I fall in love when the moods right
Every time I turn around
I see you in the moonlight
Sing it again, babe
I don't believe you, baby, baby, stay?
I see you in the moonlight
When I'm at it, I turn it all
I fall in love when the moods right
Every time I turn around
And now I see you in a new light
Sing it again, babe
I don't believe you, baby, baby, stay?
Stay
Ooh, ooh, stay
Stay


Give it up, you come to me
I like 'em old, man, give it to me
Give it up, you come to me
I like 'em old, man, give it to me
Ooh, give it up, you come to me
I like 'em old, man, give it to me
Ooh, give it up, you come to me
I like 'em old, man, give it to me, mmm, mmm
Fall in love, la, la, la
Mmm, ah, mmm, ah
Fall in love, la, la, la


When I'm at it, I turn it all
Every time I turn around
Sing it again, baby
Yeah
When I'm at it, I turn it all
Every time I turn around
Sing it again, baby
Yeah
When I'm at it, I turn it all
Every time I turn around
Sing it again, baby
Yeah
