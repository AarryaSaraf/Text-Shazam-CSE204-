Come here and sit next to me
Don't look at me while I'm breaking
After what I'm gonna say
I understand if you hate me

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

I know I said we were friends
And when I said that, I meant it (Swear I meant it)
Somewhere between now and then
It became more than just a friendship

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

Come here and sit next to me
You tell me baby, just say it (Say it, say it)
Warning me, it's a mistake
I just know I gotta make it

And I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
There's somebody stuck in my head and I, and I
