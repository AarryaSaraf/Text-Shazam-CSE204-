Am I wrong for thinkin' out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for sayin' that I choose another way?
I ain't tryin' to do what everybody else doin'
Just 'cause everybody doin' what they all do
If one thing I know, how far would I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

So, am I wrong?
For thinkin' that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, it's wrong)
Now, am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see? (Ooh)
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Am I trippin', am I, for having a vision?
My prediction, I'ma be on top of the world
Hope you, hope you don't look back
Always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life
That's just how I feel, ooh
Fight for yours and don't let go
Don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone
That's just how I feel (That's just how I feel)
That's just how I feel

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right (I don't wanna be right)
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong (If you tell me I'm wrong)
I don't wanna be right, right (I don't wanna be right)
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong (If you tell me I'm wrong)
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong? (Am I wrong, am I wrong?)
For thinkin' that we could be something for real? (For real, for real)
Now am I wrong? (Am I wrong, am I wrong?)
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Tryin' to reach the things that I can't see

Am I wrong?
For thinkin' that we could be something for real? Oh...
Now am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?
