In a New York taxi cab
With an English man
I have never been kissed like that
So come on, kiss me again
And I felt your heartbreak
Drivin' down Charlotte Street for the first time
Now we are slow dancin' in your kitchen
How time's passed by

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doing for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darlin', I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we are old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Now we are walkin' hand-in-hand
In an English town
Gonna meet your momma and dad
And I am nervous now
Now I am in your home
Eating Sunday roast
And I say the wrong thin'
Then you catch my eye, give me a smile
Say you fit right in

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doing for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darlin', I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told...

Funny how no one knows all of our inside jokes
You know my demons by name, I know your beautiful soul
All of the secret we keep, you know that I will never leave...

So just keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been told
Never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told...

And yet, there's still so much left to unfold
The greatest love story that's never been told...
