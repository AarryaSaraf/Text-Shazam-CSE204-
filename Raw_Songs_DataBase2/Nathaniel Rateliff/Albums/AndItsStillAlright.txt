// What A Drag //

Ain't it a drag, babe
You feeling so safe
But you cannot hear or ignore

Here's where the crash lands
Not as graceful as one thinks
So brace for things you don't know

I left
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
But you can undo it, man

You seem surprised, babe
After years of the same thing
Well, I hope it's the half that you want

There's not a last dance
And no one really wins
So you cannot hold in your cries

Open your eyes
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
But you can undo it, man

// And It's Still Alright //

It ain't alright, the hardness of my head
Now, close your eyes and spin around
Say, hard times you could find, it
Ain't the way that you want
But it's still alright

Late at night, do you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far, but it
Ain't the way that you want
I'll be damned if this old man don't
Start to count on his losses
But it's still alright

They say you learn a lot out there
How to scorch and burn
Gonna have to bury your friends
Then you'll find it gets worse
Standing out on the ledge
With no way to get down
You start praying for wings to grow
Oh, baby, just let go

I ain't alright, you keep spinning out ahead
It was cold outside when I hit the ground
Said, I could sleep here, forget all the fear
It will take time to grow
Maybe I don't know

Hey, tonight if you think about it
Remembering all the times that you pointed out
Say, the glass is clear but all this fear
Starts a-leaving a mark
Your idle hands are all that stands
From your time in the dark
But it's still alright

// All Or Nothing //

I'll come back to you as a strong will tower to devour
Any sense you make but since you don't

You'll arrive and you
You think you're clever while it's severed
You just fill the air with words you know

I got all this and nothing too
I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You'd think I'd notice, but I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home

Too much time spent alone trying to pull yourself under
Is that thunder or the sense that someone calls your name

I want back from you all the hours that I cowered
While you corrected everything I'd say

You really found me out, so you used to think
Too much pain and doubt in one little space

I got all this and nothing too
I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You think I'd notice, but I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home

Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Don't say it's all or nothing, baby
Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Don't say it's all or nothing, baby

Don't come back and please don't lie to me
Please don't say it's all or nothing, baby

// Expecting To Lose //

What makes you sad, what makes you blue?
I'm all in rags with nothing to lose
We could traverse and find a way through
Land in the grass and start acting like fools

You're a prisoner by day
Is that what you choose?
Stand in the water, baby
It'll get you through tonight

Who did you razz, who starts the coup?
You went on a fast with no weight to lose
You said you were laying off of the booze
You came over drunk to lay on the truth

You're a prisoner by day
Expecting to lose
Stand in the water, baby
It'll get you through tonight

You came in the front to sneak back in the room
With all of your friends and all attitude
Went into a lunge while playing it cool
You said come here close and I'll lay on the truth
You're a prisoner by day
Expecting to lose
Stand in the water, baby
It will get you through tonight

You're a prisoner by day
Is that what you choose?
Stand in the water, baby
It will get you through tonight

// Tonight #2 //

Tonight
You are a one-armed man
Pinned to the ground in the coolest pose
The flash bulbs bursts, audience froze
Fixed their gaze on a hip seed dance

Tonight
Well, your eyes are crazy
Well, alright
I'm unarmed and just maybe we'll find a way
To let it all sink in

If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of the last morning

Tonight
We'll pretend we're friends
Except when we know the crowds too close
The book reading failed, but the curtain still closed
Fastest one wins, but who cares when you're going slow

Well, tonight
Lost an eye to being lazy
Well, alright
We could take time to learn language
Or not make a sound

If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of one last morning
If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of the last morning
If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of one last morning

// Mavis //

In other worlds
In other worlds I would be with you
And other nights
And other nights I think I've seen you
Caught on a way
Caught on a way I do not own you

And you relax
Knowing the way I do
I'd do for you

All that I've seen through
I do it for you
All again

In other times
You said your feet move so fast you couldn't see
Gone are the days
When you could start ahead and outrun me
And all the lights
And all the lights you say they're heavy now

I recall a time, you were mine
And all the time you bared your teeth
It was always just a smile for me

I recall a time, you were mine
And all the time you bared your teeth
It was always just a smile for me

// You Need Me //

It's like you're telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Or are you telling me now in the middle of the set it's through?
Or did I walk by and never saw it, maybe
Or I was reading my lines and I never heard my cue?

Running to the top of the hill, then the hill starts over
You can bury yourself in the ground that you dug up
Now I was just contemplating
When do the tears dry up?
Far too easy to bait me
At least we shared the cup

Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Or are you telling me now in the middle of the shit fuck you
I'm the only one left on the sinking boat not believing
And you were calling from the water and screaming back it's true

Start looking around and seeing it's far too easy
You could lose a limb in a snare you set for yourself
Now don't you try to fool me
When you're dumb, you don't fear as much
If it's gonna be that simple
I'd rather do it drunk

Stumbling 'round until you're queasy
You're losing your hair but you've got friends
And if it's gonna be that simple
I've got a long way to go to never again

Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?

// Time Stands //

For a moment I could wait to see it fall apart
Every empty bed in every city I've been
I sit and contemplate all the moments you said
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

What's that you used to say? Find a love that you can wait for
Or do you feast upon the weak and weary of heart?
I can take the pain but I can't take all the hatred
Laziness of mind and simplest of thoughts

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Now you're pouring out your hate at every difference you found
You won't even listen to reason at all
Not questioning your faith, far be it from me
But you would speak of love while tying ones hands

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Now lean and use your weight
That's what a shoulder's made for
Carry all the dead and children from here
Curses on the men and the greed that seems to plague them
I can't raise my hand so I'm raising my voice

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

// Kissing Our Friends //

Have you found your bed
Or somewhere you want to sleep?
As I rub my neck
Thought the stiffness would never leave

They say that wintertime is calming
But it sure hurts my hands
I ran the water for your bath
But you never came in

If you and I get too lonely
We start kissing all our friends
If you and I get too lonely
Remember we'll both still care

You and I get too lonely
Start kissing all our friends
If you and I get too lonely
Remember we'll both still care

// Rush On //

I hoped it would heal
Or you'd wake when it was over
Now counting the days
Since your breath had closed your eyes

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
And now you sleep forever
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

How easy you left
Remembering all your laughter
But deep in your chest
Was a moan that never ends

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
If I find you, I will wake you
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

I'd hoped like a prayer
That your brokenness would leave you
But months turned to years
And the emptiness prevailed

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on

All the love and cries could not shake you from your rest
Would've given up my sight to take the jaundice from your skin

Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
And now you sleep forever
Rush on, rush on
Rush on, rush on
