Wait.
We're going to win
It's about time we did
And I can't decide at all if we're good
And sure, I've been
You got a face that's hard to forget.

Aw,
I'm gonna get back to you
And oh, I know
It's hard to notice every small movement and slipping through the cracks.
And, well, it's what no one ever sees,
but it's got hard-working knees.
Well, calm me down.
I gets so rough.
I'm wallowing for months at a time.
I got no presence.
Here, I've got warm loneliness.
The heart just won't quit.
