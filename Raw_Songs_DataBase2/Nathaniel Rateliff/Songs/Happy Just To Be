I was ever lame and once was there, shallow diggin' deep
With hope and heart to heal
Fell into a hole we had dug, covered with some leaves
Covered you and me
Seems so complicated now we're down, and wanting to be free
I'm happy just to be

And when you feel the running, must have set its roots
All other heaviness will one day call a truce
I'm happy just to be

Felt it as it angled its way through, a sight I'd never seen
And saw it stickin' through
Pulled as much as I could force myself, and it would never do
No matter how I try
And now it comes to festering and swell, needle stitchin' threat
And close it once it's clean

And when you feel the running, must have set its roots
All other heaviness will one day call a truce
I'm happy just to be
