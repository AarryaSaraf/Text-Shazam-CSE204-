I need you baby, more than you'll ever, ever know
What keeps you waiting let's take our time just moving slow

I'm so lonely feeling heavy love
You're just so far from where I want you now
I need you

Come on now baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now baby, you think that I don't now
I need some honey
Come on now baby and

What if I told you, that there's a fight on every corner
They'll keep you wavering until you've reached some modern low
It's not just lazy, there's just some things you're never told

It can't always be this heavy love
We'll have to wear our fears so everyone
Can see it too

Come on now baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now baby, you think that I don't now
I need some honey
Come on now baby and
