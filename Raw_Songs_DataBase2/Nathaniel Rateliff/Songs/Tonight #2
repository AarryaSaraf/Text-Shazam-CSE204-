Tonight
You are a one-armed man
Pinned to the ground in the coolest pose
The flash bulbs bursts, audience froze
Fixed their gaze on a hip seed dance

Tonight
Well, your eyes are crazy
Well, alright
I'm unarmed and just maybe we'll find a way
To let it all sink in

If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of the last morning

Tonight
We'll pretend we're friends
Except when we know the crowds too close
The book reading failed, but the curtain still closed
Fastest one wins, but who cares when you're going slow

Well, tonight
Lost an eye to being lazy
Well, alright
We could take time to learn language
Or not make a sound

If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of one last morning
If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of the last morning
If the world goes strange, its dying flames
Would light the end of one last morning
