I was thinking about you
Out stuck along the way
Many people passing me by
Even when I show a little leg

If I could just thump on in
It never works that way
Tried to forget about it baby, and
Drown myself in a drink

But somebody knocked me off my chair and said

"You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
They said, "You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

So I picked myself up off the floor
Like one big bruise
I think a couple of broken ribs
Some mother stole my shoes
Now I'm gonna have to walk it off
Tear up my feet
It's just another reminder, baby, that
Nothing works for me

Then a cop stopped and picked me up

He said, "You got a friend you, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
He said, "You got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

Then the lump on my head
Stale bread, and old cold coffee
What's a fella got to do
To get a call and just talk to you
Get a call and just talk to you
Get a call and just talk to you

Then they said they'd loan me a dime

They said, "You got a fried, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you

They said, "If you've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
They said, "If you've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"

I mean, "You've got a friend, you better call them, unless somebody's comin' to get you"
