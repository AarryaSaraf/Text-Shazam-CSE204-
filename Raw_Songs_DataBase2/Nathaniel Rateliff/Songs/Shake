Shake baby
I feel it when you
Shake baby
I really want to
Shake baby
Come on and just
Shake baby
Never gonna stop
Feel it when it's hot

Get on your knees and come to me now
I hope you really like to swing wild
Why don't we step just see now
Curl your lips gonna be while

Take off that dress don't make a scene now
Stick out your hip and squeeze me a while
Curl your back start to swing now
And let me think it's what you mean

Shake baby
I feel it when you
Shake baby
I really want to
Shake baby
Come on and just
Shake baby
Never gonna stop
Feel it when it's hot

Get on your knees and come to me now
I hope you really like to swing wild
Why don't we step just see now
Curl your lips gonna be while

Take off that dress don't make a scene now
Stick out your hip and squeeze me a while
Curl your back start to swing now
And let me think it's what you mean now

Shake baby
I feel it when you
Shake baby
Come on and just
Shake baby
I really want to
Shake baby
Come on and let's
Shake baby
I love it when you
Shake baby
Come on and just
Shake baby
I love it when you
Shake baby
Never gonna stop
Feel it when it's hot
Never gonna stop
Feel it when it's hot
