Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know

You're loud and run your mouth
You aim to turn around
I know it ain't that way, but anyway

You set a wildfire, you think it's cut its path
But the wind just turns and laughs at you
You held me when I had nothing to say
Well, some things are lost on truth

Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know

You held the seeds that you think would turn to grass
But the days of growth have passed for you
We had all eyes on and man, I get so put out
Hearing the lies you do

Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know
Even now, you let me down
You're still so put out
Don't talk too much to me, maybe I don't even want to know
