Lately I've been feeling this way, tell me if I'm wrong
Only thing I felt in weeks, is when I leaned in to know

Singing, Love don't treat ya like that
Nope when it's around
Love won't treat you like that
No honey no

Hey Mama, can't stand around and sing
Hey baby, where we gonna be
Hey Mama, I'm tired of what I see
And I can't bother to wait if people don't want to change

Saying, Love don't treats ya like that
Don't tell me I don't know
I know that love won't treat you like that
I won't let go

Ain't it time now when we rise up and we fight it
Say you're a lover man
Then tell me why why why what's it gonna take to know that

Love don't treat ya like that, babe I'm letting you know
Saying love don't treat ya like that ya I know

Only thing I wanted was to try and find a new way
Lately I've been feeling that it might be the ending of days

Saying, Love don't treat ya like that, just don't let go
Ya love don't treat ya like that, I'm letting you know

It's a time we find a new way
Even if they come from all sides
They trying to turn us in to criminals
Well come anyway
And you wondered how
Take me, I won't hesitate to tell them
That Love won't treat ya like that babe I'm letting you know

Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know

We're preyed upon in their little game and we cry
Deep in the night deep in your woes
Baby I can't let em and I won't let go

There's a line in the sands
I think we'll have to cross it man
If if I got got ttttell ya
Tell ya why why why why why

Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that babe I'm letting ya know
Saying love don't treat ya like that I'm not letting go
