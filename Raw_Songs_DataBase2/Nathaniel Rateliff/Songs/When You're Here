When you're here
When you're out
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
When you feel
When you doubt
And when all of this fails
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
Don't you get heavy, hanging around
Don't you get tired of me
When you're here
When you're down
I wanna know it
I wanna know it
Don't you get up when too quickly then you're out
Don't you get off it and really leave me out
Don't you get tired of hanging around
Don't you get tired of me and the sound
