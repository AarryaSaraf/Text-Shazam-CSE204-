One single out of ten
Seen better odds in them
But it's not that bad

Well me
I was digging with my crutch
I stand in my own rut
That I wrote down

While you
You just sit and stare
It's not pealing it's a tear
And it's distance and it's where
It's getting under my skin

But a wave
Could carry you away
Or leave you somewhere else
Or leave you in the flames
So let the dirges ring
I'll be there to burn with you

We're all broke down
We're all well hid
We're all just kids
Despite our age

Look
You see this broken hand
Oh it's just another limb
Well not to me

And you
Don't listen you just talk
Well leave me in the dark
I don't wanna know

Now a wave
Could carry you away
Or leave you somewhere else
Or leave you in the flames
So let the dirges ring
I'll be there to burn with you

They don't call my name anymore
They don't wrap themselves in a song in the night
They don't call us all that we are
After all, we got nothing to show for
After all, we got nothing to show for
After all, we got nothing to show for
