Been there always
Could be there again
Bended all ways

To Bend it back again

It's a truce
Standing toe to toe
Yeah bold
To throw in the first blow
To leave a couple teeth to spit out

We swam out away
I hope we don't start to cramp
At least it's not a raise
Can always float on our backs

Well Its true
Its true in what they say
It's a hoax
And you don't even know
You just laugh
Laugh and when you don't
You just stare
And it's not even there
Its a joke
And it's always a big deal

To people it don't matter at all
They call in all the folks that you know
And their voice is always so very small

If we lend our gaze
Its light can not come back
So hold your breath Babe
There's always one more left
We set a good pace
Its a kind of sort of thing that always wins
And when we finally cross the line
We're dragging behind
Your stroke will be the least that defines
There is always a distance between a shout and a whistle
Between a shout and a whistle
Between a shout and a whistle
