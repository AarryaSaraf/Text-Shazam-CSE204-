It's getting bright man,
squinting staring at the sun.
Just look at your burned skin
and try to tell me that I'm wrong.
Your laboring promise,
was anything but heavy work.
Is this all you've done then?
It took hours just to find the words.

Well, give me some time
I've been mulling around
and kicking it's teeth in the dirt.
I've got a feeling,
a sleeping depression,
that somebody's gonna get hurt.

Well, oh ya.
Well, they won't even mind.

This great succession
is a wound that never wants to heal.
Begging your pardon,
if I kinda like the way it feels.

You'll have to choke down,
the dust of me left in your mouth.
You got the harness,
so where you gonna drag me now?

Well, give me some time,
I've been mulling it around
and kicking it's teeth in the dirt.
And, I think it's pulling right for the bruisin'
and somebody's gonna get hurt.
Well, they won't
have to suffer me no more.
