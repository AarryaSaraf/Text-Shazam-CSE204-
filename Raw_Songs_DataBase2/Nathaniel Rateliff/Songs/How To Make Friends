I was on the short list
Of people most hated
You were right above me
Or no one ever told you
I'm content to lay here
How'd we ever come to be so stiff?

Maybe I should crawl out
Hide myself in the waves of doubt

Everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you
When everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you

Never to confront you
Man, but who would really want to?
We could write a letter
For them to read together
You hate because you're lazy
And me, I've always been afraid

Well, no one really sold you
You really got your hands in you

Everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you
When everybody knows you
Nobody's gonna want you

Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you
Everybody knows you
