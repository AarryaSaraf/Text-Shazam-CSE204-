I'm on the run
Aimming too low
Breaking away
On the feet of you all
And catchin the stone
With a side of my head

Hold me back
Walking it home
I'm taking the tracks
So leave me alone
You can see me fall
Faster than
You can run

Take it away
If you're feeling it's wrong
Kicking it back
Watch it dissolve
Tug on the line
Chained to the wall
I heard you call
We're not gonna make it at

Running
Will do you no good
I'm gonna fall
I probably should
Well catch me
You never could
I planned out the distance
From where you stood

When I hit the ground
Gonna laugh out loud
Gonna lay there a while
And stare at the clouds

Baby it looks bad
Or maybe from the angle I'm at
Well I tear off my shirt
And wrap it around
Your wound
