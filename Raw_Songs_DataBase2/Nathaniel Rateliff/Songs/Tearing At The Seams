Wait, did you think that I would break underneath the pressure and the...

Now the heart if not to feel
Is a wandering waste in the driest land
Now form these heights of this hills
There's a funny thing that no one else can see

There's a liar, a liar on the stage with a young child's eyes
And it happens all wrong and only half of its seen from here

Where has all the time gone
In separate ways it runs long
A hundred miles built upon us
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been
Tearing at the seams of all that's been

Wait, is this a game or am I walking into a snare?
Now these lies will spread until we are choking on the innocent

They have half of us tied and half of us in chains
We're all covering our eyes and covering our mouths just the same

Where's all the time gone
In separate ways it runs long
A hundred miles built upon us
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been
Tearing at the seams of all that's been
It's tearing at the seams of all that's been

They're gonna have to drag us away...
