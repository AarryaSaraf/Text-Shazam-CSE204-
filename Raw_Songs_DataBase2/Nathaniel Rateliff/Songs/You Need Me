It's like you're telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Or are you telling me now in the middle of the set it's through?
Or did I walk by and never saw it, maybe
Or I was reading my lines and I never heard my cue?

Running to the top of the hill, then the hill starts over
You can bury yourself in the ground that you dug up
Now I was just contemplating
When do the tears dry up?
Far too easy to bait me
At least we shared the cup

Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Or are you telling me now in the middle of the shit fuck you
I'm the only one left on the sinking boat not believing
And you were calling from the water and screaming back it's true

Start looking around and seeing it's far too easy
You could lose a limb in a snare you set for yourself
Now don't you try to fool me
When you're dumb, you don't fear as much
If it's gonna be that simple
I'd rather do it drunk

Stumbling 'round until you're queasy
You're losing your hair but you've got friends
And if it's gonna be that simple
I've got a long way to go to never again

Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
Are you telling me now in the middle of the shit I need you?
