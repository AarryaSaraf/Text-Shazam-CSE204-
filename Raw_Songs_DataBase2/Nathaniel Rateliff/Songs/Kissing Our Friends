Have you found your bed
Or somewhere you want to sleep?
As I rub my neck
Thought the stiffness would never leave

They say that wintertime is calming
But it sure hurts my hands
I ran the water for your bath
But you never came in

If you and I get too lonely
We start kissing all our friends
If you and I get too lonely
Remember we'll both still care

You and I get too lonely
Start kissing all our friends
If you and I get too lonely
Remember we'll both still care
