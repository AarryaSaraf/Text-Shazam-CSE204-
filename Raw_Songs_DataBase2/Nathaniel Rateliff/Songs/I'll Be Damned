We were staying home to get away
Tryna loose through the hole but it's still too late
Don't sigh on me
don't size me up at all
We were back in awe with a bellyache
You can sit in a hole, you can say you believe
I'm in awe
I'm forgetting everything

Well, don't corner me
Ya got nerve to be
Goddamn, your broke feeling's such a foolish thing

See it's good to be out and alone in the world
'Cause nobody cares, and they never did anyway

You can pack that notion in a hate
You can blank my face, ya can bury me
I'm one and all
I'm one on every side
We were spinning in, we were outta date
You been giving it hell or so you think
I'm barrelin' in
I'm barely here at all

You think it's a funny thing
You think it's sex all day
Goddamn ya, Goddamn ya
It's got all of me
Or at least their teeth
It don't bother me
It don't bother me

See it's good to be out
And alone in the world
'Cause nobody cares
And they never did anyways
