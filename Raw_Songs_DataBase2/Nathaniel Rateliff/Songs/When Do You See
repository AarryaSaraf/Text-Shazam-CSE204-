Come in and see, I got a long list of things
Remember, I can't read, we'll have to go through them slowly
And in this freeze you'd be lucky to make it a mile
So let me see and find us something warm to wear

All I got is pages we can burn to warm ourselves
I kind of get discouraged from crawling on my hands

If it feels alright, maybe come over here
I've been in a fight and I've got some wounds that you can attend
I own my days just as much as I own my nights
In my poor face, it's so swollen I'm losing sight
I don't want to brag, but we made it out alive

Babe when I come home, well tell me you want me
See you've been alone and it feels like forever
When you're not there to hold, I just feel empty

I don't know about friends, it's just hard up sometimes
Forget your sins, we're all prone to fall in flames
And even if you fall, when do you see?
Even if you fall, when do you see?

Well, tell me when do you see?
Well, tell me when do you see?
