It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to control you

Like the other little children
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin'
Or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you

And it's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you

And when you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies 'til they're gone
And then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire 'til the dawn

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway
Oh, I can't be there to console you

And when you go out to play this evenin'
Play with fire flies 'til they're gone
And then you rush to meet your lover
And play with real fire 'til the dawn

It's not supposed to be that way
You're supposed to know that I love you
It don't matter anyway
If I can't be there to console you
