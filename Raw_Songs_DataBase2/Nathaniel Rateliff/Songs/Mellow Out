Someone came in rushing dragging feet and nails and I could pretend
Wanting more of nothing feel it wearing on me
Just keep it hid

Mellow out and find a better way you're feeling it shut down
Take it easy baby maybe find some time to just calm down
Keep on telling me

Laid a scarring on me I was thinking maybe I got it in
I could hand it to you it doesn't matter if you're not in the biz
Way to pressure till it's looking like it finally broke down
Let's bury it together and maybe find some time to just sit down
Keep on telling me

Mellow out and find a better way you're feeling it shut down
Take it easy baby maybe find some time to just calm down
Keep on telling me
