He's a manic boy
Looks a lot like me
Looks a lot like me
And he shares the blame

With a younger face
It's hard and rushed to see
And it's hard for us to see
But I can tell

Is it cold enough
Does it chatter your teeth
And the wind won't set you free
And it never has

Like an old time revival
Shake your hands, and shake your hips
Put up all my armour
Let me stand bear, with just two fists
