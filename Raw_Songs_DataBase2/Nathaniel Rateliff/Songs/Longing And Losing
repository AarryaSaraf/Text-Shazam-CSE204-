I must be our ruin
I must dead iron
Don't short-sight it's worth
It comes to steal mine
It comes as it always has
And in keeping me hid
There must be
Peace in the morning
Peace in the night
Peace in the daylight
Let it out stand forever
Does it outstand so plight
May it wash all us over
And its back-breaking crime
Let it cast me far forward
'Til the end of my life
There must
Be peace when eyes are open
Peace her eyes to find
Let us rest till it's over
Let us soak up the healing
Tonight
