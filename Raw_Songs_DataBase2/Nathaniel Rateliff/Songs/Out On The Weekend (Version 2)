Out on the weekend
I was standing in the corner
Laughing about
You can follow the rain or let the tears come out
It's standing right over you
Out on the weekend

I remember carrie farro
I was to old to dance
Always find the beat and the time
She talking out all the traps
Man she knew all the steps
With the fall and rise
She had a feel for it all
The fall and the raise she had a feel for it all

Out on the weekend
Send the children to bed and let the drinks come out
We'll play favorite records and kiss on the mouth
All our friends are over, yeah
Out on the weekend
I remember Jack and Nicole
Man, they were the perfect pair
They always brought to sleep on the ground
Man they were that perfect sound
Laughing until the sun come out
He'd run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
He'd run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
I remember I was feeling alone remembering you
I remember that the world could fall
But, what was I to do babe
Out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah
Baby out on the weekend, oh yeah

I remember so many things with you
Out on the weekend
