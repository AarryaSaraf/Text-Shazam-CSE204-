You're looking thin anyways
And you stare right through me
Surprised to be leg to leg

Is there a place we could run
And you could hide with me
And take our time doing nothing at all

We got tungsten rope tying us down
And this tiny crown
Will be our shield for hope and love

And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
Until we're gone

Pretend you're the wind
Pretend I'm the sun
And how warm I make
How warm I make
Your air

And if it's not too much love
Cover my eyes for me
It's a bright morning
And we're waking up

And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
And I won't know where we're going
Until we're gone

Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
Even when they got us pinned, we're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
We're laughing
