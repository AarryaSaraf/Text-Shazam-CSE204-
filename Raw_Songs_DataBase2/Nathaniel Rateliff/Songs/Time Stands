For a moment I could wait to see it fall apart
Every empty bed in every city I've been
I sit and contemplate all the moments you said
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

What's that you used to say? Find a love that you can wait for
Or do you feast upon the weak and weary of heart?
I can take the pain but I can't take all the hatred
Laziness of mind and simplest of thoughts

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Now you're pouring out your hate at every difference you found
You won't even listen to reason at all
Not questioning your faith, far be it from me
But you would speak of love while tying ones hands

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Now lean and use your weight
That's what a shoulder's made for
Carry all the dead and children from here
Curses on the men and the greed that seems to plague them
I can't raise my hand so I'm raising my voice

Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you

Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
