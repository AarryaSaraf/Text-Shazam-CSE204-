Sometimes you don't say it
sometimes you don't want to
and I didn't  you
I didn't ask you

Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easy but you just don't say

Sometimes you just wait
sometimes you just wait through
And when you're naked
I wanna be next to you
All that I want and I feel so fine
Get on your knee, so I can tell you

Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easier, I wanna say
Tell me that I'm more than I am
What if I'm falling?

So I didn't take it
I didn't have to take you


Tell me I'll be boiled away
Easier, I wanna say
I, I, I
