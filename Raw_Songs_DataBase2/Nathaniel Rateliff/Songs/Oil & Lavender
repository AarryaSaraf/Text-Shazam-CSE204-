And being outside your wisdom
And stretching the truth
I was the oil and lavender
But never for you
You had to toil and sit in
The sun browned your skin
It burned all the alabaster
Till the ash choked the wind
They say it's the longest light
To ever have shown
They say it's the longest lie
And that nobody knows
They say it's the longest lie
And I still taste the smoke
Now only ungrateful remember 
To sleep in the stone
With all of your grace and thunder
The roll and the boom
I was the cloak and dagger
That snuck into you
And we have but one (left) finger
That's pointing at us
And that would be the longest night
That chilled  to bone
That would be the longest night
To sleep here alone
That would be the longest night
I think you'd be warmer closer to me
