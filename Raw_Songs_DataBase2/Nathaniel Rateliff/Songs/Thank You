Spend your years
Spend your time
With all these tears
Not all were mine

I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
Sweet baby for getting me through

Can't hide your fears
I can't hide mine
In spite of all this dear
I think we're fine

I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
Pretty baby for getting me through

I was looking back their Lord
Could have been no one else
I would have been so cold
Laying here by myself
Ever since you found me yeah
Never be anybody else
Yeah baby yeah

I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
I just want to thank you
Sweet baby for getting me through
