Well, you just think that I'm
Some great survivor
And you just build upon
The lies that carry you
Well, I don't even talk that way
See, I wanted you to stay
And show you the world's a better place
And as we crawl to find our way
We even take the shape of something else

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor

I'm afraid that the weight of the world is catching up with you
I'm afraid to admit that it's catching up to me, too

Well, you just think that I'm
Some great survivor
And you just feed upon
Fear you created
Some people ought to see
Some people ought to hear, hear
Some people ought to see
Some people ought to hear, mmm
Well, if it's gonna be that way
Then the crowd that calls your name can cast me out

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor

I'm afraid that the weight of the world is catching up with you
I'm afraid to admit that it's catching up to me, too
Does the weight continue to grow until it buries you?

You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
You think that I'm just
Some great survivor
