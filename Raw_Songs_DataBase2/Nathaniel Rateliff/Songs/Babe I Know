Babe I know it swirls around me
Like the sun shines on the coast
Like a weathered torn once sturdy barn
I used to give you shelter and warmth

It's clear I can see the dry grass at my feet
As we wait to go, you come home and I'll say
Baby I know

Babe I know, baby I know
That the course has drifted here
As we swim to land with our mouths full of sand
And say, baby I know

I'm all tired and my throats so dry
I feel I'm barely holding on
I'm gonna sit around here with this abscessed fear and say
Baby I know

Now there's something that I want that I'll never be
Burned out full of love
Now sometimes I lay here half awake and say, baby I know
Now sometimes I lay here half awake and say, baby I know
