Out on the weekend
I was standing in the corner
Laughing about
You can follow the rain or let the tears come out
It's standing right over you
Out on the weekend

I remember Carrie Farro
She was never too old to dance
Always found the beat and the time
Taking out all the taps
Man, she knew all the steps
The fall and the rise, feel for it all
The fall and the rise, feel for it all

Out on the weekend
Send the children to bed, let the drinks come out
Play our favorite records, kiss on the mouth
All our friends are over
Out on the weekend

I remember Jack and Nicole
Man, they were the perfect pair
They always brought a blanket to sleep on the ground
Man, they were that perfect sound
Laughing until the sun came out
Run his hands through her hair and she just smiled
Run his hands through her hair, she just smiled

Out on the weekend
Another late night party, all her friends came out
And we all got naked in the pool, but who cares now?
I remember so many things with you
Out on the weekend
