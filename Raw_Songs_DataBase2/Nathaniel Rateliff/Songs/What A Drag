Ain't it a drag, babe
You feeling so safe
But you cannot hear or ignore

Here's where the crash lands
Not as graceful as one thinks
So brace for things you don't know

I left
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
But you can undo it, man

You seem surprised, babe
After years of the same thing
Well, I hope it's the half that you want

There's not a last dance
And no one really wins
So you cannot hold in your cries

Open your eyes
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
I left
I left feeling alone
But you can undo it, man
