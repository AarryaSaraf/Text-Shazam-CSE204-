If you call our names
We'll come arise and ready and primed
Such a sturdy face
You can tell we're aging by the lines
Keep on saying how
That's sort of fine and strange, although
Even if the wind has ceased to blow
We won't run and we won't cry
Look how we stand forever more, when we could
Staying up and laughing all night, when we could
Keep on smiling till it's bright, when we could
When we could
You sure called it right
You said I'd wither and not grow back
It's not a fine way to go
I think we left there with our pride
I hate to call out hands
But pardon my way of being slow
Cover me up and let me go
And make it as thick and as dark as the night
And we could laugh forever more, when we could
Tear it up like the dogs at night, when we could
And we could fight and bury it all, when we could
When we could
When we could...
