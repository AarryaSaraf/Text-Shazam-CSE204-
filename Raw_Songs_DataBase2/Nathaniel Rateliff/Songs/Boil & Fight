I was taking long in lane
While they boil and fight
While they boil and fight
I was taking all my days
And all night
And all night
Maybe you skip and walk
Maybe you tap your heels
It won't matter at all
If you just stand still
Taking it off, see how it feels
Taking a long way through the fields
Honey that's alright
Maybe you're too tired to wake
Well rub your eyes
Rub your eyes
I could try to tell you what it is
Well it's more than hi
Well it's more than hi
We got em off the ground again
We gonna wait till the sun lets us in
We got along fine without any friends
We got a long ride to think about it
