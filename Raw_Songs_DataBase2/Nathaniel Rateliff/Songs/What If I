What if I just can't discover?
What if I'm just taking too long?
Or I'm wrong, my vision is cluttered
I'm stumbling on

What if I just quit tomorrow?
What if I just tuck and run?
If there ain't no line to follow
Well, how will you know?

What if I can't wait any longer?
But I'm scared of letting it show
And of all this piled together
The least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see when you cannot believe
When only half the cards are shown
Maybe as time goes on together
We'll learn how to grow

What if I can't take the heartache?
What if I don't want to know?
What if all I found was darkness leading to none?

Well, come on, just leave the light on
Give me air and clear the room
'Cause if I don't find an answer
I fear I'll fold

What if I can't wait any longer?
And I'm scared of letting it show
And of all these piled together
The least is the most

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe the nights are sharp and cold
Maybe it's harder to see what you cannot believe
When only half the cards are shown

Maybe as time goes on together, we'll learn how to grow
Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
Maybe I'll go on without it

Maybe I'm all in and doubt it
