Said you can't find no water
Said you can't find your feet
Maybe it's turned the corner or maybe it's not for me
If you had a lover would you bring them back to me
I can't find you honey, but I want you to dance with me

Meet me by the corner, I know a place to go
Maybe we'll love each other
Maybe I don't know

Meet me by the corner, I know a place to go
Maybe we'll love each other
Maybe I don't know
