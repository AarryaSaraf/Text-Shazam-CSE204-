You keep changing your mind for so many reasons
From what I can tell
You just might as well
Lay down and choke on your own

I can't give you enough to just keep believing
This shit don't run well
It's burned out as hell
And it's trying so hard not to know

You're filling it up just to turn out on empty
God damn I know just how it feels
I'm gonna tear out all that's inside me
Look away from here
Cause nobody cares
And they're trying so hard not to know

You take all of you want haven't found any answers
Look down and stare and I run around and yell
That it might not rain any more

You never stand up long enough to pull it together
Well who gives a damn and very few can
When they're trying so hard not to know
