This heart singing out to me sings alone
This world and empty room and it's falling into line
They say just one will pass and one will leave no mark or burn

This heart is singing on and on again
This heart a wielding hammer ready to pound
This world already defined
Maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't even know

This wheelless motion will not define me
This softly singing madness is singing out aloud
This awful and unholy awful man

Inside your empty hand
And it's eating out the worm
It's odd and it's hard to hail
Or maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't know

This eye-line wandering ragged doll
This one leg pony pulling out the plow
This wondering what will be my own
And if nothing else I'll seek to find

That hairy old delight
A naive dark night
This heart is singing to you
Singing I was
This all a weight on me
Maybe you don't even know
Maybe you don't even know
