Do you think your a man to talk?
Do you think I mind at all?
Don't say...
How he was livin it up in a run...
Do you want to be the hammer?
Against broken necks unbent
You got hooks in me that stretch my skin
Like it was some old Indian dance
But wait...
I think you finally found a way to get into me
And hey...
I might be cut in half
Awwww, there's big confusion at the border to nowhere
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb?

Are you tryin to tan my hide?
Is there a spoon and salt behind the door?
Or do you pour it on the floor to get down?
I'm just another lamb on the stone
Grill the meat right to the bone
And feast on it
Or do you throw it to the foul of the air?
But wait, I thought you wanted me to let up the anchor
And hey, why do you tie it to the rope around my neck?
Awww, is this a cause for your mission and virtue?
Hey, what's the trouble with softness of skin?
I'm just another one to hide in the corner
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb

But wait, I thought you wanted me to let up the anchor
And hey, why do you tie it to the rope around my neck?
Awww, is this a cause for your mission and virtue?
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb
And hey, are you makin it out on a limb?
