Here in the nighttime as it calls
Deepens the skyline until the dawn
It's like heaven sings in the wind
We watch the sunrise upon your skin

Well, I don't think I'm the better man
And it's in these hours that we fade
Will you hold me tight when you're close and then?
Will you love me when I'm worn out and I start to cave?

These kind of moments come in waves, you know
Some take your breath and fill your days
It's a powerful love you want to know
Ah, as we walk hand in hand
I'm just here to say that ya

We want back time that we never have
Hours just turn into days
To love me now like you loved me then
And will you love me even when you know that I'm wrong?

We want back time that we never have
And the hours just turn into days
To love me now as you love me then
Can you promise that it never fades?
If I run out of things to say
I'm lost and I can't find my way
But I still keep calling your name
If you love me, love me, love me until I'm gone
