Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

It was 75 the time of the preacher
When the red headed stranger appeared
Rode into town blue eyes a shining
And his memories measure in tears

Hey Nashville, Hey Austin
He's singing the songs we hold dear
Now for all of these years

So pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Now shotgun Willie wades through whiskey rivers
Living in the promise land
His heroes are cowboys and the songs there a singing
Bring joy and laughter again

Hey Georgia, New Orleans
This songs for your native son and all that he's done

So pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Pass me that joint it's Willie's birthday
Wipe away all of your tears
Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here

Well the worlds gone crazy
But we still got Willie
And all the good things he's done for us here
