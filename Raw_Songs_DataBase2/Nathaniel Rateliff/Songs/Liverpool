I wish I could know it when
But it don't seem right, hang on
Really it's just in time, and you know it when
It'd have to fade in the night
Do you still sleep on your side

How can I be so far dead
Leaning on one side
I wrote it down but can't remember it
Ain't that the story of our lives
And there's one more prayer and goodnight
And we'll be dead and it turns night
And we'll forget it all in time
