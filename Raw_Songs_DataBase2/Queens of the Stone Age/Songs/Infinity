Got a hole in my head
Everything falls right out
Through my ears, through my eyes
Makes no difference where you are
You wanna know how I do it?
I do it all right

I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing can fill it up
I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing

A new wrong
A new wrong
A new wrong
A new wrong
You never get right back
A new wrong
You never get right back
A new wrong

You wanna know how I do it?
You wanna know how I do it?
You wanna know how I do it?
I do it all right

I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing can fill it up
I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing out there

Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
So I sing, uhhh
