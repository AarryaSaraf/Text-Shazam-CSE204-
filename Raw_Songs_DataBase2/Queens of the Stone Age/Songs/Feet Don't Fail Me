Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on

I was born in the desert, May 17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove
I commence to moving
I was chasing what's calling me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter
One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Life is hard that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
Footloose and fancy free

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
On and on and on and on and

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, on a one-way line
That's the sound that's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's

Time to go, regret it later
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We take the long way home

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do whatcha gotta do
Oh do it now
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on
