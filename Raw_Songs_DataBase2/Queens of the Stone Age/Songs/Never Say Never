If time itself was his demeanor 
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer 
Of sunlight landin' on the street 
Sunsuit girls must be discreet 

Sunsuit girls must be discreet 
Nursing their fathers locked inside 
They masqueraded as his bride 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

Slumped by the courthouse 
With windburned skin 
That man could give a fuck 
About the grin on your face 
As you walk by, randy as a goat 
He's sleepin' on papers 
When he'd be warm in your coat 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

There's no easy way to lose your sight 
On the street, on the stairs 
Who's on your flight 
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin 
But he's got her and she's got him 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

Never say never 
Never say never 
Never say never 
Never say never
