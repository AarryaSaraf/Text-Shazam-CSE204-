Got guns, do you wanna
Take aim at each other?
Scratch the itch? Give the finger?
'Cause we don't care
Anyway
Got knives, have you seen 'em?
In your back's where we keep 'em
And you're never gonna reach 'em
Now that sounds fair

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could

Boy, little town
Little king, little crown
Hope you give, hope you give
Why don't you just give in?
Come on, take it with a smile
At the bottom of the pile
You can beg, you can plead
It won't take a thing

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Oh, how could you win
Against yourself again?



How you like your position?
You ain't Robert Mitchum
You're ten pounds of shit
In a five pound bag

Oh, this is bound to be good
You can't, but you thought that you could
Oh, how could you win
Against yourself again?
