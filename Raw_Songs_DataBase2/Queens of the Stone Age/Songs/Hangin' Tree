Would you like a way home?
I'll bleed my own

'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one

'Round the hangin' tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swaying

Can you see under my thumb?
There you are

'Round the hangin' tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one

'Round the hangin' tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swaying

'Round the hangin' tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one

'Round the hangin' tree
Swaying in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one
Swaying
