// Emotion Sickness //

Use once and destroy
Single servings of pain
A dose of emotion sickness
I just can't shake
Then my fever broke

No possessions, just your flesh on
See the sights, Holy Braille
Feel as you might, oh ah-ah
Rip some pieces free

Oh, atrocious! F-ferocious!
Check the price
Alibi bye buy by the slice
Absolutely

Baby don't care for me
Baby don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

Baby don't care for me
Baby don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

Gonna vacuum all the perfume
Hit the lights, keep your shit out of sight
Giving me the creeps

Wanna chew gum, go on, get some
Put up a fight?
Well, let's have it right now

Baby don't care for me
Baby don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life? Possibly
I don't really know

A flick of the switch
So smooth and clean
How we grow is so painful, believe you me

Then my fever broke
Then my fever broke
Then my fever broke

Baby don't care for me
Baby don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life? Possibly
I don't really know

Baby don't care for me
Baby don't care for me
Had to let her go, oh

People come and go on the breeze
For a whole life? Possibly
I don't really know, oh
