// The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret //

Well I've got a secret, I cannot say
Blame modern movement to give it away
You've got something, that I understand
Hold it in tightly, call on command
Leap of faith, do you doubt?
Cut you in, I just cut you out

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

Look for reflections in your face
Canine devotion, time can't erase
Out on the corner or locked in your room
I never believe them and I never assume
Stuck in belief, there is a lie
Promise is promise, an eye for an eye
We've got something to reveal
No one can know how we feel

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell

I think you already know
How far I'd go not to say
You know the art isn't gone
And I'm taking our song to the grave

Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone
Whatever you do
Don't tell anyone

// Leg Of Lamb //

You're a head case with a smile
Can't stop to make up your mind
Education is so lame (It's so lame)
When you bitch and you moan
You're a loose girl, I'm a guy (Hey)
You're a truth freak with a lie
The situation is so strange
It's a TV show (Click)

In a hotel on the phone
You're gonna leave me, I should've known (Should've known)
And I was thinking, it's so sad
I didn't want you to go, oh
You want to follow the laws of man? (Yes sir)
Bloody apron, leg of lamb
It's so hard to win
When there's so much to lose

Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
This ain't reality

Infiltrate the walls that are caving in
It ain't a bad thing
Think of it as natural (Ah)

Second Avenue, raising Cain
I'm a sinner, ring my bell (Ring mine)
I'll tell you what, I'd get up
If I knew I had fell

// Auto Pilot //

Saw you lying there on the marble slab
It'd be the best trip that I've ever had
Higher than a jet plane, pass it around
My drinks on empty, need another round

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you

Will we arrive in the middle of nowhere?
Don't act like you know I been here so many times
I never seen you before
But now that I have, I don't want to see you no more

High up in a jet plane with you
High up in a jet plane with you

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you

Ah-ah, auto pilot, no control
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, auto pilot, no control
Ah-ah, ah

High up in a jet plane with you
High up in a jet plane with you

I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
Is this the best that you can do?
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
High up in a jet plane with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you
I wanna fly, wanna ride with you

// Better Living Through Chemistry //

The blue pill opens your eyes
Is there a better way
A new religion's prescribed
To those without the faith
A hero holding a knife
And blood is not enough
Is it too late to go back?
Is it too late to go?

There's no one here (There's no one here)
And people everywhere, you're on your own

Let's see if I'm hearing this right
You suggest I should take
A never-ending supply
To carry out the day
Your idols burn in the fire
The mob comes crawling out
I'm reclaiming my mind
Destroying everyone

There's no one here (There's no one here)
And people everywhere, you're all alone

// Monsters In The Parasol //

The walls are closing in again, oh well
The walls are closing in again, oh well
I've seen some things I thought I'd never saw
Covered in hair (Hair)
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
Paul's dad is warped and bubbling, oh well
And my mind is out here on another wave
Covered in hair (Hair)

She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster (Distress) in your parasol (Why, yes)
You've got a monster (Divorce) in your parasol (Of course)
You've got a monster (Displeasure) in your parasol (My treasure)
You've got a monster (Your pain) in your parasol (Drives me insane)

Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
Paul's sister is an alien, oh well
I'd seen some things I thought I'd never saw
Covered in hair (Hair)

She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow
She won't grow

You've got a monster (Distress) in your parasol (Why, yes)
You've got a monster (Divorce) in your parasol (Of course)
You've got a monster (Displeasure) in your parasol (My treasure)
You've got a hole (Your pain) in you I never saw (Drives me insane)
In your parasol, in your parasol (Insane)

// Quick And To The Pointless //

I don't even know what I'm doing here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oh!

A little girl, walking down the street
Godverdomme, you gotta be with me
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Ah! Ah! woo!

Het leven is hard, de mensen worden bang
I'm so old, you're so young
I know, you know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn! Ah! Ah! woo!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Ik denk van ja, maar nee
Little girl, listen to what I say
You know, I know
Everybody, everyone, let's go

Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Oh baby, baby, you're so sweet
Goddamn! Ah! Ah! woo!

// In The Fade //

[In the Fade]

Cracks in the ceiling, crooked pictures in the hall
Countin' and breathin', I'm leaving here tomorrow
They don't know, I never do you any good
Laughin' is easy, I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothing to save and I know
You live till you die

Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know

Losing a feeling that I couldn't give away
Counting' and breathing', disappearing' in the fade
They don't know, I never do you any good
Stoppin' and stayin', I would if I could

Ain't gonna worry
Just live 'til you die, I wanna drown
With nowhere to fall into the arms of someone who
There's nothing to save and I know
You live till you die

Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know
Live 'til you die
I know

[Feel Good Hit Of The Summer]

Oh
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol (Cocaine!)
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, and alcohol (Cocaine!)
Nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana

// Tension Head //

Every day I wake up feelin' this way
I take it downtown, with all the action goin' down
I strike a match, strike a match, cook it up!

(High life) I'm feelin' so sick
I feel so fuckin' sick
(Low life)

On the bathroom floor
Gotta get out and get right
Hustlin' little girls
Cheatin' little boys

Gotta get out
Gotta get out and get right
I gotta get out
No more!
No more!
No more!

(My life) I'm feelin' so sick on the bathroom floor
(Your life) I'm feelin' so sick
No more!

(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life) I'm feelin' so sick on the bathroom floor
(Low life) Sick... no... no more

// I Think I Lost My Headache //

You know why
They called and just let it ring
No reply
The door was open I swear
Ain't no use in picking up
You know why

It's all my head I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Into my head it goes

Tastes so good
Oh, but I knew it would
Tastes so good
Burn like a match house
Medicate just to make you soft
Love is blind
Catch and release me
What the hell were they thinking of
You know why

It's all my head I know
So they tell me so
Until my head explodes
Into my head it goes

// Ode To Clarissa //

I knock on your door
I tiptoe on the floor
I hope your daddy ain't home right now
He warned me once before
You know he warned me once before
I stay up late
So we can keep our date
I love that we don't get no sleep
So through your window I creep
You know he warned me once before

I'm the one your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about
Woah! Woo, woah!

Now you're in love
And why shouldn't you be
I'm everything you'll never be
You say don't leave
Baby, I can't wait
Next stop: Michelle, my second date

I'm the one your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The one Your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
The one Your Mama told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm the one your Papa told you about (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

// You're So Vague //

Clear-eyed girl
In a crooked way
All the crooked walkin'
To avoid and evade
Hair like maple, skin like cream
Bet they say 'I love you'
When you strip them clean

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you

Green-eyed boys
Lick the razor blade
Girl, I think I love you (girl, I think I love you)
And the mess you made (and the mess you made)
Setting you up
It don't get you down
When you flash your fangs (Fuck!)
You own this town

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you (Ah!)

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you (Ah!)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
You're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)

// Never Say Never //

If time itself was his demeanor 
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer 
Of sunlight landin' on the street 
Sunsuit girls must be discreet 

Sunsuit girls must be discreet 
Nursing their fathers locked inside 
They masqueraded as his bride 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

Slumped by the courthouse 
With windburned skin 
That man could give a fuck 
About the grin on your face 
As you walk by, randy as a goat 
He's sleepin' on papers 
When he'd be warm in your coat 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

There's no easy way to lose your sight 
On the street, on the stairs 
Who's on your flight 
Old couple walks by, as ugly as sin 
But he's got her and she's got him 

I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
I might like you better if we slept together 
But there's somethin' in your eyes
That says maybe that's never
Never say never 

Never say never 
Never say never 
Never say never 
Never say never

// Who'll Be The Next In Line //

Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next in line for heartache
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you
Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next in line for you

Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next to watch your love fade
All your affections finally fade away
They'll be no use in sight
Who'll be the next in line for you

One day you'll find out when I'm gone
I was the best one you had
I was the one who gave you love

Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you
Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next in line for you

One day you'll find out when I'm gone
I was the best one you had
I was the one who gave you love

Who'll be the next in line
Who'll be the next in line for heartaches
Who'll make the same mistakes I made over you
They'll be no use in sight
Who'll be the next in line for you

For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
