Water drags
Water drags down
Dripping away your grime

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
Your secret lives
The outside looking in

A silhouette dragging through your minds
Clean your well
Catch up every once in a while

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
Your secret lives

The exterior world seeps in quicker than it used to
It all tends to catch up every once in a while
A collective theory of invisible destruction
Searching inward from the dangling lines

The exterior world seeps in quicker
Than it used to

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

I read your words
I smell your anxieties
Used to turn us against one another

A velvet room has a familiar smell
The shamed dirt spills against your walls
Beyond the looking glass

Watching and listening, plotting
I'll slither my way in and destroy from the inside
Beyond the looking glass

Clean it all away
Plotting and spinning
Clash with one another
Ravens used to speak like us
Peering in on the souls of Limbo City

The storm is coming
My storm is coming

Your secret lives
I'm on the outside
The outside looking in
Your fears and hopes, I take away
We multiply
We are driven by anger
Linked together through an irrational outlook

Lifelines are tethered in the blood of our eminent selves
You have it, we want it
I need it, you crave it
Give us more now

Our wills held against our complex truths
We are initially fed the same fears
Hooks in our backs, and impaled on the walls
Trapped in our geometric nests of not giving a fuck
We are initially fed the same fears
The ants on our backs, they have dropped from the sky

We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves
Lift and corrode, the beginning of remembering
Make us whole
Our decisions will fix the story
We will never be at peace until we separate ourselves

Lift and corrode
The beginning

Fade as time marches on
Fade as time marches on

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves

Your fears and hopes, I take
We multiply
Embrace our own decay
The storm is coming...
We will never be at peace with ourselves
Until we separate ourselves
