I hope I'm still here when you, you read this
I'm not the writer, but I've become the movement
That tore out my needs
I beg for the performance, and I never thought I would
The dark water
The horrid swells

The heart pounding stroll that opens a box
That always hid deep beneath my scattered eyes
I beg for the performance, and I never thought I would
The dark water
The horrid swells

Human is hell
I've tried to overcome this
Their hands keep dragging me down this hill
Human is hell
It seems to be miles long, years long
But we will "break on through" as he once said

Looking over the horizon
I realize that this is irrelevant
This is a small blip in the spectrum of our lives

Life
Human is hell, love is heaven
Life
God is sound and the sound still flows
Praise the uncertainty and collective brain
Life

Human is hell
Human is hell
Human is hell and we are accepting
Human is hell

Group initiation to help ourselves
(Mentally, telepathically)
"Sometimes I wish I was dead," is what was said
(Mentally, telepathically)
I realized the words came from my head
(Mentally, telepathically)
We are not meant to survive here
(Mentally, telepathically)
Leave your worries and your memories are not invited

Praise the uncertainty and collective brain
Brain
Collective brain
Brain
Grab my hand and we will see the future
Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved
With bleak reasonings and wretched smiles
Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved
With bleak reasonings and wretched smiles

Breathe in fresh air as nature keeps warning us

Never take this for granted
We have destroyed and we will pay
For what we have done
Human is hell

The air has been smoke, and the sun hides
As if its somber, somber reflection could not face
Could not face
What we have achieved
What we have achieved
Destruction
Abomination
It's in our wiring
It's in our wiring

Giving new life to the apparatus
I hope I'm still here when you read this

I'm not the writer
I've done nothing, nothing with time

A viewing glass so divine
A viewing glass so divine
A viewing glass so divine
So divine
Entwined in a fountain of evaporated youth

Admiring the sanity that keeps us human
The day dissolved

Sing with me, for today is gone
It's gone
Sing with me, for today is gone
It's gone
It's gone
