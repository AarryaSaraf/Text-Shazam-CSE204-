Everywhere I look, they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
Everywhere I look, they are there
What is everyone doing?
Going to a home?
To a place that makes us feel warm
A place that grants us a smile
Grants us a smile
Seems like a very simple idea, but not hardly figured out

I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
I just see faces
Faces staring blank as they go on with the routine
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this
This routine
Nothing new... it's time to go through with this

A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman
A spaceman
That's what they say I am
Nothing but a spaceman

Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call home
The journey begins... forcing a new life with the unexplained
A creeping rush that surrounds me
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away
Floating away

Always pushing it all away
Trying to get to that one place I call my home
My own planet... I allowed this wish
Unexpected... not knowing why
Now knowing why
Wonder why I question it now?
I'm my own planet

Not many can experience this sensation
Loneliness is creeping out
Or in, however you think of it
But it sure is surrounding me
Maybe all the complaining is an accurance of boredom
I suppose it's too late

I am floating farther
I am floating farther and farther away
I am floating farther
I am floating
I did love, I did laugh, I did live

A spaceman
They say I am... a spaceman
They say I am
A spaceman
They say I am... a spaceman
They say I am

Planets everywhere... my own destiny
I'm floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
I have become the sun of nothing
Nothing is here
Memories are not clear

I'm floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating towards the sun, the sun of nothing
Floating, floating, floating to the sun... farther away

I can't believe that's what it has come to
I never really had it all that bad
I just looked around and never thought about the blank stares
Blank stairs

They were looking into something much worse than what I thought I was
Selfishness is a very sticky quality of this species
Looking around... I don't see any faces
Yes, I am lonely
It's to be expected
It's to be expected

I'll sleep
