A rare delicacy
A dwindled spirit
Will we be forced to sing with the fear?

What will make it reinvent?
Will it end?
The first hearings
The moment everything changed

Creature feature
A monster on the big screen
Cinematic surprise
Entice the eyes
A hopeless murder

The notes that raised the brow
Sounds that brought back the dead
I'll just take my yearly dreamscape and pretend
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
