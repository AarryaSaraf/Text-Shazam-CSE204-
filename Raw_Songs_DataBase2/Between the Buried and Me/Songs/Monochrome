I'm not the writer
It's you
For I'm drenched in error and silhouettes
We've been on this same page before
Together
Forever
Together as one

I'm not the writer
It's you
For I'm drenched in error and silhouettes
We've been on this same page before
Together
Forever
Together as one

It's all happening
Embrace or implode
A vortex of doubts and fears
Colliding over and over again

Rearing heads
Fix the error
Investigate
Fix the error

The mire city is oozing the struggles of humanity
