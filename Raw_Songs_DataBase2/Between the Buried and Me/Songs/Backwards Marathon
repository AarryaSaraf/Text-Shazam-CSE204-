The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
This will never change I predict
But I do get tired
But I do get tired
This will never change I predict
But I do get tired
But I do get tired
If only they knew what push we have given
For this music
For this music
For this music
For this music
For this music
This happiness that keeps us all sane

Cold nights seem to force questions, not wanting to except these thoughts
I have worked and will keep working
To keep the tradition of my one true motive in life
Music
My only love
Once building drum boxes and pretending to be the artist
I guess I'm here but it feels weird
So weird
To know how weird all this can be
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned
I guess I'm here but it feels weird
So weird
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned
One day it will all come together
First place desire in the backwards marathon
One day it will all come together
That's all we can ask for
One day it will all come together
First place desire in the backwards marathon
One day it will all come together
That's all we can ask for

It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining

When the sun comes up, it's still raining
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow

When the sun comes up, it's raining, it's raining, it's raining
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Dance for the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Dance for the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
Dreams won't let go
Thoughts will not change
Can't watch it fly away
Dreams won't let go
Thoughts will not change
Can't watch it fly away
