Kleptomania
Hearsay is drawing blood
Nature has lost its solace
Welcome the scathing solution

Comfort is the sore beginning of tragedy
Our city has crept into your valley

A feeble human form
Spiraling down vacant streets
The metallic leaves slosh under its barren soles
Peering out
Rain slides down our cancerous skin
Burn, let the burn in
The advertisement - "Diminish Your Existence"

Our city has trashed your valley
Our city has scorned your maker

Neon trees are littered
Strangling the passing season
The old baron, too tall for the weak to survive
A carnal howl silenced
It cracks the surface of pestilence
The advertisement-

Our city has trashed your valley
Our city has scorned your maker

Comfort is the sore beginning of tragedy
Our city has crept into your valley
When are you from?
Where did we run?
Transcribing hope that quickly slips away
Slips away

"Remember the good ol' days?" The robot would say
Conjoin the collective day
Atomic family

Heal your mind
I enter bliss
Psychosis

Digital bath, scrubbing us clean
Feel the downfall
Exfoliate

We're our own leeches
The cycle continues
Ancient gardens seen in dreams
We're on our own leashes
Recycle

Turning black and secreting secrets
Of our past, the baron allows
Dropping the poison in our fountain
We all drink the collective doom
Recycle
Recycle our fear

Our city will crumble
Our city wears turmoil
Our damning God strikes down
We have scorned our maker

Nature seeps into concrete
It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
Between the buried and me

It's up to us to reshape this course
Between the buried and me
Between the buried and me
