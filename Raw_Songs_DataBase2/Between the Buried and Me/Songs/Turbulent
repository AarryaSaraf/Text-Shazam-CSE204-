Turbulent
We make it through
Weathered movement
Weathered movement
The clouds and storms
Weathered movement in time

We find ourselves
Turbulent

Get through this drab turbulence
The writer claims a scratching line

Keep up with it
A constant delay
A constant delay
Soon rectify
Accelerating the mind
Turbulent

Turbulent

Get through this
(Translate our own transmission)
Drab turbulence
(We've lived before and will once more)

The writer claims a scratching line
These ants will soon rectify

Sorry for the last week of bringing you down
(Get through this)
We make it through
My mind is to blame, my mind is to blame
(Drab turbulence)
The clouds and storms

The writer claims a scratching line
These ants will soon rectify our turbulence
Our turbulence
Get through this

Finding the calming path
Windless night into brighter lights
We find ourselves
We find ourselves

Their eyes follow you
Open the closed off circle
Their eyes follow us
Open the closed off circle
