Stuck in our last season
Bite off our headless fever

Drifting and melting
We hope you gravitate

Please don't wave back
I've severed (Once again) in transparency
Please just sit back
Devour (Once again) our broken disease

Kill the writer
Their eyes follow you
Open the closed off circle
Kill the writer
Their eyes follow us
Open the closed off circle

Sorry for the last week of bringing you down
My mind is to blame
My mind is to blame
What the fuck
Stuck in our last season
Bite off our headless fever

Dripping and melting
We hope you gravitate

Locked in a place of grief
I cannot find the proper balance
These odd rhythms, they are killing me
Yes, me and my brain
Drip and melt
Follow
I made it through

Sorry for the last month of bringing you down
My mind is to blame
My mind is to blame
What the fuck
Guilty memory
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Where's the bottom?
Keep falling

The future is behind our eyes
Annihilate cleansing
Disrupt
Erasing

The future is behind us

Born of a dream
I am
Born of a dream
We are lunatics

Open wide and let the pill slide down
Sink away from your nourishment

Sorry for the last year of bringing you down
My mind is to blame
