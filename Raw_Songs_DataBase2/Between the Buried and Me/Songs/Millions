Millions (millions)
Millions
Watch them fly overhead
Millions
Now please take me with you
(Take me with you)

I've lost my perspective
(Left me alone)
You left me alone

Alone and trembling
My chin (my chin) jolting back and forth
Sounds soar around
Sounds soar around
The shield you once were, you once were
My life you would defend
Sounds soar around
Sounds soar around

In my world there's only us
Bring me with you to soar
This dreadful collapsing scent...
You never strive for more

Millions fly overhead
Fog dancing slavery
Like snakes circling
Small angle jeopardy

Millions fly overhead
Fog dancing slavery
Like snakes circling
Small angle jeopardy

Millions
Millions

Millions
Millions

Millions
