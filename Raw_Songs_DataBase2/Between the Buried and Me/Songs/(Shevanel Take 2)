My head will not rest on this pillow
As it's gripped in my arms tonight
Like reality, too tight
If a dream could last forever
I would hold you here
Time need not freeze, I need not fear
This world inside
Is a world I have longed to find

And I will not be afraid to love
I will not be afraid to lose
What I once deprived myself of

My tear drops have salt-stained this pillow
As its loosened from my weakened clutch
Like the sun's light: too much
But there's a hope today
That I'll find a way
To make this dream a life and real to me

Sometimes I'll run and sometimes I'll crawl
Sometimes I'll fly and sometimes I'll fall
But this dream of mine will not change at all
