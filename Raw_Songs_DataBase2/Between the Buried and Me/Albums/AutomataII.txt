// The Proverbial Bellow //

[Night 6]

Let's stay here forever
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
A God-like floating sensation
Hands cover me
Jolting... erupting
Sensory bliss

I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?

The mark is spotted (the mark is spotted, they have found me)
They have found me (the mark is spotted, they have found me)
Found me, found me
Found me (electricity screams through the fingers)
Found me (through the fingers below)

I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?
I am I... what is this?

Move me to the ambulance of thought
Tiny electric movements

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss

I'm now elevated (I'm now elevated)
Yellow eyes stare below me (yellow eyes stare below me)
You/him/us: multiple versions of my inner search

The church of regret emits welcoming
Please don't shut us out
The red glow creates shadows... mountains
Shadows of our choosing

Lights in their eyes start flickering
The proverbial bellow

Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever
Let's stay here forever

Beautiful eruption... we've made our creation
Beautiful eruption... we've made our creation

Sunshine beams on their faces
As they melt into one
The slight hum of the grid
The slight hum of the grid

Sunshine beams on their faces
As they melt into one
The slight hum of the grid
The slight hum of the grid

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing

Please pick up... pick up the phone
It's been ringing for years now
I'm so alone here
Sensory bliss

// Glide //

[Night 4]

"May I have this dance?"... it nervously asks
The two glide into the heavy crowd
Awake this smile
Familiar...
The comfort of being
We are everything

Time is irrelevant while you're in my arms... maker
The grid is done and we all slowly collapse around each other
Piles of flesh and wires create a mountain of memory

// Voice Of Trespass //

Come a little closer now... let me tell you what you need:
A snake-tongued devil by your side

I will creep right through your mind and swim right through your veins
Let your blood flow over me

I want to dine in your mind
Trust me... we'll take it from here

Let's all hold these dreams in our broken hands of filth
Replace... begin... forget it all
Shut it off... now... all of it
I'll make you understand that they really are here and gone

I want to dine in your mind

Collapse on you
The inner rot
We are the Voice of Trespass

Voice of Trespass

We hang you out to dry
Dollar signs in your eyes
Crooked steps by design
You're going somewhere fast
It will never last
Disembowel your formal aim

I'll start slithering... my pockets are getting big... the dollars are in my eyes
The Voice of Trespass

We hang you out to dry
Dollar signs in your eyes
Crooked steps by design
You're going somewhere fast
It will never last
Disembowel your formal aim

Voice of Trespass

The lizard tongue snaps at its prey
Clinking glass of celebration... another puppet is lost in our world
Jolted out of their reverie
Enclosed / dispose / disclose
Break out... break free
The lizard tongue snaps at its prey

This is not perfection
Find yourself

Wake up
Please wake up

We are hollow
Condemned to the gallows

// The Grid //

[The Premiere]

Inhale... we take it all in
Prying hands mold... inhale
Prying hands hold
We shape you... you'll never know
Distinct cries for help rain down on our vice
The device inside
Prying hands become old
Rebirth

Inhale... we take it all in
Dying hands mold.. inhale
Dying hands hold
We break you... you'll never know
Distinct cries for help rain down

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed

Mental transformation
We have become their memory

Step back and feel the sun
Step back and touch the end
We are in this together

Millions circling

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed
Guilt surrounds... we pushed for a perfect life
We held you under and let you drown

Slowly submerge... become your true self
Rain down on our vice... the device inside
Prying hands become old
Rebirth

Judge not what we do, judge what we feed

Mental transformation
We have become their memory

The moon slides past the shoreline
Its crimson glows live on

Please don't wait up for me
I've finally locked the door
Please don't wait up for me
I can now move on

We are in this together
We are in this together
We are in this together
We are in this together

We are in this together
We are in this together
