// Mirrors //

Everything's a novelty
Everyone grows but me

Close one eye
Step to the side
Everyone grows but me

Everyone's in fragments
Close one eye
Step to the side

// Obfuscation //

From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem
An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge
From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem, as they seem

A brain malfunction we'll never admit as defeat, defeat
A constant determination to find truths, to find truths... to find reason
To find reason... to find truths... to find comfort
An unspoken religion in being the all dominant, all dominant, all dominant

This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain
This is what we call a brain... a brain

This step will allow, allow the universe to run its course
We have a short ticket and a lot is in hiding... so let's take in what we can for now
Just like here on Earth, a notion we do comprehend
Hide what "others" can't understand
The universe is the biggest, biggest threat... overachiever that commands attention
Brute force of hysterical, hysterical reasonings
There will always be a Marfa
Close one eye
Step to the side
Close one eye
Step to the side
As humans, we could never be content with knowing all
Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know
A mental surgery... a never-ending journey... a technological drawback
Pushing us further from our natural minds
There will always exist a Kryptos
Even things created by other humans should be considered
In the experiment of an entire species of understanding
A magician's pure joy
A mind bend for the common folk
Follow the straight line
A full house watching what we can't see
The ultimate deceiver
Close one eye
Step to the side
Step to the side
We will always be part of the great misdirect... stepping in and stepping out
We will always be part of the great misdirect... mirrors and Obfuscation

// Disease, Injury, Madness //

Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you
Every natural thought or feeling you've ever had will change tonight
Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you
Trust the pedestal, for now we become a higher being

I am your new mind
I am your new you
I am your new sin
I am your new lust
I am for you now
Control... and collapse... collide
Control... and collapse... collide
Control... and collapse... collide
Control... and collapse... collide
A letter plagued by a twisted word
Slave. You will become mine, for there are no more options
There will not be a sweet consolation... this is what is supposed to happen
A predetermined destiny put in motion by my stronger power, power
You are me

[Child:]
I sit on this dirty floor
A weak mind for a cause
A cause I do not know
Don't know what to live for
A compliment I've never heard
A comfort I've never felt... it's here, even though it won't last for long

[Man:]
Sit down
Stand up please
Lay down... drink this please
You'll be in peace soon
A tribe within itself
A vision I will display... to blind the caring
I have regrets
A tribe within itself
A vision I will display... to blind the caring

Too late

I am a cult by definition. I am a friend by first impression
My task: to recycle this earth
To not repeat human history
Start from scratch... rid every sound
Deconstruct
Deconstruct...all

I've bid every method into the hands of my employees
I have saved you
Now you will follow my journey... my destiny
Tonight's your death
Resurrect my new you
Resurrect my new you
I am a cult by definition
I will end this human world
This world is shit and I have proved this with my followers
Fuck humanity, end life
You are now dead, and I soon will be
You are now dead
Disease, injury
Disease, injury, madness

// Fossil Genera - A Feed From Cloud Mountain //

Sweet candy populous... a worry free entrance into the world's history
Never underestimate... never think beyond, beyond their thoughts
The satellites have been tapped and Cloud Mountain will carry on the commands of our ancestors
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease
Indeed we work from here
We have for centuries... hearing every breath... watching every disease
The leaders are driving to the farthest retreat
Sit back, relax, enjoy the ride
They have been speaking for years
Every night while you're asleep they have been discussing what the future holds for us all
The outer space takeover
The outer space takeover
Worlds collide in a dreary pre-determined idea brought by our fellow night owls
Their stories have been mocked... their ideas have been crushed
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out
Their ideas have been crushed
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out
A government overthrown
But after last night they control every idea we will think from here on out
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this
We have come to tell you all that we could have prepared for this, for this
The apocalypse, at least our apocalypse, will happen sooner than we think
If we don't read the journals our station has prepared for you all
We call ourselves the "night owls"
We've roamed the Earth for years and kept your world afloat
We've made it so you stay comfortable in your precious homes
While you sleep, we discuss
Discuss our future... your future
While you sleep, we discuss
Discuss our future... your future
Our journals give detailed instructions on the machines and weapons we must build
These are weapons that none of you would even begin to think could harm the outside world
Everything you know is false... your first instinct is now your last
Like I've said before... we have been discussing and planning this for decades
We don't have time to explain everything, but just know that everything will soon change, will soon change
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government
Trust us and we will all be safe
We are the new government

In simple times, we must take control
With simple skies, we create... more sky
A simple land we must change... for man... is god
A simple life we must break... move on
How fast we grow
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on
We must move on

// Desert Of Song //

The radio's stopped tuning
The static is forbidden
The chords quit strumming
But we found our new home
It will rain, falls so slow
It will rain down here

The drums quit thumping
These tones are forbidden
The throat can't start singing
The scarecrow is watching
It will rain, falls so slow
It will rain down here
It will rain, falls so slow
It will rain down here
Here, we're awake in the desert of song
The silence is broken
Here, we're awake and the
The silence is broken
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Here...we...sing
Sing with the fear
Fear: the control tower
The new sun comes by the hour
Ghosts slowly disappear in the fog
Silence the suffering
We've built back the age-old sound of song
Sound of song
Sound of song
Here...we...sing
Sing with the fear
Here, we're awake in the desert of song
The silence is broken
Here, we're awake and the
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Silence is broken
Here...we...sing
Sing with the fear

// Swim To The Moon //

It's been a long night... away from it all
The grabbing authority of my peers
The rusty cage that never seems to open
When can I escape?
When can I swim to the moon?
I've heard this expression my entire life... never realized how peaceful a statement it is
I've heard this expression my entire life... never realized how peaceful a statement it is
All alone on the worlds waters... here I am
The sun's slowly drifting past the edge of the world
All alone on the worlds waters... here I am
The sun's slowly drifting past the edge of the world
I'm the loneliest boat on this entire body of water
Rest will give my awakening purpose... this is why I have come here in the first place
A peace I have never felt... a life I did not want to live
I will awake through sleep
The drifting drifter... look into the picture
No more panic, no more regret
No more hoping for a new mess
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller

Swim to the moon

I awake with a cool breeze blowing through my dirty hair
Rested, stable... a first
A caffeine junkie's longest wish: peace and quiet
No wake ups, no expectations
A strange feeling... suddenly drifting
No wake ups, no expectations
A strange feeling... suddenly drifting
This "As Seen on TV" anchor is just another lie, I guess... hoping for something not there
Filling a void that I can't quite put my finger on
Filling a void
This loneliness I always seek
I'm in the middle of black water
No sign of human life in any direction
The most peaceful event of my life seems to have typically turned into a struggle
I'm in the middle of black water... no sign of human life
Panic takes over my body
Panic takes over my body, over my body
I have indeed floated due to a non-reversible decision to flee
Just for a day I told myself... my survival skills were lost years ago
Here I am: no food, no clean water, and this extremely embarrassing attempt at a "get away outfit"
This is an inevitable death, inevitable death
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon
Look into the picture
Look into the picture
Look into the picture
Look into the picture
This is what I lived to be
This very moment is the first time in my life that I've felt pure joy
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon
Slide into the water
Become one with the sea
Life seems so much smaller
Swim to the moon
