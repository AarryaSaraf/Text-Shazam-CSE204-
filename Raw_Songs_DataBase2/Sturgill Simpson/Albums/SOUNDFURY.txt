// Remember To Breathe //

I go out late at night just to see what I can find
Stayin' in the shadows where the light don't ever shine
Having one-way conversations with the darkness in my mind
He does all the talking 'cause I'm the quiet kind

So peel it off, pull 'em down
Let me see it, turn around
Just lay back and let it happen
And remember to breathe

Staying off the radar like a bomber on the run
Do another lap around the target just for fun
Stayin' quiet, keeping calm until I find the one
Feel the wave wash over me when the deed is done

So peel it off, pull 'em down
Let me see it, turn around
Just lay back and let it happen
And remember to breathe

Well, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back
Oh, just lay back

Oh, just lay back, oh, just lay back
And remember to breathe
Well, just lay back now and let it happen
And remember to breathe

// Sing Along //

Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like razor thorn
Bitter air and winds of spite
Like the cold of winters scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was in now decay

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone

A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancing in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one
Compromise is made out of peace
But history is made out of violence
After the war of words has ceased
All that's left is the deafening silence

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong so here's your song
Now sing along baby

I know you know that you're killing me
But its worth it just to see you smile
Tell em' to carve my name in the barstool baby
You know I'm gonna be here a while

A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancing in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong so here's your song
Now sing along

// A Good Look //

The Star of David don't belong to David at all
He borrowed it from Peter just so he could pay off Paul
Peter copyrighted the Star and now he owns the claim
But a star is still a star by any other name

Well, now everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skippin' straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book

I write my poems in the dirt with an oily rag
I have to wear a gas mask just so I don't gag
I got a SOCOM Scout and 20 extra mags
And a couple severed heads in my bug-out bag

Well, everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skipping straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book

Why you gettin' pissed 'cause you're gettin' discovered?
Are you talking all this shit just to get on the cover?
Well then, how're you gonna eat when you're bitin' the hand?
Well, you know they don't like it when you take a stand
So enjoy it while you can
And say hi to all the boys in the band
'Cause it's all over now
Just a flash in the pan

Well, now everybody's worried 'bout a good look
But they need to be worried 'bout a good hook
Instead of skipping straight to the last page
In that ol' rationalization book

// Make Art Not Friends //

Looking out the window at a world on fire
It's plain to see the end is near
Seen all the sights
Tired of the lights
So you could let me off right here

This town is getting crowded
Truth's been shrouded
I think it's time to change up the sound
Yeah, the wheels keep turning
The flames gettin' higher
Another cycle goes around

Face in the mirror, all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends

I love saying no to all the yes-men
Just to see the look on their face
Love how everybody knows what's best
But nobody knows their place

Sucker ever second, stack 'em up to the sky
For every winner there's a hundred that died
So you get yours and stay outta mine
Here's to the memories, where do I sign?

Face in the mirror, all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends

Oh, it's getting hard to find a good friend
So close the door behind you
Before anymore come in
Nobody writes, nobody calls
Nobody bother 'cause I'm over it all

Face in the mirror, all skin and bones
Bloodshot eyes and a heart of stone
Never again, rather be alone
Think I'm gonna just stay home
And make art, not friends

// Best Clockmaker On Mars //

Wanna grow old in the mountain view
Wanna make babies 'til you say you're through
Warm, bare, and naked when you pull me through
Turn off the TV, there ain't nothin' new

Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars

Some days, I hate everything I am
But your love holds a mirror to me
Show me a love I can understand
Make sense of the world I see

Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars

Wanna grow old in the mountain view
Wanna make babies 'til you say you're through
Warm, bare, and naked when you pull me through
Turn off the TV, there ain't nothin' new

Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars
Gonna wake up every day and be the best clockmaker on Mars

// All Said And Done //

Spent the last year going out of my mind
Looking for reasons I could never find
Until I put my finger on it and saw every sign
Take all you can get, keep your fingers off of mine

Sitting in the tower without a clue or care
And goodbye opportunities hanging off of my head
Handing several items out to anyone who dares
Climb my own way up to the top just to get kicked down the stairs

Bein' pulled a million ways all at the same time
It's enough to make anyone go insane
When you find yourself forgetting all your own rhymes
Givin' up on dreams floating 'round inside your brain

Bein' pulled a million ways all at the same time
It's enough to make anyone go insane
When you find yourself forgetting all your own rhymes
Givin' up on the dreams floating 'round inside your brain

Keep staring at the pages, going over the same lines
It's all been said and done by now, two or three times

// Last Man Standing //

I'm always double-dippin', gulpin' while they're sippin'
Got shit to do no time to lose
Gotta sell out just to buy in, shit the bed you're gonna die in
And the destiny is yours to lose
Be the part of the solution, don't be part of the problem
Gotta know you're alone, climb on their shoulders and rob 'em

Time to turn on the heat, it's gettin' cold on the street
And man this shit'll get you down
It's fuck-all-of-y'all season, don't give me a reason
To watch your house burn to the ground
And light my new joint off the flames
I never learned how to play, so I broke the game
Now, I'm flipping the board with the ink and the sword
Walkin' 'round crossin' off names

I'm gonna ride off into the sunset
While it all burns to hell behind me
Somewhere I haven't been yet
Somewhere they can't even see
Well, you know daddy likes his alone time
It's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but want you to see, you'll be looking at me
The last man standing in the end

Folks gettin' sticky, got no time for gettin' picky
'Bout the who, what, the when, or the where
You selling tugs on a pickle with a back door tickle
'Fore you even know how you got there
Well, I'm not gonna say what you want me to say
Plenty people pandering already anyway
Don't even try because I already did it
Bullshit sells, don't you ever forget it
Going full speed is the greatest escape
Slamming on the gas, I can't find the brake
I don't know how much more I can take
Well, I'm gonna keep going 'til I find out

Well, mama didn't raise nobody's dumb dog
No time to win a medal for being the most ...
Well, I know daddy needs his alone time
That's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but I want you to see, you'll be looking at me
The last man standing in the end
(Hey)

// Mercury In Retrograde //

I got a haircut in Norway
When all the weight started pulling me down
Smelling like a waterlogged wet dog
Ain't no way to travel
But as soon as I chopped it all off
It just grew back, thick and brown
I keep tugging on the thread
Hoping it all might come unraveled
I keep trying to throw it all away
But it comes right back around

They come backstage and on my bus
Pretending to be my friend
Shaking hands behind grandstands
All wearing the same old grin
Oh, but none of them bother knocking
Oh, they all just come on in
Asking me what all my songs mean
Wonderin' if they're all about them

Mercury must be in retrograde again
But at least it's not just hangin' around pretendin' to be my friend
Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention
If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention

Living the dream makes a man wanna scream
Light a match and burn it all down
Head back home to the mountain
Far away from the pull
Of all the journalists and sycophants wielding their brands
And all the traveling trophies and award show stands
And all the haters wishing they was in my band
Sorry boys, the bus is plumb full

Mercury must be in retrograde again
But at least it's not just hangin' around pretendin' to be my friend
Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention
If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention

And there's nothing for me outside this hotel room
But another letdown, lonely day
Tour is almost over, and I'll be home soon
And it's all been done two or three times anyway

Mercury must be in retrograde again
But at least it's not just hangin' around pretendin' to be my friend
Oh, the road to Hell is paved with cruel intention
If it's not nuclear war, it's gonna be a divine intervention

// Fastest Horse In Town //

I been wasting all my best days
I invested all my worst ways
I've been thinking about all the things
I should have never left behind
Oughta be watching the children playing
In the yard I never see I should be mowing today
Instead, I'm searching for ways to say
All the words I can't find

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
But look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Back when dollars made sense
Had to keep the squirrels off the fence
And shoes are coming loose on the fastest horse in town
But that old horse just keeps on running
If he falls, they'll put him down
Them men keeping him out on the track
Running him ragged just to pile up the stacks
Make it so he's all spent by the time he gets back

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

(Well, you know what I want?
We need, we need a gift card for
Are y'all listening to me? This is what I want
I want a gift card from God
He can keep it all
I want a gift card from God)
