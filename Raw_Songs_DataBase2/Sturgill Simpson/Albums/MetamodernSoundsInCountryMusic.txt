// Turtles All The Way Down //

I've seen Jesus play with flames in a lake of fire that I was standing in
Met the devil in Seattle and spent 9 months inside the lions den
Met Buddha yet another time and he showed me a glowing light within
But I swear that God is there every time I glare in the eyes of my best friend
Says my son it's all been done and someday you're gonna wake up old and gray
So go and try to have some fun showing warmth to everyone
You meet and greet and cheat along the way

There's a gateway in our mind that leads somewhere out there far beyond this plane
Where reptile aliens made of light cut you open and pull out all your pain
Tell me how you make illegal something that we all make in our brain
Some say you might go crazy but then again it might make you go sane

Every time I take a look inside that old and fabled book
I'm blinded and reminded of the pain caused by some old man in the sky
Marijuana, LSD, psilocybin, and DMT they all changed the way I see
But love's the only thing that ever saved my life

So don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes
Or fairy tales of blood and wine
It's turtles all the way down the line
So to each their own til' we go home
To other realms our souls must roam
To and through the myth that we all call space and time

// Life Of Sin //

Lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Sex is cheap and talk is overrated
And the boys and me still working on the sound

A little happiness, a little love was all I wanted
Sure as Hell thought I'd found it but I was wrong
She left my heart feeling taunted and my memories all haunted
But it's her I have to thank for all my songs

So every day I'm smoking my brain hazy
All I can do to keep from going crazy
But the paranoia is slowly creeping in
I keep drinking myself silly
Only way for this hillbilly
And I thank God for this here life of sin

Every morning when I rise I look in the mirror and despise
the sight of everything and all that I've become
The level of my medicating some might find intimidating
But that's alright cause' it don't bother me none

// Living The Dream //

Time and time again Lord I've been going through the motion
It's a means to an end but the ends don't seem to meet
Walking around living the dream anytime I take the notion
Til the truth comes bubbling up so bittersweet

Ain't no point getting outta bed when you ain't living the dream
Like making a big old pot of coffee when you ain't got no cream
I don't need to change my strings
Cause the dirt don't hurt the way I sing
I don't have to do a Goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die

Well I've been waiting on an angel waitress to come and take my order
Tell me all about the special today
Staring at a puddle of mud in my spoon couldn't be much bolder
Hoping them circles on the paper don't call back telling me to start today

That old man upstairs, He wears a crooked smile
Staring down on the chaos he created
He said son if you ain't having fun just wait a little while
Momma's gonna wash it all away
And she thinks mercy's overrated

// Voices //

There's a voice that I can hear sometimes out here on the mountain
When it's dark and the sky is pouring acid like a fountain
Memories like coal dust stain the window of my eyes
So ask them no more questions they can't sell you no more lies

I hear voices all around me in society's depression
Over and over they all recite their first impression
The rivers are all crying but the ocean cannot speak
Until her waters crash into uncharted shores so dark and bleak

How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they don't have much to say
Well a picture's worth a 1000 words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time

Don't call it a sign of the times when it's always been this way
Voices behind curtains forked tongues that have no name
They plot their wicked schemes setting fate for all mankind
With evil that can fill God's pretty skies with clouds that burn and blind

How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they don't have much to say
Well a picture's worth a 1000 words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time

// Long White Line //

I won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
I woke up my baby was gone without her I don't need no home
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line

Went to the bank to get my dough I don't care where I go
Gonna' push this rig 'til I push that girl out of my mind
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

New York City, Old St. Joe, Albuquerque New Mexico
This old rig is humming and rolling, she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

New York City, Old St. Joe, Albuquerque New Mexico
This old rig is humming and rolling, she's doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

I won't be around this old town anymore for a long long time
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line

// The Promise //

If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end, I'll always be there
But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around, and I'll be there

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise, I promise you I will

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there
Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no gripe to bear

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be
But if I had to walk the world to make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

// A Little Light Within //

Through all these Earthly trials of sorrow
Through all these days of mortal sin
Through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
Gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within

Gotta walk that road all the way to Heaven
Gotta walk that road until the dawn
Gotta walk that road all night
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get the brighter it turns on

Don't need no compass no map or chart
Don't need no stars shining above
Don't need nothing but a little light in my heart
Glowing inside me like a blanket of love

// Just Let Go //

Woke up today and decided to kill my ego
It aint ever done me no good no how
Gonna break through and blast off to the Bardo
In them flowers of light far away from the here and now

Taking a 49 divine day vacation
From reality and all else in between
Gonna transmigrate to my destination
Far beyond time in an eternal dream

But am I dreaming or am I dying
Either way I don't mind at all
It feels so good you just can't help but crying
You have to let go so the soul can fall

Oh my God it's so beautiful
Everything is a part of me
It's so hard looking through all the lies made of wool
But if you close your eyes it becomes so easy to see

// It Ain't All Flowers //

Cleaning out the darkest corner of my mind
Taking all my full circles, and making straight lines
Been getting to the bottom of the bottom getting to me
Been holding up the mirror to everything I don't want to see
But it ain't all flowers, sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns

Been dancing with demons all my life
Every time I find my groove they cut in like a knife
Been a sin eater oh since the day I was born
Tired of feeling weighed down from carrying round all the pain that keeps me torn
So I pray when I lay me down to die
Grab a glass of wine and a seat to dine and go ahead and eat the whole damn pie

But it ain't all flowers, sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns
