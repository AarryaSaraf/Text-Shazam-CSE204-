// A Little Light //

Through all these Earthly trials of sorrow
Through all these days of doubt and sin
Through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
Gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within

Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road)
All the way to Heaven (All the way to Heaven)
Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road), until the dawn
Gotta walk that road all night
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on

Don't need no compass no map or chart
I don't need no stars shining above
I don't need nothing but a little light in my heart
Glowing inside me like a blanket of love

Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road)
All the way to Heaven (All the way to Heaven)
Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road), until the dawn
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on
I said the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on

// All The Pretty Colors //

Grey is the color of my world since you left me
On that bright and sunny, orange and mournful day
No more rainbows shining out my window
Like you my skies of blue have gone away

I guess you bought and sold all the silver and the gold
This old world don't seem to shine no more
Yellow, purple, pink, and red have been replaced by lead
Like the foggy hollow that I'm headed for

And all the colors are bleeding
Where's ol' Van Gogh when you need him
I bet you my left ear he can relate
And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey

Well, some say grey's a better way to live than blue
Not quite black and white but in between
But I've been so down ever since those eyes of brown
Followed white lines back to pines eternal green

And all the colors are bleeding
Where's ol' Van Gogh when you need him
I bet you my left ear he can relate
And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey

And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey

// Hobo Cartoon //

Wish I was riding a steam train
Right out of the pages of time
Down through the old roaring 20s
For the fall of 1929
Back in the heyday of railroads
Before airplanes fluttered and flew
Color me in like a cartoon hobo
Doing what bums used to do

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon

Show me hopping a freight train
Somewhere south of the yard
Make it a Santa Fe boxcar
Paint all rusty and hard
Sketch out an old hobo jungle
Make the old days come alive on the page
Build a rough shack, down by the track
Weather it heavy with age

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon

Sometimes things are great to remember
Some are too good to forget
Things back then were so different
Some things, we think of them yet

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon

// I Don't Mind //

There's a lonely feeling that I carry
That will follow me all my days
I walked out on the heart you were nursing
Turned my back on a love you saved

Well, just when my clouds were drifting
My plan got rearranged
But there ain't no going back now
And ain't no way that I can change

I believe that I found God
About the same time that I found you
All that stuff about heaven and angels
Well, I know now that it's all true

But you drift in and out of my dreams now
Like a ship out at sea in a storm
And when I wake up every morning
I roll over and find you still gone
Gone

I'm alone in a way that I've never been
Since you left me behind
If you think you can ever love me again
Please go ahead, I don't mind
Oh, no

It feels like you're so far away now
And I'm stuck out here all by myself
All the things I wish I had told you
Still inside my mind bottled and shelved

In my dreams although I can hear you
There's a darkness that hides you from sight
So I search all around trying to feel you
All I find is a world without light

There's a world I want to leave
And a world where I want to stay
There's a dream that I believe
When I wake up it goes away

I'm alone in a way that I've never been
Since you left me behind
If you think you can ever love me again
Please go ahead, I don't mind

// I Wonder //

Loneliness is setting in
How I feel you don't know
All my tomorrows, they depend
On how my todays go
Ain't seen your face for a few years or more
You don't write, you don't call
Tell me what are all the memories for
When you don't remember at all?

I'm sad and lonely
I wonder do you feel the same
Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?

Maybe someday you'll walk into
Some bar I'm singing in
You'll hang your head in sorrow and cry
When you see the shape that I'm in

Oh, I'm sad and lonely
I wonder do you feel the same
Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?

Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?

// Jesus Boogie //

My days are filled with moments of doubt of shame
Seems everybody's in line to let me down
I look all around me there's no one left to blame
What have I done to deserve my thorny crown?

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God

Father, why have you forsaken me?
My silver is dross, my water is mixed with wine
My eyes are full of blood I cannot see
Well the sins I now pay for, they are not mine

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God

I always knew it would end this way
Still it is you to whom Father I now pray
Somehow I knew I'd end up here on my own
All alone, all alone, Father without you

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God

// Paradise //

When I was a child my family would travel
In Western Kentucky where my parents were born
There's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg county
Down by the Green River where paradise lay?
I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelt like snakes, we'd shoot with our pistols
Empty pop bottles was all we would kill

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg county
Down by the Green River where paradise lay?
I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber, stripped all the land
Well they dug for their coal 'til the land was forsaken
And we wrote it all down as the progress of man

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg county
Down by the Green River where paradise lay?
I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
'N I'll be half way to heaven, with Paradise waiting
Just five miles away from wherever I am

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg county
Down by the Green River where paradise lay?
I'm sorry my son but you're too late in asking
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Mr Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

// Sometimes Wine //

I have always tried to keep my glass full
Sometimes I have whiskey and sometimes wine
Baby, why is it whenever your glass is empty
You come along and knock over mine?

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before

I couldn't tell you how much I paid for this bottle
And how long we've been here your guess is as good as mine
Sometimes that wine don't hit me like it ought to
But that old whiskey suits me fine

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before

Drove me to drinking, ran off with some other man
But a broken heart heals like a bottle empties with time
Well, since you've been gone life's been more than I can stand
So sometimes whiskey and sometimes there's wine

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before
But then I've never been without you before

// Tennessee //

I been going out of my mind for a while now
Tryna find my way back home, I don't know how
Oh I'm all the way up here, in Kentucky seeing things clear
Through a haze of whiskey tears and misery
While you're all the way down there in Tennessee

I been going at it a little hard as of late it might seem
Been waking up every day in the same bad dream
Taking long walks at night, seeing things in a much bluer light
That old moon and your memory following me
'Cause you're all the way down there in Tennessee

They say in Tennessee, the sun is always shining
But this blue moon glowing on me has got me pining

I been trying to find my way back with no luck so far
And the hardest part is just knowing how close you are
Two hundred and ten mile drive, three hours down South Sixty-Five
But it feels like there's an ocean between you and me
'Cause you're all the way down there in Tennessee

// The Dead Don't Die //

Oh the dead don't die anymore than you or I
They're just ghosts inside a dream
Of a life that we don't own
They walk around us all the time
Never payin' any mind to the silly lives we lead
Or the reapin' we've all sown

There's a cup of coffee waiting on every corner
Someday we're gonna wake up and find the corners gone

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on

There'll be old friends walking around in a somewhat familiar town
That you saw once when you looked up from your phone
Nobody bothers to saying hi, you can save all your goodbyes
Stop trying to pretend that we're all not at home

And the streets will look so empty in the morning
There'll be no one out at night for the lights to shine down on

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on

Hearts break when loved ones journey on
At the thought that they're now forever gone
So we tell ourselves they're all still around us all the time
Gone but not forgotten, just memories left behind

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on
After life is over, the afterlife goes on

// When It Comes To You //

If we can't get along
We ought to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
Set me free, sign my release
I'm tired of being a villain of the peace

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you
Saying them things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?

You only get one life, and this I know
I want to get my licks in now before I go
Fire of love is dead and cold
I got to satisfy the hunger in my soul

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
Saying the things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?

If we can't get along
We ought to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
Set me free, sign my release
I'm tired of being a villain of the peace

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
