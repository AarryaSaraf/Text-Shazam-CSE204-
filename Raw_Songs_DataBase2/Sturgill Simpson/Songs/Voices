There's a voice that I can hear sometimes out here on the mountain
When it's dark and the sky is pouring acid like a fountain
Memories like coal dust stain the window of my eyes
So ask them no more questions they can't sell you no more lies

I hear voices all around me in society's depression
Over and over they all recite their first impression
The rivers are all crying but the ocean cannot speak
Until her waters crash into uncharted shores so dark and bleak

How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they don't have much to say
Well a picture's worth a 1000 words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time

Don't call it a sign of the times when it's always been this way
Voices behind curtains forked tongues that have no name
They plot their wicked schemes setting fate for all mankind
With evil that can fill God's pretty skies with clouds that burn and blind

How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but they don't have much to say
Well a picture's worth a 1000 words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking til the end of time
