My days are filled with moments of doubt of shame
Seems everybody's in line to let me down
I look all around me there's no one left to blame
What have I done to deserve my thorny crown?

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God

Father, why have you forsaken me?
My silver is dross, my water is mixed with wine
My eyes are full of blood I cannot see
Well the sins I now pay for, they are not mine

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God

I always knew it would end this way
Still it is you to whom Father I now pray
Somehow I knew I'd end up here on my own
All alone, all alone, Father without you

You never asked me if I wanted to be
The Son of God
