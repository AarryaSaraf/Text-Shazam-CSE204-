Wish I was riding a steam train
Right out of the pages of time
Down through the old roaring 20s
For the fall of 1929
Back in the heyday of railroads
Before airplanes fluttered and flew
Color me in like a cartoon hobo
Doing what bums used to do

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon

Show me hopping a freight train
Somewhere south of the yard
Make it a Santa Fe boxcar
Paint all rusty and hard
Sketch out an old hobo jungle
Make the old days come alive on the page
Build a rough shack, down by the track
Weather it heavy with age

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon

Sometimes things are great to remember
Some are too good to forget
Things back then were so different
Some things, we think of them yet

Songs from the great Jimmie Rodgers
Hearing old Bing Crosby croon
This is a song of how things used to be
And a script of a hobo cartoon
