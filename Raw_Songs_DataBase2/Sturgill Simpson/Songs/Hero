Decided to write a song for my hero
Considering he's done so much for me
He's the one that pulled me up when I fell down so low
He's the one that led me through the darkness when I could not see
Never met a man more gentle or any humbler
Never once heard him raise his voice or saw him mad
But I watched him break his back on coal and lumber
To give her everything she never had

Cause when it all comes down to zero
There's nothing more this life could ever give
And I know I'll never find another hero
Not another one like him

Born on a summer day in some dark holler
Way back in the hills of Perry County
Well he grew up poor and he never saw a dollar
But a dollar ain't no good in a coal camp anyway

Cause when it all comes down to zero
There's nothing more this life could ever give
And I know I'll never find another hero
Not another one like him

And if I'm half the man he is when I die
I don't know if I could ask for too much more
He taught me you only need one hand
to count your real friends in this life
But if you find true love you better take both arms
and hold on til your sore
