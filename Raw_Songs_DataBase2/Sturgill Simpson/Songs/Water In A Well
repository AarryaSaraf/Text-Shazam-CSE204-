They say that looks can be deceiving
and there's been rumors going round
One look at me's the same thing as believing
everything you've heard without hearing a sound
So if my eyes remind you of water in a well
It's because your heart is the stone
I know sometimes it can seem like my mind
belongs to a child that's grown
But somewhere between you and me I've lost my way
and I've been trying to get home
Trying like hell but it's too soon to tell
If our love has all dried up like water in a well

Lord knows I've tried to move on
and get you out of my mind
You find your way in to all of my songs
Every memory I manage to find
Someday if I'm standing on some big old stage
And you're down in the crowd
Trying to tell your friends I used to know him when
But in your heart you'll know it ain't true somehow
Trying like hell but it's too soon to tell
If our love has all dried up like water in a well

I know you see what it's doing to me
I'm up here playing my part in this nobody town
