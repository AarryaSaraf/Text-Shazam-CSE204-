I'm always double-dippin', gulpin' while they're sippin'
Got shit to do no time to lose
Gotta sell out just to buy in, shit the bed you're gonna die in
And the destiny is yours to lose
Be the part of the solution, don't be part of the problem
Gotta know you're alone, climb on their shoulders and rob 'em

Time to turn on the heat, it's gettin' cold on the street
And man this shit'll get you down
It's fuck-all-of-y'all season, don't give me a reason
To watch your house burn to the ground
And light my new joint off the flames
I never learned how to play, so I broke the game
Now, I'm flipping the board with the ink and the sword
Walkin' 'round crossin' off names

I'm gonna ride off into the sunset
While it all burns to hell behind me
Somewhere I haven't been yet
Somewhere they can't even see
Well, you know daddy likes his alone time
It's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but want you to see, you'll be looking at me
The last man standing in the end

Folks gettin' sticky, got no time for gettin' picky
'Bout the who, what, the when, or the where
You selling tugs on a pickle with a back door tickle
'Fore you even know how you got there
Well, I'm not gonna say what you want me to say
Plenty people pandering already anyway
Don't even try because I already did it
Bullshit sells, don't you ever forget it
Going full speed is the greatest escape
Slamming on the gas, I can't find the brake
I don't know how much more I can take
Well, I'm gonna keep going 'til I find out

Well, mama didn't raise nobody's dumb dog
No time to win a medal for being the most ...
Well, I know daddy needs his alone time
That's why he doesn't have any friends
Yeah, but I want you to see, you'll be looking at me
The last man standing in the end
(Hey)
