Oh the dead don't die anymore than you or I
They're just ghosts inside a dream
Of a life that we don't own
They walk around us all the time
Never payin' any mind to the silly lives we lead
Or the reapin' we've all sown

There's a cup of coffee waiting on every corner
Someday we're gonna wake up and find the corners gone

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on

There'll be old friends walking around in a somewhat familiar town
That you saw once when you looked up from your phone
Nobody bothers to saying hi, you can save all your goodbyes
Stop trying to pretend that we're all not at home

And the streets will look so empty in the morning
There'll be no one out at night for the lights to shine down on

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on

Hearts break when loved ones journey on
At the thought that they're now forever gone
So we tell ourselves they're all still around us all the time
Gone but not forgotten, just memories left behind

But the dead will still be walking around in this old world alone
After life is over, the afterlife goes on
After life is over, the afterlife goes on
