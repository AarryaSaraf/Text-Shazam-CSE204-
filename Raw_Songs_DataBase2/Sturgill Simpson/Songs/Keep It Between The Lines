Don't turn mailboxes into baseballs
Don't get busted selling at seventeen
Most thoughts deserve about two or three more
Motoroil is motoroil
Just keep your engine clean
Keep your eyes on the prize
Everything will be fine
Long as you stay in school
Stay off the hard stuff
And keep between the lines

Don't burn two lanterns at the same time
No ship out on the water will pay your rent
Cause you live and you learn
Sometimes you get burned
When your get out done got up
Walked out the door and went
Do as I say
Don't do as I've done
It don't have to be
Like a father, like his son

Don't let them try to upsell you
There's a reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
If there's any doubt, there is no doubt
The gut don't never lie
And the only word you'll ever need to know in life is "why"
Keep your head out of the clouds
And remember to be kind
And just stay in school
Stay off the drugs
And keep between the lines

(Don't, don't sweat the small stuff)
(Can't sweat the small stuff)
(Don't sweat the small stuff)
