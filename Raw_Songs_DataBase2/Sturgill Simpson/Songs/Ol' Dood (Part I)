One and all have heard the stories and eyewitness had been sworn
About a man born in Hard Burly back in June of '29
Must've got that Martin Meylin muzzle the day he was born
Things he could do with that rifle
Blow the balls off a bat, reload and shoot it one more time

Had an monster of a mule, was a mighty fine steed
Sham, and Sam, that tomahawk, and that Flintlocks all he need
Finding food and finding trouble and always takin' heed
And any man that crossed him was surely gonna bleed
And he'd stretch you up and burn you for callin' him half breed

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't wanna end up in his debt 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden

Wore a size 17 ring, had hands like a bear
And if he got 'em on ya, he's takin' that top hair
His Grandfather taught him how to hunt and how to live off the land
Taught him how to take a scalp when you kill a man

He was a deadly warrin' daddy with a gun gleam in his eye
Till he found him a good woman that calmed down the rage
He built a home from the land with the hands good Lord gave him
And ol' Dood got his own food
Had no need for the scrip that ol' coal company paid

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him, they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
