Through all these Earthly trials of sorrow
Through all these days of doubt and sin
Through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
Gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within

Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road)
All the way to Heaven (All the way to Heaven)
Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road), until the dawn
Gotta walk that road all night
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on

Don't need no compass no map or chart
I don't need no stars shining above
I don't need nothing but a little light in my heart
Glowing inside me like a blanket of love

Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road)
All the way to Heaven (All the way to Heaven)
Gotta walk that road (Gotta walk that road), until the dawn
All you need is a little light
And the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on
I said the closer you get, Lord, the brighter it turns on
