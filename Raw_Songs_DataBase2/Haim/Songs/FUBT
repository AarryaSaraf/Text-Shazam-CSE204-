I kinda like it when you leave me at the party late
'Cause every now and then I wanna feel an empty space
I kinda like it when you say the things you shouldn't say
'Cause those are all the things that I was thinkin' anyway

It's wrong
That you could do no wrong
And, baby, even though
It makes me miserable

It's fucked up but it's true
That I love you like I do
But I'm just gonna keep on lovin' you
It's tough to get through
Either way, I'm gonna lose
So, I'm just gonna keep on loving you

I spend my mornings overthinkin' all my own mistakes
But I would never judge your problems in the same way
You beat yourself up and I let you take it out on me
Another day, another hour, no apology

How can I sleep when I can't dream at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need
How can I dream when I can't sleep at night?
All of my needs I say I don't need

And it's fucked up but it's true
That I love you like I do
But I'm just gonna keep on lovin' you
It's tough to get through
Either way I'm gonna lose
So, I'm just gonna keep on loving you

It's fucked up but it's true
Gonna keep on lovin' you
Till the days are through
