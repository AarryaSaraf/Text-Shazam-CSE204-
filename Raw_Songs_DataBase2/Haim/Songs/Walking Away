You don't wanna talk, don't wanna work it out
If you were gonna face it, you would've by now
When were you around, when were you a-
I waited hours and hours, hearing loud sirens
Suffered through lies differently
You see, now I'm not coming around
Coming around, coming around

I'm walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away

You don't wanna give and you don't wanna know how
If you were gonna change things, you wouldn't been there
What were you around, when were you are
Trying not think about it, baby
Running up and down the stairs
'Til there's nothing left between us but what we won't say

Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away

I don't know what's said so many times before
But now it's keeping me away
I know you did it so many times before
But I never thought I'd be the one you betrayed
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us

Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you
Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you
Say something, say something, say something
While I can still hear you, while I can still hear you

Away, I'm not gonna wait
Nothing you could say that'll make me rethink
Every chance that we had and messed up
All the times it got away from us
