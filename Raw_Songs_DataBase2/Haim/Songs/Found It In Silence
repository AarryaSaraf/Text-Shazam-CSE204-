I wanted an honest man
I thought I found one of them
Stood by him every time I was scared
I was blind, wasn't I
Thought he was an honest man
Who could put me back together again
Tried so hard to read his mind, through his eyes
I was scared, I was blind

But I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

Three fingers on the edge
You always talk me down in the end
Made me think you were right, all this time
Not this time, not this time
Both of us, holding back
But you were the most guilty of that
Someone else on your mouth, all this time
I was right, wasn't I

You told me, "don't walk away"
You told me not to walk away
You told me not to walk, walk, walk...

But I found it in silence, I finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
I found it in silence, I finally see (I finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (found it in silence), finally see (finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
Found it in silence (found it in silence), finally see (finally see)
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me

It was always for the better
And I guess I should have known
The truth is, it's your issue, I know I need to let it go
And though I have found happiness, in my life that's truly mine
You'd think I could just laugh it off, but it gets me every time

But I found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Found it in, found it in silence
Finally see
Found it in silence, finally
Found it in silence, finally see
Found it in silence, finally

I found it in silence, I finally see
There's no turning back, I know what's good for me
