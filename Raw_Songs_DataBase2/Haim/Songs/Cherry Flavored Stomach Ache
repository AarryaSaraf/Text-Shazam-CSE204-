Tried to withdraw a guilt plea
(Damn) You ain't gonna pin this one on me
One thing's for sure, I'm not sleeping here tonight
And I'm not interested in what you think is right

She gets so lonely, she can't relate to anyone
She turns on the television and slips into a dream
She woke up in a scream
Take it easy on her

I'm not gonna see you anymore
'Cause you're not strong enough
And you're not smart enough
And you're not cool enough

Looking out the window of the cafe
There's a boy with cherry coloured lips
More like cherry flavored stomach ache

She gets so lonely, she can't relate to anyone
She picks up her phone to check the latest gossip
If you're up or you're down it's just a toss up

I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore
I'm not gonna see you anymore
