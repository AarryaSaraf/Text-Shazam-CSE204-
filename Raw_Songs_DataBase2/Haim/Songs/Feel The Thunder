Hah, come on
(Woh-oh)

Can you hear?
The sisters of thunder round here
Crash, poom-pow
It's coming right through the clouds
I got a need for speed
I'm gonna bring you down to your knees
It's big, it's loud
Yeah, we're on the prowl

Feel it shaking to your core
Feel it quaking but you want more

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder (feel the thunder) feel the noise (feel the noise)
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy

(Come on, sisters)

Can you see?
Our power's shaking the trees
Bam, boom-bang
You know we can't be tamed
We can't slow down
We're taking you to thunder town
On vines we swing
We're getting you in the ring

Feel it rumble (here we go) to your core
You took a tumble but you want more

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder (feel the thunder) feel the noise (feel the noise)
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy

You want more? uh-huh

Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
Feel the thunder, feel the noise
Feel the thunder (uh-huh) 'cause we're in the mood to destroy
