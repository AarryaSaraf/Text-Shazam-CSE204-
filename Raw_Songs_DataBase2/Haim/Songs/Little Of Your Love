Give me just a little of your love

You're just another recovering heart
I wasn't even gonna try
You wouldn't even give up time
Could be so easy, you make it hard
Don't think about love too much
My love is gonna be enough

You're so close now
And I know now

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Don't it feel like that night was from a dream
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've never felt nothing like that
Looking at you, looking right back
You say nothing is ever as good as it seems
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Stop running your mouth like that
'Cause you know I'm gonna give it right back

You're so close now
(Don't let me down) (Don't let me down)
So don't let me down

You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
And I'll try
You gotta give me just a little of you love, give me just a little of your love

Oh with a little strength baby
Oh, I'll never let you down
With a little love, a little love, a little love, a little love
Give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
You gotta give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love

Give me just a little of your love (ha)
Give me just a little of your love (come on)
Give me just a little of your love (baby)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)
You gotta give me just a little of your love, baby
Give me just a little of your love (just a little of your love)

Give me just a little of your love (ha, ha)
Give me just a little of your love (ha, come on)
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love, just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
Give me just a little of your love
