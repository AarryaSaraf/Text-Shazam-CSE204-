Go slow
So that I can hear everything you're saying.
Now I know you're going.
You just threw this away.
You know I ain't gonna take it.

Go slow.
Make me you're gonna make it.
I know.
I can't make you stay.
But I'll be hurting from the heat.
Hurtin' from the heat.

Well, well, was it something that I said?
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
Going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From the heat now.
Oh I just wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.
From your heat it's coming, coming.

I know.
I'm giving in and believing every lie.
For now, the moon, it's night.
I turn off the light.
But you shook up the foundation.
Go slow.
Now.
With your intimidation.
I know.
You turn away now I'll be hurting from the heat.
Heat.
Hurtin' from the heat.

Well, well, was it something that I said.
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
I'm going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From your heat now.
Oh I wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.
From your heat it's coming, coming.

From the heat now.
From the heat now, now, now, now.

Well, well, was it something that I said.
I know that it was something I said.
From your heat now.
Well, I'm going crazy trying hard to forget.
You know I'm trying to hard forget.
From your heat now.
Oh I wanna go back hold on to the way that I was
'Cause you took away all my young life.
And I hate who I've become from your heat now.

Go back...
Go back...

From your heat now.
I just wanna go back. Go back. Go back.

Go back...
Go back...
