I've been running around town
Feeling up and down
Taped up the windows at the house
But I ain't dead yet

Would you even pick me out in a crowd?
'Cause I can't recognize myself now
And I'm turning away help
Can you pull me out?

I've been down
I've been down

You say there's no stupid questions
Only stupid people
Well, I've been feelin' pretty foolish
Trying to get myself through this
And I've been watching too much TV
Looking up at the ceiling
It's been making me feel creepy
I'm just trying to shake this feeling

I've been down
I've been down
I've been down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
Can you help me out?
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)

I'm waking up at night
Tick-tock, killing time
A little moonlight coming through the blinds
The love of my life sleeping by my side
But I'm still down

Well, I think that we need to come together
I think that we need to come together
(You know I'm down)
I think that we need to come together
I think that we need to come together
(You know I'm down)

I've been down
I've been down
I've been down
Can you help me out?

I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)
I feel down
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby)
Can you help me out?
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, honey)
