Counting the hours
With nothing to say
Going though the motions
It's slipping away
We were so gallant
So unafraid
Sleeping back to back
You're turning away

How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
It was good, but now it's gone (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong

Sound of the times
Sound of your crimes
Thinking about the other night
Was it all in my mind?
I was so foolish, I was so blind
Why do we do this to each other, baby
Heartbreak by design

How could you tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(Could you tell me nothing's wrong?)
It was good, but now it's gone
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong
(T-tell me nothing's wrong)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)

It's obvious
Be honest
It's obvious (Could you tell me nothing's wrong)
Be honest
It's obvious
Be honest
It's obvious (Just tell me baby)
Be honest
It's obvious
Be honest
Be honest, be honest

Tell me nothing's wrong
T-tell me nothing's wrong
T-tell me nothing's wrong
Yeah, yeah

How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along (T-tell me)
Just tell me nothing's wrong
(Just tell me baby)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Tell me, tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
How could you tell me nothing's wrong (T-tell me)
Go on, tell me what you want (T-tell me)
Boy, you're telling me all along
