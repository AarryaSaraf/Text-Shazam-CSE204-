We met in the springtime

When blossoms unfold

The pastures were green and

Meadows were gold


Our love was in flower as summer grew on

A love like the leaves has withered and gone

The roses have faded

There's frost at my door

The birds in the morning don't sing anymore


The grass in the valley has started to die

Out in the darkness the whippets will cry


Alone and forsaken

Oh lord if you hear me then hold to my hand

Oh please understand


Where has she gone to, oh where can she be

She may have forsaken some other like me

She promised to honor, to love and obey

Each vow was a plaything that she threw away


The darkness is falling

The sky has turned gray

A hound in the distance is starting to bay


I wonder, I wonder what she's thinking of

Forsaken, forgotten without any love


Alone and forsaken

By Fate and by man

Oh lord if you hear me then hold to my hand

Oh please understand

Oh please understand
