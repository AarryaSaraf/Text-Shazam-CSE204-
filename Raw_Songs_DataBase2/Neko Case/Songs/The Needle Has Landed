Here I am in traffic's slow flow

Where the needle touched down

Carbon planes draw a cage round the air force base

Where the needle touched down

My foot on the brake it's ok to fly low

Over poor Spanaway


An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer

Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter

The needle's the same that recorded and played

When you left me at the greyhound the year I moved away

And if I knew then what's so obvious now

You'd still be here baby

My baby, baby


So that's why I never come back here

That's why they spit out my name

Your ex's have clawed up the bible

Trying to keep me away

With the sledge of tectonic fever

The needle has landed again

Let it play


And the needle touched down

The needle is landing

And the needle touched down

The needle is landing


An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer

Took the name of your town

From a sharp-toothed freighter

And if I knew then what's so obvious now

You'd still be here
