A childless widow of a nation
You cry like guns across the water
Yet we expect you to bring springtime, it isn't fair
Searchlights wither in your hair

You are a silent movie, Sarah

Men build their industries around you
Gathered in withers of your hair
They're looking farther on reflection
You're left to die of exposure, Sarah
Sarah with the beating heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
Sarah with the..
You are a silent movie, Sarah

Let her go, the light is fading
I cry like guns across the water
She didn't ask to be your remake or your muse
The parasites inside of booze

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is no one home

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is only echo

From a recording machine
Screaming  my dreams
You see our poets (poets)
Do an odious business
Loving womankind (womankind)
As lions love Christians
So who are you to deny
Who are you to deny them, Sarah?
(Sarah...)

(Echo, echo...)

(Round and round and round and round and round...)
