Baby, baby, please believe me

I would never never do anything to hurt you

Baby, baby, please believe me

I would never never do anything to you to make you blue

But yesterday I got this letter

From the boy I loved before I ever knew you

Before I even knew you


And the train from Kansas city is coming into town.

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around.


Baby, baby, please believe me

Nothing in this world would tear us apart

We'll never, never part

So wait right here and I will hurry

I'll be back in the time it takes to break a heart

I gotta break his heart


'Cause the train from Kansas city is coming into town

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around


No, I never answered his letter

I just couldn't tell him that way

No, I never answered his letter

I just didn't know what to say

Now I'm going down to the station

I'll be there at ten after two

I'll show him the ring on my finger

I don't what else I can do


The train from Kansas city is coming into town

The train from Kansas city is a-coming

And there's nothing I can do can make it turn around


Here comes the train
