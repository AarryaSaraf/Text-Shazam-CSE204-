I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


When I got home from work

I was feeling pretty fine

'Til I started getting hiccups 'round suppertime

Held my breath 'til I hit the floor

But the hiccups kept coming

Even more more more


I asked my baby to stand up on a chair

And when I wasn't looking

She would give me a scare

I drank a glass of water

And I blew into a bag

But the hiccups kept a-comin

A nag nag nag


I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


Well I was feeling low

But my baby made me go

Down to the honky tonk and hillbilly show

An hour in the line-up

And I finally made the door

But the hiccups kept a-coming

Even more more more


First I heard the music

And then I felt a beat

And that's when I knew

That the hiccups would retreat

I headed for the dance floor

I really did my best

I did The Rump Jump

I guess the whiskey did the rest


I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor


Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I got the honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

Honky tonk hiccups

Ready steady go

I found the cure on the hardwood floor

I found the cure on the hardwood floor

The only cure is the hardwood floor

(Hic!)
