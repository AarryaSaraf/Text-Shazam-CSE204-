I'm a dreaming man

Yes that's my problem

(Dreaming man)

I can't tell when I'm

Not being real

In the meadow dusk

I park my Aerostar

(Dreaming man)

With a loaded gun

And sweet dreams of you


I'll always be a dreaming man

I don't have to understand

I know it's all right


See your curves and I

Feel your vibrations

(Dreaming man)

You're dressed in black and white

You're lost in the mall

I watch you disappear

Past Club Med vacations

(Dreaming man)

Another sleepless night

A sun that won't fall


I'll always be a dreaming man

I don't have to understand

I know it's all right


Now the night is gone

A new day is dawning

(Dreaming man)

And our homeless dreams

Go back to the street

Another time or place

Another civilization

(Dreaming man)

That really make this life

Feel so complete


I'll always be a dreaming man

I don't have to understand

I know it's all right


Dreaming man

He's got a plan

(Dreaming man)

Dreaming man

He's got a plan

(Dreaming man)

Dreaming man

He's got a plan

Dreaming man
