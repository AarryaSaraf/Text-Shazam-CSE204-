I put on that sweater you gave me

I woke up in the kitchen a few minutes later

I didn't know how I had gotten there

Did you guide me

I didn't make it to your funeral

I didn't want ritual nor resign

I just wanted to hold hands with

J.P and Mary-Jo

But I couldn't conjure tears

We're too good for stupid angels

Blackness held its breath beside me

And burned the air till it was gone

Till it was gone

Till it was gone


Couldn't pay my respects to a dead man

Your life was much more to me

And I chased away with sticks and stones

But that rage kept following me

Following Me

Following Me

So lost I was asleep in the palms of your hand

In dreams we were happy and safe

I can't comprehend the ways I miss you

They come to light in my mistakes

In my mistakes

In my mistakes

Now I'm travelling down Tacoma way

And the world turns in slow motion

It's the twilight of our old home

And I'm still in love with you

Oh here on South Tacoma way

We've memories for matinees

And the tears come warm and heavy

And the cross streets bare your name

And the cross streets bare your name
