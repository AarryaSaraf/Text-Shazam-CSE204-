Well if you've been a married woman and things didn't seem to work out

Well Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free but you're gonna be talked about

Everybody knows that you've loved once, and they think you'll love again

You can't have a male friend if you're a has been, or a woman, rated X


And if you're rated X you're some kind of gold even men turning silver try to make

But I think it's wrong to judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake

And when your best friend's husband says to you you've sure started lookin' good

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X


Well nobody knows where you're goin' but they sure know where you've been,

All their thinking of is your experience of love, all their minds eat up with sin

The women all look at you like you're bad and the men all hope you are

But if you go too far you're gonna wear the scar of a woman rated X


Well if you're rated X you're some kind of gold even men turning silver try to make

But I think it's wrong to judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake

And when your best friend's husband says to you, you've sure started looking good

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X

You should've known he would and he would if he could and he will if you're rated X
