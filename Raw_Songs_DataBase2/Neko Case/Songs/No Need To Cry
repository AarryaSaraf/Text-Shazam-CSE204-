Lie in bed and ignore the TV

Watch the clouds sift through the aero

And you'll be in my arms again

There's no need to cry


Of all the things so bittersweet

You're the first thing I see in morning and in sleep

And you'll be in my arms again

There's no need to cry


Years have been lost but can never be replaced

But my thoughts are with you

Tied to that interstate

And you'll be in my arms tonight


There's no need to cry

There's no need to cry

There's no need to cry
