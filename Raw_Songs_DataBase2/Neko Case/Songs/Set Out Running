Want to get it all behind me

You know everything reminds me

I can't be myself without you

Want to crawl down deep inside

The springs inside the mattress

Where l cry my dirty secrets

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

Past the city houses

And the ditches on the highway

Read between the seasons

Under the bridges in valleys

Til the winds out on the prairie

Whip the tears from my eyes


Want to get it all behind me

You know everything reminds me

I can't be myself without you

Want to crawl down deep inside

the springs inside the mattress where I cry my dirty secrets

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

Across the muddy river

And the smokestacks on the bank

Swallow that horizon

Hunger beyond hunger

Til the cloudy blue Pacific

Took the air in my lungs


And if I knew heartbreak was coming

I would've set out running

'Cause I just can't shake this feeling

That I'm nothing in your eyes.
