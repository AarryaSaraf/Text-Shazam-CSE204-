I didn't know what a brute I was 

I dipped my cigarette and rode the bus 

Vengeance built me hastily 

And I drag the clanging notion I was nobody, nobody 

Nobody 


All I had was my invention 

And my love it fitted on you 

Oh, look what thoughts can do 

What thoughts can do 

If you're not by now dead and buried 

You're most certifiably married 

Oh, married 


I'm sure you're sleeping sound 

With a mistress of the hours 

The hours that grind your life to dust 


Oh, easy loves 

You keep lap pets 

Denied them you are powerless 

Whatever keeps you sleeping through the night 


I'm not the man you thought I was 

My love has never lived indoors 

I had to drag it home by force 

Hired hounds at both my wrists 

Damp and bruised by stranger's kisses on my lips 

But you're the one that I still miss 

You're the one that I still miss 

And the truth is that it comes as no surprise 


I'm not the man you think I am 

I'm not the man you think I am
