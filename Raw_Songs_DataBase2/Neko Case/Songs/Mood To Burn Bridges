So many people live in my town

And mind to my business but none of their own

They're all so happy now that I've done wrong

I'm surprised they don't come up and thank me


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day, baby


Don't make mistakes or be human

They savor your every false move

And the fear that they hide looking for a Break

If ever confronted with truth


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day, baby


From the well of their hearts spring the poison

That mixed with suspicion and reckless derision

And something they read on a church toilet stall

They think that their lives are much better

Than mine on the soapbox and ladders stand tall


So if you want moral advice

I suggest you just tuck it all away

'Cause my mood to burn bridges

Parallels my mood to dig ditches

Don't cross me on neither a day


I see those arrows beside me

I hear you right behind me

Don't cross me on neither a day
