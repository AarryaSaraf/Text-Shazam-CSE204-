Make your bed the river young girl

Make your bed the river young girl

La la la la la la:

Make your bed the river young girl


Did you come here to meet him my dear

You're surprised to find only me

Well I put him to rest at the bend in the river

And the same I require of you


I'm thick with disease in my madness

Only one thought pacifies me

That the murky black water grounds your bones to sand

When the catfish have stripped off your hide


Make your bed the river young girl

Make your bed the river young girl

I know you can't swim but I'll tuck you in

Make your bed the river young girl


So go down as his trembling bride

For too frail are fury inside

And if there's a chance the Lord recognizes you

Pray he has more mercy than I


Make your bed the river young girl

Make your bed the river young girl

I know you can't swim but I'll tuck you in

Make your bed the river young girl


Make your bed the river young girl
