You'll come in with the sun in the mornin'

Like you've done so often before

But you won't find me asleep on the sofa

Exhausted from walkin' the floor


'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

My heart was slippin' away

'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

Somebody led me away


And this time the note on your pillow

Will go a lot more than "I'm through"

For the guilt I'm feeling this time over leaving

Is that it's so easy to do


'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

My heart was slippin' away

'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on,

Somebody led me away
