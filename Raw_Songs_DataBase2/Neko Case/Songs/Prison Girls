Where am I tonight? La, da, da 

My hotel room won't remember me 

And this dream will die, die by morning 

And this dream won't remember me 


Awakened by a droning voice 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

Is it a lady or is it a man 

Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan 


I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 


On my feet to chase it down 

The lights were spokes and rungs away 

I stumbled back and hit the floor 

Long shadows crawl beneath the door 

To a passage so poorly lit 

There's moths flying away from it 


Who am I tonight? La, da, da 

My hotel room won't remember me 

Darkness enter prison girls 

Pushing mops and kicking pails 

Now's my chance 

I clasp my chest 

And declare unto my audience 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 


Prison girls are not impressed 

They're the ones that have to clean this mess 

They've traded more for cigarettes 

Than I've managed to express 


Filing past miles long 

The cheek is frozen to the floor 

The prison girls have filled their beds 

Their thoughts too dry above their heads 


I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes
