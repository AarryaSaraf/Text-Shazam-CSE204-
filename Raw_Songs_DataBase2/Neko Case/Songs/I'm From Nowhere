Goodnight, sunshine
The ghetto-bird shines 4 am,
Welcome to the West
A mosquito to kiss your hands and feet
Welcome to this dirty business

I was surprised
When you called me a lady
Cause I'm still not so sure that that's what I wanna be
Cause I remember the 80's
And I remember its puffy sleeves
You say I'm lucky to be here,
Then maybe you can take this over
And I'll gladly wear the pants into the next century
Past the scanners with ease

Past armies of them,
Who once played in a band
And wasted it complaining like a trust fund kid
Paying you to play here while they hate you because of it.
You say I'm "lucky to be here",
But I've been driving for 21 days.

What's that nasty sound?
The E-brake drags the ground...
God, if you only knew
What my candied fist could do.
The curtain's closing in from all direction,
Just answer my question.
Perhaps it's best if I continue
Starring me as you, me as you.
Starring me as you, me as you.

And there you are,
At the edge of the world...
Dangling with my heart a' pounding.
Above a gulf of hamstrung promises
You sang like "Auld Lang Syne",
You wanted it so badly that you believed them at the time

With every fashion's flame,
Every jet plane-lie,
Every second helping of that off-ramp fame we die,
A little...

You're right, I'm from Nowhere
You're right, I'm from Nowhere
You're right, I'm from Nowhere
You're right.
