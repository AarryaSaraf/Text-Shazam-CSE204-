I spent my life becoming invisible
It's hard to maintain and it's hard to get by
I don't recall, fight or flight setting in
I had no introduction
I just breathe it in like the air

And there's nothing to remember
There is nothing to remember

I owe you nothing
That's all I've got for you
And you'll borrow nothing
That's what you expect of me
So you send me a love
Out of thin sailor's knots
And I fear underneath the weight of your thoughts
My footsteps now they won't echo too loudly

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And I'll give you those

You told me something that scared me to death
Don't take me home
I can't face that yet
I'm ashamed that I'm barely human
And I'm ashamed that I don't have a heart you can break
I'm just action
And other times reaction

All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
All I own
All I own
Are the strides I spend to the finish line
And I'll give you those
Just don't make me go home

Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
Give me something to remember
