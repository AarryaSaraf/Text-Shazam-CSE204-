When I was young, I knew a girl

Who wouldn't love god as a test

Or gamble with her happiness

And so led astray


So she did turn

Her father would say,

'You're only a guest of the master'


But passion was her sunday best

And she fell away

She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na


When she grew up, she fell in love

She thought it was all that she wanted

She knew how it felt to be haunted

And he ran away


Picked herself up

And said through her tears

Don't waste anymore of your time

You'll spend it all standing in line

They'll turn you away


She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na


Oh but superstition

And your heart's permission

'Cause you're good enough, good enough, good enough

To make it alone


Then when she died

She didn't ask god

To take her back into his graces

She'd taken on to many shapes

And too many were strange


And as they lay her in to the ground

Her spirits, they all flew all away

The sun shone so bright on that day

You thought it was spring


She fell away

She fell away

She fell away from the side of the lord

And she was free to do what she wanted

With clouds of her own

Na na na na
