Thanks a lot

I got a broken heart

That's all I've got

You made me cry

Now I cried a lot

I lost your love baby

Thanks a lot


You told our friend

As I was passin' by

That you're not sorry

That you made me cry

You said I deserve

Just what I got

Well if that's how you feel babe

Thanks a lot

You wanted a fool

& I played the part

Now all I've got is a broken heart

We loved a little

& laughed a lot

Then you were gone

Honey thanks a lot
