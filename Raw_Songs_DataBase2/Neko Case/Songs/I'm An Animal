You could say it's my instinct
Yes, I still have one
There's no time to second guess it
Yes, there are things that I'm still so afraid of
But my courage is roaring like the sound of the sun
Cause it's vain about its mane
And will reveal them to no one

Now I'm an animal
You're an animal, too

Pick up that rock (drink from that lake)
I do my best but I'm made of mistakes
Yes, there are things I'm still quite sure of
I love you this hour
This hour today
And heaven will smell like the airport (airport)
But I may never get there to prove it
So let's not waste our time thinking how that ain't fair

I'm an animal
You're an animal, too

You're an animal, too
