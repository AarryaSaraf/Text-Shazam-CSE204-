Sittin' here lost in my senses

Drownin' in old memories

Brought down from on high

When you said goodbye

Seems all that I lived for were lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Mind's all tied up with wild senses

It's not how I thought love would be

My heart from inside

Has burst open wide

Seems all that that have lived there were lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned

In you


Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned

Oh moon river, I'll follow you down

How many sorrows have drowned


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Lonely old lies

Your rhetoric cries

I'll never learn nothin' from you

Jukebox is on

It's playin' our song

And the words are like lonely old lies


Lies, lies, lies...
