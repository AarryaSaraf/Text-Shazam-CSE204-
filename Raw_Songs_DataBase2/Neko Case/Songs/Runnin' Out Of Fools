Are you sure you got the right number

Is it me you wanna talk to tonight

Everyone in town's got your number

Everybody's got you pegged right


Is that why you got in touch with me

Ohhh, guess you must be runnin' out of fools


You left me all alone right here

Your goodbye was even colder than last

Didn't bother you I was cryin'

Now you wanna break my heart twice


Is that why you got in touch with me

Ohhh, guess you must be runnin' out of fools


You got back to my name in your little black book

Tell you what I guess you forgot how I even look

Yes you did


So go ahead with all your sweet talkin'

Go ahead for all the good it can do

Have yourself a dime's worth of talkin'

Then I'm gonna hang right up on you


'Cause this time you're not getting through to me

Ohhh, gues you must be runnin' out of fools


Even fools like me (fools like me)

Even fools like me


Runnin' out of fools (fools like me)

Even fools like me (fools like me)
