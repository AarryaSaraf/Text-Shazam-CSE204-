Rain falls, I fix my eyes

Let go of the focus and I blur out all the lines

Just to remember, remember


Crying 'cause it's not my fault

Water through my lashes look just like Christmas lights

And I still remember, remember


Cold and shivering

Cold and shivering

Cold and shivering warm


Sing please, rock me to sleep

Quiet as a canyon up under heaven's eaves

I surrender, surrender


Downstairs the furnace swells

Safe from all the horrors in your stinging velvet arms

And I surrender, surrender


Cold and shivering

Cold and shivering

Cold and shivering warm
