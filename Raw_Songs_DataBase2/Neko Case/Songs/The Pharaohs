You were married in the mirrored hall when I was 16 

You spoke the words, "I love girls in white leather jackets" 

That was good enough for love, it was good enough for me 


I listened in when you thought you were lost 

Caught in those fangs on a tornado sprawl 


Who knows what you know 

I only heard what I wanted 

You said I was your blue, blue baby 

And you were right 

You said I was your blue, blue baby 

And you were right 


Wondered the halls of the nighttime 

My body burned, my legs ached 

But you never came to bed 

You just left me there awake 


You kept me wanting wanting wanting 

Like the wanting in the movies and the hymns 

I want the pharaohs, but there's only men 

I want the pharaohs, but there's only men 


You said I was your new blue baby 

And you were right 

You said I was your new blue baby 

And you were right
