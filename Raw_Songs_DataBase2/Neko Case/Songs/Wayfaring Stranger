I am a poor wayfaring stranger

A-traveling thru this world below

But there's no sickness, toil, or danger

In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my Father

I'm going there no more to roam

I'm just a-going over Jordan

I'm just a-going over home


I am a poor wayfaring stranger

A-traveling thru this world below

But there's no sickness, toil, or danger

In that bright land to which I go

I'm going there to see my mother

She said she'd meet me when I come

I'm just a-going over Jordan

I'm just a-going over home

I'm just a-going over home

I'm just a-going over home
