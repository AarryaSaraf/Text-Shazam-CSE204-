Dressmaker, dressmaker,

I'm singing at the hall next saturday night and he'll be there.

He's been gone for so long, I want him back again,

Make me the sweetest dress you can.


Make it a soulful shade of blue with a ribbon at the hem,

A ribbon white for loyalty to show that I remember when

A soulful shade of blue looked into my eyes

And tell him I want him back again


Dressmaker, dressmaker, don't make it loud or bright, just make it a sweet and gentle style

Then maybe he'll remember me it was not so long ago I'll miss his sweet and gentle smile


Make it a soulful shade of blue with a ribbon at the hem,

A ribbon white for loyalty to show that I remember when

A soulful shade of blue looked into my eyes

And tell him I want him back again


Make it a soulful shade of blue
