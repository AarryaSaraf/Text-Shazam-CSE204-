// Everybody Wants To Go To Heaven //

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Once upon a time there lived a man
And his name was Hezekiah
He walked with God both day and night
But he didn't wanna die

He cried, "Oh Lord, please let me live
Death is close, I know"
God smiled down on Hezekiah
And gave him fifteen years to go

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

When Jesus lived here on this Earth
He knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life
To save the soul of man

When Judas had betrayed him
His father heard him cry
He was brave until his death
But he didn't wanna die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

// Secret Love //

Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon, my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils
At last, my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon, my secret love
Became impatient to be free

Now I shout it from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils
At last, my heart's an open door
And my secret love is no secret anymore

// Whispering Sea //

I sat down by the sea and it whispered to me
It brought back an old love affair that used to be
It told me that you had found someone new
And lead me to cry over you

Whispering sea rolling by, now don't you listen to me cry?
I cry as though my heart is broke in two
Oh, how I love him so, no one will ever know
No one but the drifting, whispering sea

Well, I thought I'd left behind all his love but I was blind
I should have known that there was no use to pretend
I thought a new love I would find, and you would never cross my mind
But the whispering sea, it talked to me

Whispering sea rolling by, now don't you listen to me cry?
I cry as though my heart is broke in two
Oh, how I love him so, no one will ever know
No one but the drifting, whispering sea

// Fist City //

You've been making your brags around town
That you've been a-loving my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
That's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of the head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet, if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of the head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City

I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
