// Success //

We used to go out walkin' hand in hand you told me all the big things you had planned
It wasn't long till all your dreams came true success put me in second place with you
You have no time to love me anymore since fame and fortune knocked upon our door
Now I spend all my evenings all alone success has made a failure of our home
[ fiddle - steel ]
If we could share an evening now and then perhaps we'd find true happiness again
You never hold me like you used to do it's funny what success has done to you
You have no time to love me...

// Minute You're Gone //

The minute you're gone I cry the minute you're gone I die
Before you walked out of sight I'm like a child all alone at night
I stare into emptiness I'm filled with such loneliness
My world goes from right to wrong the minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see just how lonely I'm gonna be
My life would be oh so blue if I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone
[ piano ]
The minute you're gone I pray the minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long the minute you're gone

// Other Woman //

I'd like to introduce myself
I'm the other woman the other woman in your husband's life
The whole town's buzzin' bout us and our stolen moments
They're callin' you the true and faithful wife
But you gave him the right to seek that other woman
And you know who was first to cheat on who
I just accepted love from him you never wanted
The other woman didn't steal from you
[ steel ]
Now everybody's blaming me I'm the other woman
But who are they to judge who's wrong or right
Their whispers might be different if they knew what I know
The husband still beats you home ever night
But you gave him the right...

// Alone With You //

How I love to be around you when the lonely night surrounds you
How I love to be alone with you
How I love to have the power to read your mind one hour
How I love to be alone with you
Just to be with you one night you and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight have you for my own
This would be a joy unending could be a real beginning
How I love to be alone with you
[ ac.guitar ]
How I'd love to be around you when the lonely night surrounds you
How I love to be alone with you
If I only knew for certain I'd cut out all my flirtin'
How I love to be alone with you
Just to be with you one night...
How I love to be alone with you how I love to be alone with you

// Why I'm Walkin' //

I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart well I ain't talkin'
The hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love in your heart life's not worth livin'
I breathe his name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why can't he ever see how much he means to me
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
[ steel ]
When I pass you on the street and I miss speakin'
Just blame it on this memory I'm keepin'
My head is bowed down low the hurt is bound to show
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'

// Girl That I Am Now //

Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now
Tonight I'm in his arms but he just don't seem the same
I cheated and I'm guilty my heart is standing pain
I let passions fill my mind from my heart and conscience blind
I feel now mighty low and I pray he'll never know
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now
[ steel - piano ]
It almost breaks my heart when he says that he loves me
I know that I'm not worthy and that's what troubles me
If he do what I had done could he still feel just the same
I would be still the way I do guilty and ashamed
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now
Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now

// Act Naturally //

They're gonna put me in the movies they're gonna make a big star out of me
They'll make a film about a girl who's sad and lonely and all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies are gonna make me a big star cause I can play the part so well
I hope you'll come to see me in the movies then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time and all I gotta do is act naturally
[ ac.guitar ]
We'll make a scene about a girl that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon her bended knee
I'll play the part that I won't need rehearsing all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you...
And all I gotta do is act naturally and all I gotta do is act naturally

// World Of Forgotten People //

I live in the world world of forgotten people
Who've loved and lost their hearts so many times
I'm here in the world world of forgotten people
Where every heart is aching just like mine

Well I've loved and I'd been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had are torn apart
Now I find out I was loved too late I'm all alone alone in the world of broken heart
I live in the world...

// Color Of The Blues //

Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
These things are the colors of the blues
In the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same
Blue must be the color of the blues
Bluebird's singin' in the trees seems to sympathize with me
But he ain't singin' like he used to do
The pearly waters in the sea are as cold as you left me
Blue must be the color of the blues

There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
Blue must be the color angels choose
A blue suit you proudly wore when you left to return no more
Blue must be the color of the blues
Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows
Life is mighty empty without you
There's a blue note in each song that I sang since you've been gone
Blue must be the color of the blues

// Hundred Proof Heartache //

I've got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues
My baby's gone and left me I've lost all I can lose
I've got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turnin' round
This hundred proof heartache's got me down
You waded through my tears and said goobye
You didn't seem to care how much I'd cry
You made your home the tavern down the street
And this old heart cries out with every beat
I've got a hundred proof heartache and a case of the blues
You're holdin' someone else tonight I just got the news
You left a hundred proof heartache for a love that's second hand
This hundred proof heartache I can't stand
[ piano - steel ]
I've got a hundred proof heartache my world keeps turnin' round
This hundred proof heartache's got me down

// I Walked Away From The Wreck //

I walked away from the wreck of our love affair
And no one knew how I was hurt because I lie
I walked away from the wreck but it broke my heart
And I'm off myself and broken inside
And when I see you with her I still wanna scream
It's like a bad bad dream that never seems to end
I walked away from the wreck of our love affair
But I'll never never be the same again
[ steel ]
I saw the danger ahead but I paid no mind
For it seemed such harmless fun at the start
Too fights the crowd too much wine too much playing round
Then came the crash and my world fell apart
And when I see you...

// Lonesome 7-7203 //

Had our number changed today although I hated to
But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you
And it hurts to tell them you're not here with me
Maybe now oh telephone will let me be
It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down
Just in case your love for me should ever come around
You might want to call and break the news to me just dial Lonesome 7-7203
[ steel ]
I keep the telephone beside me all the time
Hoping you might want to call and say you've changed your mind
If you do then darling you know where I'll be I'm at Lonesome 7-7203
You're the only one I'm givin' out new number to
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you
If you ever long for love that used to be just call Lonesome 7-7203
