// Who's Gonna Take The Garbage Out //

I take too much abuse to me that's all I ever get
Yeah callin' a man like you a husband is just like callin' old wild cat a pet
You'd better stop your runnin' around say nothin' stop movin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone

Each day you walk off over me can't you take another out
If you start actin' like married man maybe we could find the way to work things out
You'll find your key won't fit the lock if you keep on a keepin' on
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone

I know you think I'm runnin' round and that's why you're so peaked
That's another lie of that same old stuff but I hope you don't expect me to believe
Though after night you don't come back cause you just love the home
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone

I know you think I'm runnin' round and that's why you're so peaked
That's another lie of that same old stuff but I hope you don't expect me to believe
Though after night you don't come back cause you just love the home
But who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone

Honey who's gonna take your garbage out when I've packed my bags and gone
You're gonna miss me honey gal
Ah you're kiddin'

// Holding On To Nothin' //

We're holding on with nothin' left to hold on to
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times that we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream and still go on bluffin'
With really nothing left to hold on to

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other that's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to

We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long how hard we've tried

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other that's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to

// Somewhere Between //

I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key.

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you.

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again.

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you...

// I Chased You Till You Caught Me //

I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

Well, it was a long hard race I thought I've finally won
I thought I really played it smart but brother was I dumb
You thought you'd pull to figure out and won my heart and hand
But things were only workin' out accordin' to my plans.

I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

Now you were playin' hard to get just danglin' on a string
I was only holdin' out for a pretty weddin' ring
So you went to the jewelry's to get my big surprise
But you done been there a month before and given them your size.

I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

It don't really matter to me just who caught who...

// Let's Wait A Little Longer //

I can see you are not happy the way you've been acting
And I think you'd like to be free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can be
A whole lot happier with me.

In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're a burning
And I'd like to put out the flame
So let's get together like birds of a feather
And we let the love take the blame.

But right now I don't think that I can leave him
For lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see.

But the way I can make you forget him 'cause I'll take you
To places that you've never been
We may call the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've been.

We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches
And swing from Maine to Mexico
If you'll come along we can make life a song
And you won't be tied down anymore.

But still I don't think that I can leave him
For lately he's been so good to me
And there might be one more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see.

Yes, let's wait a little longer then we'll see...

// Won't You Come Home And Talk To A Stranger //

Well, I was out a drinking with a couple of friends of mine
When the bartender handed me the telephone
And said there's my wife on the line
Well, I told her I was just a drinking with the couple of buddies I knew
But she told me in a few short words just what she wanted me to do

She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been

Well, I sat there about an hour a talking with the rest of the guys
When she walked to that front door she had get home in her eyes
She said you've talked and danced with every woman in town but me
If you just come around the house you might like my company

She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been
It's the only place in days you haven't been

// Let The World Keep On A Turnin' //

Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away and
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side

Please don't pay me attention to someone that they should mention
That they saw me in the arms of Mary Jane
Oh, it's plain they're only jealous and their hearts are filled with malice
Their intention is to only bring us pain

Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away and
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side

When they try to cause us trouble we'll politely pop their bubble
By ignoring any gossip they might start
So let the north wind keep a blowin' we'll be safe cause we'll be a knowin'
That our love is safely locked inside our hearts

Let the world keep on a turnin', let the fire keep on a burnin'
Let our love keep on a growin' to the sky
Let our ship of love keep sailin', keep the storm clouds far away and
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side
Hand in hand we'll walk together side by side

// If We Put Our Heads Together //

When I'm cryin', just cryin' over what we've become
That's not but cry though I look there on the demage that we've done
We can start here not parted for there's hope for me and you
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take two
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

It's not rain it's just pain runnin' down my face
I feel certain that's a hurtin' won't leave any trace
We'll erase it just replace it with a love we once knew
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take two
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do...

// That Odd Couple //

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

Today a friend of mine came by
Said let's do the town
I can't fix you up
With a cutiest thing around.

She's what I was jokin'
When I told him patiently
The only woman that I want
Is waitin' at home for me.

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

A neighbor on our left
Talked with our neighbor on our right
A man across the street
Goes out almost every night.

I've heard a different man each night
Each is life company
They all think we're square
'Cause we're happy as can be.

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other.

Yes, we're a man and wife
In love with each other...

// Touch And Go //

The two hands of a clock are what we measure our love by
A moment stolen here and there to hold each other tight
They're suspicious and to linger would only make it grow
Our wedding rings and ties they bring make our love touch and go

The whispering talk of others is the price we have to pay
It wouldn't be so bad but then it's getting worse each day
And we'll surely hurt somebody cause they still love us so
It's borrowed time when love's this kind and our love's touch and go

Touch and go our separate ways until we meet again
Make up lies to satisfy the ones who ask us where we've been
But I'd rather have it this way than to never ever know
What true love is although our kiss is only touch and go

Touch and go our separate ways until we meet again
Make up lies to satisfy the ones who ask us where we've been
But I'd rather have it this way than to never ever know
What true love is although our kiss is only touch and go

// I Won't Cheat on You Again (If You Won't Cheat On Me) //

You love to put me down each time you're out with your girlfriends
They ask you if I treat you bad you say that all depends
Well don't you know they realize that you've been slippin' round
They know how you carry on when I go out of town

You've got no room to criticize with words you know will hurt
I'm still countin' lipstick stains on your dirty shirt
People pass me on the street and shake their heads in pity
While I wait at home you've got a girl in ever city

Yes I'll admit it what you say is true
But I only run around because you do it too
If we could have what we once had how happy we could be
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me

You'll never know how many nights I've stayed awake and cried
Ashamed of what I did to you and feelin' sick inside
Now I can walk away from him without a backward glance
I'm grateful that you're big enough to give me a second chance

Now many nights in many towns I've wrestled with the blues
I never found the nighttime girl who could fill your shoes
How I wish I'd swallowed pride and come to you before
You'll never find another man who could love you more

Yes I'll admit it what you say is true
But I only run around because you do it too
If we could have what we once had how happy we could be
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me
