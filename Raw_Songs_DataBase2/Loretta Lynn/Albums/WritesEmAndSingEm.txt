// You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) //

You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him oh but I don't think you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over and I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man

Sometimes a man start lookin' at things that he don't need
He took a second to look at you but he's in love with me
Well I don't know where that leaves you oh but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man

Women like you they're a dime a dozen you can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him I'd have to move over and I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body so get out while you can
Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
No you ain't woman enough to take my man

// Your Squaw Is On The Warpath //

Well your pet name for me is Squaw
When you come home a drinkin' and can barely crawl
And all that lovin' on me won't make things right
Well you leave me at home to keep the teepee clean
Six papooses to break and when wean
Well your squaw is on the warpath tonight
Well I've found out a big brave chief the game you're a huntin' for ain't beef
Get off of my huntin' grounds and get out of my sight
This war dance I'm doin' means I'm fightin' mad
You need no more of what you've already had
Your squaw is on the warpath tonight
[ guitar ]
Well that fire-water that you've been drinking
Makes you feel bigger but chief you're shrinking
Since you've been on that love making diet
Now don't hand me that ole peace pipe there ain't no pipe can settle this fight
Your squaw is on the warpath tonight
Well I've found out a big brave chief...
Yeah your squaw is on the warpath tonight
