// Living My Lifetime For You //

Many heartaches have passed since we met there's a kind that a heart can't forget
And the sweet memories are too few while I'm living my lifetime for you
I'm living my life for you you're living to break me in two
I'd die while you're being untrue still I'm living my lifetime for you
[ guitar ]
If ever there should come a time when you feel that you'd like to die
Well you've made me feel that way too but I'm living my lifetime for you
I'm living my life for you...

// Barney //

You can take Barney out of the bar room, but
You can't take the bar out of Barney

Barney likes  to smoke em filter-tipped cigarettes
And if he can't get a blonde then he'll take a brunette
And all the while he's drinking from the pop top can
He'll be telling lies to a cute redhead

With a smile on his lips and a drink in his hand
That's how you can always recognize my man
Barney's plenty ugly with his eyes all red
So bring him on a'home and I'll put him to bed

You can take Barney out of the bar room, but
You can't take the bar out of Barney

Barney wins a'playin' with the dice that he throws
But the one armed bandits get a lot of his dough
To win a game of cards, well, he might have to cheat
But he'll give it to a buddy gettin' back on his feet

Oh, that's my Barney sittin' there hardly able
I'd reckon he can drink us all under the table
I've seen him a lotta times high as a kite
They put him in jail for tryin' to fight

You can take Barney out of the bar room, but
You can't take the bar out of Barney

Come on, Barney.  Let's go home!
Barney, it's gettin' late!
Will someone please help me get him outta here?

// Sneakin' In //

It's now three o'clock in the morning the doorknob turns and you tiptoe to bed
You think you're sneakin' in you should know better
I know exactly what goes on inside your head
You've been with the boys so you'll tell me
It's a lie because I know right where you've been
I followed you tonight and watched you kiss her
Don't be so quite cause you're not sneakin' in
Next time you're sneakin' in ring the doorbell
Cause I won't be here to see the shape you're in
I've been losin' lots of sleep over nothin'
And I'm tired of hearin' nothin' sneakin' in
[ steel ]
And I'm tired of hearin' nothin' sneakin' in

// You've Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out On Me) //

You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
And break that you've been on another spree
If you don't settle down and change your way
I'll wound up steppin' out on you someday
I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should
You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
You're not the faithful man I thought you'd be
Many nights I've wondered what you'd do if you caught me a steppin' out on you
[ piano ]
I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should
You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
I'll bet your conscience hurts you constantly
Oh time and time again you've been untrue so I'll just step in from steppin' out on you

// Taking The Place Of My Man //

You ask why I'm wastin' myself on the wine
And if I'll come with you you show me a good time
Well haven't you noticed these rings on my hand
This bottle is taking the place of my man
They called him to dudy but I have one too
Bein' true to the man who is fighting for you
I got lonesome without him so I found me a friend
This bottle is taking the place of my man
[ steel ]
I'm not proud of this bottle just got proud in one thing
Ever since he's been gone I've been true to his name
I'll be just like he left me when he come home again
This bottle is taking the place of my man
You can buy me a drink but I think you should know
That a drink and some talk is as far as I go
I'll be nobody's woman till he holds me again
This bottle is taking the place of my man

// Kaw-Liga //

Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign because his heart was made of knoty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he never got a kiss poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head

Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
And took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be and wishes he was still an old pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga...
Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head

// Let Me Go You're Hurtin' Me //

Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
I've lost all your love so I can't understand
Are you holdin' on to just show me you can
This grip you have on me is as tight as it can be
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
Stayin' here unwanted will be the death of me
Needing love that you won't give me so desperately
It's more than I can stand let me go for I still can
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me

Got no place to go but I'll go anyway if I go I'll cry and I'll cry if I stay
I still love you can't you see and I don't want to be free
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
Stayin' here unwanted...

// Harper Valley P.T.A. //

I wanna tell you all a story bout the Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley's Junior High
Well her daughter come home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said mom I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA
Well the note said Mrs Johnson you're wearin' your dresses way too high
And it's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way
Yeah it was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
Well when you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way
The day my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA
Yeah my mama socket it to the Harper Valley PTA
My mama really socket it to the Harper Valley PTA

// I Walk Alone //

I walk alone where once we wandered it seems so strange that you are gone
Till you return I'll stay the same dear I'll still be true and walk alone
The flame of love is brightly burning you know that I'm your very own
Till you return I'll stay the same dear I'll still be true and walk alone
[ piano ]
The flame of love...

// He's Somewhere Between You And Me //

I don't know the location he's usin' he's so close and still I can't see
But I know all the heartache he's bringin' sure he's somewhere between you and me
When you say that you love me I don't doubt it
But he tells me the same things you see
All I know he's on my mind much too often cause he's somewhere between you and me
Yes he's somewhere between you and me give me time to erase his memory
Cause my heart has to be free completely and he's somewhere between you and me
[ guitar - steel ]
Yes he's somewhere...
Yes he's somewhere between you and me
