// Two Mules Pull This Wagon //

Well you come home most every night as grouchy as can be
And start right in a pickin' on our little kids and me
I'm sick and tired of hearin' are you worth keep you a trigon
Cause you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
Yeah two mules pull this wagon you don't do it by yourself
I know you've got a heavy load but it give you lots of hell
I do my share of pullin' and I don't mean to be bridled
But you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
[ guitar - steel ]
Well I guess you think while you're at work I sit and watch TV
But you'd learn different honey if you'd spent one day with me
I'm washin' ironin' cookin' so and find out for your nigher
But you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
Yeah two mules pull this wagon...
Yeah you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon

// It's Been So Long Darling //

It's been so long darlin' since you had to go away
It's been so long darlin' and I'll never forget that day
Although I never mentioned it I cried the whole day long
It's been so long darlin' but now you're comin' home

It's been so long darlin' but it won't be long now
It's been so long darlin' and I've kept ev'ry vow
You'll find me right here waitin' as you did in days gone by
It's been so long darlin' please don't blame me if I cry

It's been so long darlin' since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darlin' do you really realize
That's just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darlin' since I had a kiss from you
It's been so long darlin' but now you're comin' home

// Sometimes You Just Can't Win //

Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks all right again
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
And to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall you have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care but sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win

And then when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks all right again
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win
Yeah sometimes you just can't win

// If Teardrops Were Pennies //

If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the treasures my pockets would hold
I'd be oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

An acre of diamonds I'd offered to you a solid gold mansion an airplane or two
This world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
[ guitar - steel ]
If teardrops were pennies...

// Your Cheatin' Heart //

Your cheating heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do your cheating heart will tell on you
[ piano ]
Your cheating heart will pine someday and crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down...

// Go On And Go //

Why not tell me that I'm really losing you
It's no secret that you've found somebody new
I just hope that she'll love you the way I do
Go on and go if you need her like I need you
Go on and go if you want her I understand
Between your passion and your pride you're half a man
I don't want your kiss without your sweet love too
Go on and go if you need her like I need you
[ piano - guitar ]
Go on and go if you want her...

// Cry Cry Cry //

Everbody knows where you go when the sun goes down
I think you only live to see the lights uptown
I wasted my time when I would try try try
Cause when the lights have lost their glow you'll cry cry cry

Soon your sugar babies will all be gone
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone
You'll call for me but I'm a gonna tell you bye bye bye
When I turn around and I walk away you'll cry cry cry

You're gonna cry cry cry and you'll cry alone
When everone's forgotten and you're left on your own
You're gonna cry cry cry

I lie awake at night and wait till you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Ever question that I ask I git a lie lie lie
For ever lie you tell you're gonna cry cry

When your fickle love gets old no one will care for you
When you come back to me for a little love that's true
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why why why
When I remind you of all of this you'll cry cry cry

You're gonna cry cry cry and you'll cry and then
It'll hurt when you think of a fool you've been
You're gonna cry cry cry you're gonna cry cry cry

// Home You're Tearin' Down //

I don't know your name I wouldn't know your face
But you're right with the one I love out there someplace
You have an invitation be free to come around
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down
Once some happy faces would have met you at the door
But since their daddy's gone so much they don't smile anymore
There's shattered parts of broken hearts just scattered all around
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down
[ steel ]
I'll dry all my tears and have the coffee hot
Cause I can't sleep a wink no more time's all I've got
You see the price I'm payin' for happiness you've found
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down
You've told how much you loved him you can surely tell me too
I'd like to know just what you've done to make him turn to you
I swallow pride and hear you sigh if you'll just come around
Come over anytime and see the home you're tearin' down

// Hurtin' For Certain //

Hurtin' for certain (certainly hurtin')

I'm right here hurtin' for certain
Cryin' for now you've walked out
Left me a wearin' my heart on my sleeve
Hurtin' for certain dyin' I know it's over
My knees started shakin' when my heart saw you achin' to leave

Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Ev'ryway I turn's a gonna be a wrong wrong way
Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
It looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay

I stand here hurtin' for certain
Our love has gone it's washed up
You'll see me sufferin' both night and day
Hurtin' for certain grievin' my heart is broken
The tears started comin' when my eyes saw you runnin' away

Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Ev'ryway I turn's a gonna be another wrong wrong way
Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay
Yeah it looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay

// Today Has Been A Day //

Today has been a day filled with heartaches but tonight I'll be happy again
The flashing lights call out the lonely from the darkness
On each door reads the welcome come on in
Another night anothet fight with my mem'ries with a glass in my hand I forget
Today has gone with coming on I started cryin'
Today has been a day another day of regret
A cryzy fool oh what a fool to ever let you go
Now I can see you don't need me and that's what hurts me so
Yes today has been a day filled with misery just how lonesome can one poor girl get
I said today that I'd forget but I haven't yet
Today has been a day another day of regret
Today has been a day another day of regret

// Jealous Heart //

Jealous heart oh jealous heart stop beating can't you see the damage you have done
You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one
I was part of everything he planned for and I know he loved me from the start
Now he hates the sight of all I stand for all because of you oh jealous heart
[ piano - organ ]
Jealous heart why did I let you rule me when I knew the end would bring me pain
Now he's gone he's gone and found another oh I'll never see my love again
Through the years his memory will haunt me even though we're many miles apart
It's so hard to know he'll never want me cause he heard your beating jealous heart

// Dear Uncle Sam //

Dear Uncle Sam I know you're a busy man
And tonight I write to you through tears with a tremblin' hand
My darlin' answered when he got that call from you
You said you really need him but you don't need him like I do

Don't misunderstand I know he's fighting for our land
I really love my country but I also love my man
He proudly wears the colors of the ole red white and blue
While I wear a heartache since he left me for you

Dear Uncle Sam I just got your telegram
And I can't believe that this is me shakin' like I am
For it said I'm sorry to inform you
