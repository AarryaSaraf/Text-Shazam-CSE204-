Well, I was out a drinking with a couple of friends of mine
When the bartender handed me the telephone
And said there's my wife on the line
Well, I told her I was just a drinking with the couple of buddies I knew
But she told me in a few short words just what she wanted me to do

She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been

Well, I sat there about an hour a talking with the rest of the guys
When she walked to that front door she had get home in her eyes
She said you've talked and danced with every woman in town but me
If you just come around the house you might like my company

She said won't you come home and talk to a stranger
You might even make yourself a friend
So won't you come home and talk to a stranger
It's the only place in days you haven't been
It's the only place in days you haven't been
