Bitin' my fingernails thinkin' of you
Don't love nobody else it's funny but it's true
Just got a feelin' maybe we're through
Bitin' my fingernails and thinkin' dear of you

You really got me worried now I must confess it's true
I've sat around twiddlin' my thumbs breakin' my heart in two
I'm wondering if you love me so the way you say you do
I'm bitin' my fingernails and thinkin' dear of you

Bitin' my fingernails thinkin' of you
Don't love nobody else it's funny but it's true
Just got a feelin' maybe we're through
Bitin' my fingernails and thinkin' dear of you

If you have plans to end it all I wish you'd tell me now
Don't leave me thinkin' that someday you'll leave me anyhow
For I'll forget we ever met and find somebody new
I'm bitin' my fingernails and thinkin' dear of you

Bitin' my fingernails thinkin' of you
Don't love nobody else it's funny but it's true
Just got a feelin' maybe we're through
Bitin' my fingernails and thinkin' dear of you
