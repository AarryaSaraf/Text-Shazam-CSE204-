Why not tell me that I'm really losing you
It's no secret that you've found somebody new
I just hope that she'll love you the way I do
Go on and go if you need her like I need you
Go on and go if you want her I understand
Between your passion and your pride you're half a man
I don't want your kiss without your sweet love too
Go on and go if you need her like I need you

Go on and go if you want her...
