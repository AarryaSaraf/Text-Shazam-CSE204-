(To heck with ole Santa Claus)
Last year I hung and stopped by the chimney and ole Santa didn't bring me anything
Well I wrote a note and I told him what to bring me
But I didn't even hear his sleigh bells ring
So to heck with ole Santa Clause
When he goes dashin' through the snow I hope he falls
I like to hear him any (ho ho ho) with a bunch of big snowballs
To heck with ole Santa Claus

Last year I built a big fire by the fireplace I'll be like a little bit I read about
If that big bad wolf in red comes down my chimney
He's a gonna scorch his whiskers there's no doubt
So to heck with ole Santa Clause...
Yeah to heck with ole Santa Claus
