Ours was a love people said just couldn't last
They said we'd have no future cause we had too much past
But we're still together and we will always be
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me

No matter what we've ever done whether it be wrong or right
It led us to each other's arms and to this place tonight
So be thankful for a past without it we could never be
My past brough me to you your past brought you to me

We were unhappy so we started slippin' around
We met each other and we like what we found
We found a true love that will last eternaly
My past brought me to you your past brought you to me

No matter what we've ever done...
