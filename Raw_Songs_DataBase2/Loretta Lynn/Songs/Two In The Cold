You're just across the room but we're still a world apart
It's as though we built a wall of ice around our hearts
We should speak because there's so much to be tald
But we're locked in a silence just two in the cold

We had two hearts that beat in perfect kind
One broke the pattern was it yours or was it mine
We need command to break but pride has its hold
So we set the world apart just two in the cold

We let our silly quarrel devide our hearts
And it has left us more than just a room apart
We need to talk because there's so much to be tald
But we're locked in a silence just two in the cold

We had two hearts that beat...
