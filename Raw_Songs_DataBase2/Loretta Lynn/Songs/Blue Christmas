I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue heartaches start calling
You'll be doing all right...
