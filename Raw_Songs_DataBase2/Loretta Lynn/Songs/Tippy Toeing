Well mama go a tippy tippy toein' through the house
Gotta see what's the matter with the baby
It's been a bawlin' and a squallin' and a kickin' on the wall
Well I guess it's dropped its little bottle maybe
Oh daddy come a runnin' with the water and a rag
Gonna need another little diaper maybe
No need a hesitatin' or a wonderin' and a waitin' I know what's the matter with baby
Oh mama rock a baby daddy rock a baby too
It's a yawnin' and a gettin' sleepy maybe
So mama keep a rockin' daddy rock a little too and at last it's a sleepin' little baby

Well mama tippy toein' daddy tippy toein' too gonna try to do a little sleepin' maybe
Whether it'll be a minute or an hour or two is depending entirely on the baby
Well I hear the clock a ringin' just a dongin' and a dingin'
Daddy go and make a little money maybe
Mama sleep a little longer but remember while he's gone
Won't you please take care of the baby
Oh mama rock a baby...
And at last it's a sleepin' little baby after all it's a sleepin' little baby
After all it's a sleepin' little baby after all it's a sleepin' little baby
