Well your pet name for me is Squaw
When you come home a drinkin' and can barely crawl
And all that lovin' on me won't make things right
Well you leave me at home to keep the teepee clean
Six papooses to break and when wean
Well your squaw is on the warpath tonight
Well I've found out a big brave chief the game you're a huntin' for ain't beef
Get off of my huntin' grounds and get out of my sight
This war dance I'm doin' means I'm fightin' mad
You need no more of what you've already had
Your squaw is on the warpath tonight

Well that fire-water that you've been drinking
Makes you feel bigger but chief you're shrinking
Since you've been on that love making diet
Now don't hand me that ole peace pipe there ain't no pipe can settle this fight
Your squaw is on the warpath tonight
Well I've found out a big brave chief...
Yeah your squaw is on the warpath tonight
