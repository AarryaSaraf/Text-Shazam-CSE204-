Here I am a doing things I said I'd never do
But that's before my baby said we're through
It was on that tragic day the hurtin' got its start
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart
I've become a fallen girl for the love of a man
The same old thing goes on and on it's more than I can stand
To him it just don't matter but it's tearing me apart
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart

I spent my nights a crying while he was running round
My heart was the first place lonely found
I don't think I'll forget him I can't begin to start
That's how it is when lonely hits your heart
I've become a fallen girl...
