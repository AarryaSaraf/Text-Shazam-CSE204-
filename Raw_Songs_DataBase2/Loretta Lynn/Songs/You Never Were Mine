It's late almost morning you just walk in the door
Don't bother explaining I've heard it all before
Just turn around and leave me I've made up my mind
That I'll never lose you for you never were mine
I'll hurt if you leave me but I'll hurt if you'd stay
My heart knows no difference it would break either way
They all say I've lost you but someday they'll find
That I didn't lose you for you never were mine
I can't say that's over it never did start guess I lose my mind after losin' my heart
Oh no I'm not cryin' I've had too much wine
How can I lose you when you never were mine
Oh no I'm not cryin'...
