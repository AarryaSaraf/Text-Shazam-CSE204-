Your cheating heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do your cheating heart will tell on you

Your cheating heart will pine someday and crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue your cheating heart will tell on you
When tears come down...
