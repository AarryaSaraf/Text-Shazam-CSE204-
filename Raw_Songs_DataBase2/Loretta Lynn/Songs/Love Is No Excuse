Love is no excuse for what we're doing
For we both know that two hearts could break
We tell ourselves we've got to have each other
But love is no excuse for us to make.

Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else has got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day.

It's been going on for much too long now
And our wrongs have mounted one by one
We tell ourselves that's cause we love each other
But love is no excuse for what we've done.

Sure we love each other and it could be so right
But not if someone else has got to pay
Our love for each other looks good in the night
But our love can never see the light of day...
