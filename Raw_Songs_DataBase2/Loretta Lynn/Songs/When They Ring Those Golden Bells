There's a land beyond the river that we call the sweet forever
And we only reach that shore by fate you see
Yes I want to see my Jesus shake his hand and hear him greet us
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells a ringing can't you hear the angels singing
This glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far off sweet forever just beyond the shining river
When they ring those golden bells for you and me

When our days have known the number when in death we'll sweetly slumber
When the king commands the spirit to be free
There'll be no more stormy weather we'll live peacefully together
When they ring those golden bells for you and me
Don't you hear the bells a ringing...
