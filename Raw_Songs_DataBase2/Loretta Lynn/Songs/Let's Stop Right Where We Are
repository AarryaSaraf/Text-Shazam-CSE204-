I know you've had a change of heart the way you're on the range
But the love for you that's in my heart is something you can't change
When you get your field of green green grass stay home and you'll find clover
Let's stop right where we are and start all over.

Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's both admit that we've been wrong cry on each other's shoulder
Let's straighten up and save our love before we lose each other
Let's stop right where we are and start all over.

You don't love on me anymore the way you used to do
So I went out looking for the love I failed to get from you
I'd make believe that it was you the nights when I would hold her
Let's stop right where we are and start all over.

Let's stop right where we are and start all over
Let's both admit that we've been wrong cry on each other's shoulder
Let's straighten up and save our love before we lose each other
Let's stop right where we are and start all over.

Let's stop right where we are and start all over...
