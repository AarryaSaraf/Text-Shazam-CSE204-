Love's been here and gone but the mem'ry keeps holding on
Now I know how I'd be if I can leave through this love's been here and gone
When there's love your heart is strong but it weakens when love goes wrong
Now I've known that power dealt the parting hour love's been here and gone
I've loved once but never again a closed heart just won't let love in
Hopin' only to you oh what can I do love's been here and gone

I've loved once but never again...
