Here's the story of my life so listen and I'll tell it nice
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey
Well I was born in old Kentucky in them hills where folks are lucky
And it's paradise to me

Well the hogs are gruntin' and the roosters' a crowin'
Way back here in parts unknowin'
Pa's a milkin' and maw's a sweepin'
Brothers stand and you're asleep just too lazy to move

The kids are yellin' maw's got leven a way back here in paradise heaven
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey
The banjo's a goin' and so is the fiddle I think I'll just do a little
Of that ole hillbilly hoedown

Well I got a feller right over the hill
If he asks me to marry well I know I will
He asked me to marry got kissed before
And I'm tellin' you I don't want no more
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey

Well I got a feller right over the hill
If he asks me to marry well I know I will
He asked me to marry got kissed before
And I'm tellin' you I don't want no more
Yeah hey yeah hey yeah hey
