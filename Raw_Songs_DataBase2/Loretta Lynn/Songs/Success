We used to go out walkin' hand in hand you told me all the big things you had planned
It wasn't long till all your dreams came true success put me in second place with you
You have no time to love me anymore since fame and fortune knocked upon our door
Now I spend all my evenings all alone success has made a failure of our home

If we could share an evening now and then perhaps we'd find true happiness again
You never hold me like you used to do it's funny what success has done to you
You have no time to love me...
