You keep a sayin' you got something for me something you call love but confess yes
You've been a messin' where you shouldn't been a messin'
And now someone else is a gettin' all your best
These boots are made for walkin' and that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lyin' when you ought to be true then
And you keep loosin' when you ought enough bad
You keep a samin' when you oughta be a changin'
The what's right is right and you ain't been right yet
These boots are made for walkin'...

You keep a playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep a thinkin' that you'll never get burned
I've just found me a brand new box of matches yeah
And what he knows you ain't that time to learn
These boots are made for walkin'...
Come on boots let's walk all over
