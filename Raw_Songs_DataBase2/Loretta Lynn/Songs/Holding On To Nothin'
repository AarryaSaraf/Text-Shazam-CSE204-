We're holding on with nothin' left to hold on to
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times that we've been through
We've squeezed the life from every dream and still go on bluffin'
With really nothing left to hold on to

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other that's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to

We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long how hard we've tried

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold on to
Let's be honest with each other that's at least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to
We're holding on with nothing left to hold on to
