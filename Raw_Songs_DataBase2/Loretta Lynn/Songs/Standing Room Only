Standing room only not even room to kneel and pray
Standing room only on the Judgement Day
Last night I have an awful dream that the end of time had come
The trumpet had been sounded and life on earth has done
An angel stood one foot on land the other foot on sea
And as I tried to kneel and pray a voice said unto me
There's standing room only it's too late now to pray
There's standing room only this is the Judgement Day
People filled each church and churchyard just as far as I could see
I heard the pitiful cry for mercy and then I realized it was me
I saw the Saviour then appear as he split the eastern sky
I saw tears of joy on a Christian's face and I heard the sinners cry
And as I tried to touch his hand with one last people plea
I cried again have mercy have mercy Lord on me
I saw a tear come to his eye as he turned my soul away
I didn't know him yesterday and he knew me not today
The earth was burning all around the world wound up in smoke
And as the flames engulfed me thank God I awoke
Then I got out of bed and got down on my knees and you should've heard me pray
For in my dream I witnessed God's great Judgement Day
Standing room only on God's great Judgement Day
