I walked away from the wreck of our love affair
And no one knew how I was hurt because I lie
I walked away from the wreck but it broke my heart
And I'm off myself and broken inside
And when I see you with her I still wanna scream
It's like a bad bad dream that never seems to end
I walked away from the wreck of our love affair
But I'll never never be the same again

I saw the danger ahead but I paid no mind
For it seemed such harmless fun at the start
Too fights the crowd too much wine too much playing round
Then came the crash and my world fell apart
And when I see you...
