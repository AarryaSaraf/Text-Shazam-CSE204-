Someone before me still turns you inside out
When we're together she's all you talk about
You're always wanting me to do the things she used to do
Someone before me sure left her mark on you
I've tried to get inside your heart but I don't have a chance
Now I can see she's on your mind with every little glance
You're living on old mem'ries my love can't get through to you
Someone before me sure left her mark on you

I've tried to get inside your heart...
