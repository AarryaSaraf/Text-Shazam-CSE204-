I just can't get it through my head you love another now instead
Can't make myself believe we're really through
I'm walking up and down the hall talking to the silent wall
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
I think I've almost lost my mind I think about you all the time
I'm going crazy yes I know and I don't have far to go
The way you treat me is a shame but I'll keep loving you the same
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you

I keep your letters I should burn I wear your ring I should return
But there's a million foolish things I do
It makes me cry but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you
I think I've almost lost my mind...
