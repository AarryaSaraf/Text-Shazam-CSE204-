Just when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks all right again
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you dear
And to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall you have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer not knowing just where I stand
I know I shouldn't care but sweetheart it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win

And then when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks all right again
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win
Yeah sometimes you just can't win
