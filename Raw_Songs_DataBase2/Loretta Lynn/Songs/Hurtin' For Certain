Hurtin' for certain (certainly hurtin')

I'm right here hurtin' for certain
Cryin' for now you've walked out
Left me a wearin' my heart on my sleeve
Hurtin' for certain dyin' I know it's over
My knees started shakin' when my heart saw you achin' to leave

Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Ev'ryway I turn's a gonna be a wrong wrong way
Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
It looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay

I stand here hurtin' for certain
Our love has gone it's washed up
You'll see me sufferin' both night and day
Hurtin' for certain grievin' my heart is broken
The tears started comin' when my eyes saw you runnin' away

Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Ev'ryway I turn's a gonna be another wrong wrong way
Hurtin' for certain certainly hurtin'
Looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay
Yeah it looks like the blues have come around for a long long stay
