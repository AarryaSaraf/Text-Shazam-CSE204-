I'll help you get over your old love who'll help me get over you
I furnished the shoulder you cried on when she hurt you by turning you down
You still come to me when you're lonely I love you so I've stayed around
I'll help you get over your old love now my heart is breaking in two
I'll help you get over your lost love who'll help me get over you

Your heart keeps on searching for someone so I caught you when she let you fall
I've loved you so long now in silence but you'll never love me at all
I'll help you get over your heartbreak now my heart is breaking in two
Who'll help me get over my heartache who'll help me get over you
