(Where were you where were you)
Where were you when you left my heart alone
And the nights you didn't bother to come home
Now you say my love's grown cold I guess it's true
But when loneliness within where were you
Where were you when we lost the love we had
When I wanted you and needed you so bad
Now you're blaming me for things I didn't do
All the nights I spent a crying where were you
The lonely hours were just too much for me with only tears to keep me company
That's what destroyed the love that we once knew
Stop and think when it happened where were you

The lonely hours were just too much...
