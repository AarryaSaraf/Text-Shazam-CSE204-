You don't have to be a baby to cry all you need is for love to go wrong
You don't have to be a baby to cry or to lay awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
Then you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes why should I lie you don't have to be a baby to cry

When you leave me...
A little bitty baby you don't have to be a baby to cry
