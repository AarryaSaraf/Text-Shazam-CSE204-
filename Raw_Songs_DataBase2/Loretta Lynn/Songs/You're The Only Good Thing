Are you thinking that I don't care for you
Could it be you believe that I've been untrue
Oh listen sweetheart it just cannot be
For you're the only good thing that happened to me
We've had our ups and downs like all lovers do
But you know in your heart that I worship you
So don't ever think of setting me free
For you're the only good thing that happened to me

If you ever should think that I don't love you
That I'm not satisfied with the things that you do
I want you to know and please understand
There's nothing in this world worth the touch of your hand
We've had our ups and downs...
