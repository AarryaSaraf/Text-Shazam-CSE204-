Last night, I dreamed I took a walk up Cavalry's lonely hill
The things I saw with my own eyes could not have been more real

I saw up on three crosses, three men in agony
Two cried out for mercy, the third man looked at me
And oh the hurt in this man's eyes just broke my heart in two
It seemed that I could hear him say, "I'm doing this for you"
I knelt beneath the third man's cross and slowly bowed my head
I reached out to touch his feet and stained my hands with red
And when I heard him cry in pain, I raised my eyes to see
The blood spilled from the third man's side and some of it spilled on me
The third man wore a crown of thorns, spikes held him to the tree
I heard him say, "Oh God, my God, hast thou forsaken me?"
And there within the mighty crowd, the ones who mocked him cried
"King, save thyself if thy art King" and then the third man died
Suddenly, I heard the thunder roll, saw lightning pierce the sky
The third man was still hanging there and I began to cry
I saw the boulders fall and heard the breaking of the ground
Then I awoke and, though I'd dreamed, I touched my cheek and found

My eyes were wet where I had cried
A dream I wished I new
I still can hear the third man say
"I'm doing this for you"
