You say that I'm no angel oh I know it much too well
How can you look into my eyes and ask me why I failed
You know that I still love you and I let you drag me down
How can you talk about me when you've made me what I am
You've made me what I am but look who everybody blames
When you know you're the reason I hang my head in shame
Oh you tell me to forget you and to stop my hanging round
I'd be ashamed if I were you you've made me what I am

You never really loved me but I found that out too late
I've tried to find the way to change my love for you to hate
You act like you don't know me when there's someone else around
How can you hold your head up when you've made me what I am
You've made me what I am...
