Last night I dreamed about you and morning brought no change
I'll spend this whole day crying with that usual thing
Right now I can't remember the last time that I smiled
But I'll stop loving you when dreams go out of style
I know you think I'm crazy you don't feel the way I do
But still I'll keep on hoping that my dreams will come true
My heart won't let me give up my thoughts keep running wild
But I'll stop loving you when dreams go out of style

It's gotten so here lately I hear you call my name
Each night I wake up dreaming it's drivin' me insane
Friends tell me I'll get better but that will take awhile
I'll still be loving you when dreams go out of style
I'll still be loving you when dreams go out of style
