He could have caught ten thousand angels

They bound the hands of Jesus in the garden where he pray
They led him through the street in shame
They spat upon the Savior so pure and free from sin
They said crucify him he's to blame
He could have called ten thousand angels to destroy the world and set him free
He could have called ten thousand angels but he died alone for you and me

Upon his precious head they placed a crown of thorns
They laughed and said behold the king
They struck him and they cursed him and mocked his holy name
And all alone he suffered everything
He could have caught
