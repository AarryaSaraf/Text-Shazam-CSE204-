We're not kids anymore not a little girl and boy
But we break each other's heart like a child breaks a toy
We're a woman and a man watchin' love slip through our hands
Let's grow up we're not kids anymore

I go out of my way to hurt you more ev'ry day
And you cry like your little heart will break
And ev'ry time you make me blue I make a point to hurt you too
And I wonder how much more our love can take

We're not kids anymore not a little girl and boy
But we break each other's heart like a child breaks a toy
We're a woman and a man watchin' love slip through our hands
Let's grow up we're not kids anymore

We're not kids anymore not a little girl and boy
But we break each other's heart like a child breaks a toy
We're a woman and a man watchin' love slip through our hands
Let's grow up we're not kids anymore
Let's grow up we're not kids anymore
