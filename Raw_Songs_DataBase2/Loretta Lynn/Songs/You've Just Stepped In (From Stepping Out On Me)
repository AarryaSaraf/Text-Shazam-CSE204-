You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
And break that you've been on another spree
If you don't settle down and change your way
I'll wound up steppin' out on you someday
I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should
You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
You're not the faithful man I thought you'd be
Many nights I've wondered what you'd do if you caught me a steppin' out on you

I can't hold your love by force I wouldn't if I could
And I can't bring myself to leave though I know I should
You've just stepped in from steppin' out on me
I'll bet your conscience hurts you constantly
Oh time and time again you've been untrue so I'll just step in from steppin' out on you
