If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the treasures my pockets would hold
I'd be oh so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

An acre of diamonds I'd offered to you a solid gold mansion an airplane or two
This world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold

If teardrops were pennies...
