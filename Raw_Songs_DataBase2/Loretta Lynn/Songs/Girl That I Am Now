Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now
Tonight I'm in his arms but he just don't seem the same
I cheated and I'm guilty my heart is standing pain
I let passions fill my mind from my heart and conscience blind
I feel now mighty low and I pray he'll never know
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now

It almost breaks my heart when he says that he loves me
I know that I'm not worthy and that's what troubles me
If he do what I had done could he still feel just the same
I would be still the way I do guilty and ashamed
He love the girl I used to be could he love the girl that I am now
Mhm mhm mhm oh could he love the girl that I am now
