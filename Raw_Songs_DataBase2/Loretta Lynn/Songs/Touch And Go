The two hands of a clock are what we measure our love by
A moment stolen here and there to hold each other tight
They're suspicious and to linger would only make it grow
Our wedding rings and ties they bring make our love touch and go

The whispering talk of others is the price we have to pay
It wouldn't be so bad but then it's getting worse each day
And we'll surely hurt somebody cause they still love us so
It's borrowed time when love's this kind and our love's touch and go

Touch and go our separate ways until we meet again
Make up lies to satisfy the ones who ask us where we've been
But I'd rather have it this way than to never ever know
What true love is although our kiss is only touch and go

Touch and go our separate ways until we meet again
Make up lies to satisfy the ones who ask us where we've been
But I'd rather have it this way than to never ever know
What true love is although our kiss is only touch and go
