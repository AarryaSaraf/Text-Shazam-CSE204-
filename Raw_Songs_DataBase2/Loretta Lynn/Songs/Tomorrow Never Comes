Now you tell me that you love me yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married but tomorrow is never there
No tomorrow never comes no tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me but tomorrow never comes

Many weeks now I have waited many long nights I have cried
Just to see that happy morning when I'd have you by my side
But tomorrow never comes...
