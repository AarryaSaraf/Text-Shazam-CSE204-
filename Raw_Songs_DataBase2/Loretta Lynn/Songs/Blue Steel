Well I was feelin' mighty lonesome through my tears I could hardly see
When the flashin' lights of the honky tonk was inviting me
Oh well I sat down at my table with my head in my hand
And I watched him dance so close to her to the honky tonk band

It was then I heard the fiddle play the guitar it played too
And that old steel guitar it cried and it kept on playin' the blues

Oh well I ordered up just one more drink I thought would ease my mind
But I found out it didn't help for a love sick heart that's blind
Old memories keep comin' back old memories of you
And all the time that you once said that no one else would do

It was then I heard the fiddle play the guitar it played too
And that old steel guitar it cried and it kept on playin' the blues
