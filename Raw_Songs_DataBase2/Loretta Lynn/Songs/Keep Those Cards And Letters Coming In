Didn't want to be no soldier didn't want to leave your side
Didn't want to cross that ocean it's so deep and wide
I guess that I'm just bluest soldier in all Germany
But so I'm blue I'm gonna be true if you'll just write to me

Gotta keep those cards and letters coming in honey
Say you love me time and time again honey
It's many a miles from Nashville to Berlin honey
So keep those cards and letters coming in

You tell me that my letters killed you keep my lovin' on your mind
Keep your heart from everything and out of sweet frauleins
But every letter that you write honey I'll write free
Keep let me know you miss me so till you come home to me

Gotta keep those cards and letters...
So keep those cards and letters coming in
