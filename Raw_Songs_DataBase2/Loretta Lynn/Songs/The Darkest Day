Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Darlin' when you told me you were leavin'
I thought that you were only foolin' me
But here I am to face old blue tomorrow
With a broken heart that's filled with misery

It seems that my world is to an end
Just dreamin' of things that could have been
Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Oh how I wished that ole sayin' is true
It's always darkest just before dawn
And only God in heaven knows my heart is achin'
And only you can keep this heart of mine from breakin'

It seems that my world is to an end
Just dreamin' of things that could have been
Oh why don't that ole sun shine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life
