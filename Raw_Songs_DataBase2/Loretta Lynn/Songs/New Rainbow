There's a new rainbow in the sky
I can see the starlight in your eyes
Those love beams shine from cupid's bow
I'm in love with you I know

I've been searchin' all around to find someone like you
And now I'm gonna settle down I've found someone that's true
That rainbow will never fade away
For I know our love is here to stay

You put a rainbow in my heart
I know you won't tear it apart
And if you say you love me too
Then our dreams will all come true

I've been searchin' all around to find someone like you
And now I'm gonna settle down I've found someone that's true
That rainbow will never fade away
For I know our love is here to stay
