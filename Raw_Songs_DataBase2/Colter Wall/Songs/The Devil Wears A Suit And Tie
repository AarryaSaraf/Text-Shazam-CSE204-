Well
Reverend, reverend please come quick
'Cause I've got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks
Of Good Ole Miss
He drove a series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip

Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

And he said
I know you, I know you young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six-string picker
Just as I am
Let me learn you something
I know a few turns to make all the girls dance

Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

Oh
Foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons
Had a price, oh sweet price
My sweet soul, everlasting
A very own eternal light

Don't you know that the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
Well, the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
