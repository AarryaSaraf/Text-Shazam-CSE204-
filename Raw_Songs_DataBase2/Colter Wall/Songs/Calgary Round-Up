We're headed for the round-up, goin' to the big stampede
Old Dick Cosgrove's ridin' in the lead
Hear the rattlin' chuck wagon and the snortin' buckin' broncs
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede

Gather 'round the old chuck wagon, fix you up some grub
Flip those flapjacks over in the pan
Old Jim Ross, the cook he, boys he sure can toss 'em up
Well his chuck is good enough for any man

We're a jolly bunch of cowboys and we hope you are the same
We have no cares, the laws we seldom heed
Come gather in our circle and we'll sing this round-up song
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede

The guy who rode Old Steamboat, Jack Manley was his name
A better pal a cowpunch never knew
The way that hoss could toss a rope and take the lead in hand
When you're stuck he'd always see you through

We're a jolly bunch of cowboys and we hope you are the same
We have no cares, the laws we seldom heed
Come gather in our circle and we'll sing this round-up song
Headin' for the Calgary Stampede
Yes we're headin' for the Calgary Stampede
