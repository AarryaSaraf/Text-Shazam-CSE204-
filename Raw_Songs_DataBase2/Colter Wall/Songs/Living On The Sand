Leave them lights as they are
And keep your clothes on, I've had
More than my fill
Of whiskey and women
And good-hearted villains, but there's a
Wickedness in me still
Keep that gun locked away
Locked away boy
Well you know you're an angry young man
Going in town with six rounds
You're sure to be hell bound
That house you've got is built on the sand

I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promised land
On the sand

Don't look twice, look twice at that bottle
You'll claim that Jesus turned the water to wine
You'll be wishing that wine you were drinking was water
When you're jumping the bridge in the night
Forgive me, forgive me
Don't it sound more clear when I'm
Screaming day after day
I've lost all my patience
I'm wasted on waiting on
Making my next mistake

I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promised land
On the sand
I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promise land
On the sand
