The trains are gone, the trains are gone
Spent like the coal they once rolled on
The rails don't hum, the bows don't 
No brake-men yodelin' those rail yard songs

Granddad's ranch dried up fast
Ol' Johnny Chisum, he's seen to that
He's seen to that, matter of fact
Just as sure as Billy-boy got slain by Pat

I know I'm young, I know I'm young
I've seen too few a settin' sun
But the more I run the changes come
Swift as a freight train, the kind that's gone

The trains are gone, the trains are gone
Spent like the coal they once rolled on
