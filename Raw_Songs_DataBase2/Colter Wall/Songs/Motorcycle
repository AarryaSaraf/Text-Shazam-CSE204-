Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle

Well, I figure I'll walk to the liquor store
Thunderbird, two bottles
Maybe three, maybe four
Follow my feet down the Music Row

Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone

Well, I figure I'm weary of feeling this way
Pop another pill, hop another train
Tell my brothers and my sisters that it's keeping me sane
Figure I'm weary of feeling this way

Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
