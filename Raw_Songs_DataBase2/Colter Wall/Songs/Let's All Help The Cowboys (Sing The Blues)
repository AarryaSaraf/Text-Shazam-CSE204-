Cowboys they are ladies men alright
They can love 'em up and talk 'em up all night
But they're lonely when there's nothin' else to do
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

He does a little Waddie and he sings
He plays the mandolin and other things
He looks for love, beauty and IQ
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys have to fall in love, get hurt and all that bit
Let their hearts hang out, so they can write you all a hit
So ladies if they ask you don't refuse
Let's all help the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys they don't ever understand
This thing between a woman and a man
Until they love the one they always lose
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys have to fall in love, get hurt and all that bit
Let their hearts hang out, so they can write you all a hit
So ladies if they ask you don't refuse
Let's all help the cowboys sing the blues
