East of beautiful Alberta
North of old Montan'
The livings fine, when the springtime's kind
To a bovine raising man

Where they sort 'em, and stretch 'em, and tail 'em down
Like they did in days gone by
And good slab fence, and common sense
Are ne'er in short supply

Where the iron still hits the fire
And the rope's thrown straight and true
And they scorch their hides, till upon their sides
The brand is showing through

And the spring time turns with the coulee's curve
And it's summer once again
Whoopi ti yi yo, at the rodeo
And we pray our buddies win

It's Western swing and waltzes
Like to wear out your boots
It's horsehair floors, and Louis L'Amour
After they close the chutes
When they've rode up all the rank ones
And the chucks are out of sight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight

It's Western swing and waltzes
Like to wear out your boots
It's horsehair floors, and Louis L'Amour
After they close the chutes
When they've rode up all the rank ones
And the chucks are out of sight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight
