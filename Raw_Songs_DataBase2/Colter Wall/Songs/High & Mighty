Tom Taylor's colt from Candiac
Has made his marks in cowboy tracks
Buckin' down the best at Calgary
A pet stud colt that liked to buck
Changing lots of cowboy luck
Snapping high and hard and wild and free

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's High and Mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

Three years spent sent out bareback
Trailed and rodeoed in the slack
Till Brown and West put a saddle on one day
It lit the fuse for down the road
From the chute now he'll explode
Let the cowboys scatter where they may

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's High and Mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

He's hot-branded one-oh-eight
Pull down your hat and throw the gate
Brown and West's six year old's the best
He can take you through the door or he can put you on the floor
High and mighty of the golden west

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's high and mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride
