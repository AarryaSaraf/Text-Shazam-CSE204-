Well I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away
Dixieland

Oh musket and cannon have torn his gray coat
Don't he look fine and handsome
Don't he look at his most
45 in the foxhole and at this I will boast
Don't they look fine and handsome
My poor Johnny Boy's Bones

Well who will bring back my Johnny Boy's Bones
To lay beneath the trees of his Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

Well he died for his country
And he died for his kin
And he died killing men
A most honorable sin
But them mean boys in blue
They done turned him in
When they laid him low
With a laugh and a grin

Well who will bring back my Johnny Boy's Bones
To lay beneath the trees of his Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed
