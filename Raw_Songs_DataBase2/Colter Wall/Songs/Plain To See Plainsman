I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade
The icy depths of the Pacific I have bade
Forever I wander, forever I stray
The rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name
Callin' my name

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home

Well the North-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold
The South has filled up both my belly and soul
I know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old
These bones will cry out for the place they were born
Place they were born

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home

I've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see
Road-bitten bikers and barefoot hippies
Junkies and saints on my travels I greet
But far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me
Plainsmen like me

Let me die in the country that I love the most
I'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast
A heart that lies far from the East or West Coast
This plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home
Longin' for home
