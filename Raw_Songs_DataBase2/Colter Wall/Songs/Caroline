There's a place where the sun doth shine
And the birds keep time with the pines up yonder
That's the home of my Caroline
She's dancing in the sky

Oh, how sweet when we meet
On the golden streets of the great wide valley
These old chains around my feet
They're pulling me back down

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

And my bones do break and my hands do shake
As I lie in the wake of time's cruel slaughter
But if I die before I wake
I'm gonna see my Caroline

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

There's a place where the sun doth shine
And the birds keep time with the pines up yonder
That's the home of my Caroline
She's dancing in the sky

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

Caroline, my Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name is next to mine
