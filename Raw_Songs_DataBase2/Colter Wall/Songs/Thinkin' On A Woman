Sweetly takin' his time
Drinkin' on a straight rye
Chasin' it with red wine
Heavy on his troubled mind
Sweetly takin' his time
Tryin' to make it all right
Thinkin' on that woman
Thinkin' on that woman

He's tunin' up the CB
"Can anybody hear me?"
"'Cause I'm headin' down the Number 3
"I got deadlines to meet"
Tunin' up his CB
Hopin' it will free me
Thinkin' on a woman
Thinkin' on that woman

He's been singin' sad songs
Thinkin' how she's long gone
He's treatin' those that love him wrong
He's ornery as the night is long
He's been singin' sad songs
Thinkin' how she's long gone
Thinkin' on that woman
Thinkin' on that woman

Burnin' up the midnight oil
Special brand of big-rig toil
It's enough to make your blood boil
These mountain roads'll prove my foil
Burnin' up the midnight oil
Gonna shuffle off this mortal coil
Thinkin' on a woman
Thinkin' on a woman
