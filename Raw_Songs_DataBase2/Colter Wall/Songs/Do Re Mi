Lots of folks back east they say
Leavin' home every day
Beatin' the hot ol' dusty way of the California life

Crossin' the desert sands they rode
Gotta get out of that ol' dust bowl
Think they're goin' to a sugarbowl
But here's what they find

Now the police at the board of entry say
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"
If you ain't got Do Re Mi, boy
You ain't got Do Re Mi

You better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee

California is a garden of Eden
She's a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you will find it's so hot
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi

Well you wanna buy a house or farm
That can't do nobody no harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea

Don't swap your old cow for a car
You're better off stayin' right where you are
Better take this little tip from me

As I look through the wanads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say
"If you ain't got Do Re Mi, boy"
"You ain't got Do Re Mi"

You better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee

California is a garden of Eden
She's a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you will find it's so hot
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi
