While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of hope and dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me, are we meant to be?

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time (time, time)
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial

Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
(Lights go down today)
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
(And I can't stand the pain)

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing

Don't you beg me for forgiveness
Don't mistake my love for weakness

Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing

(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
(Ooh, ooh)
All or nothing
