Baby, you should leave this girl alone
But you won't, won't, won't
But you don't, don't, don't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you won't, won't, won't
You gotta go, go, go
Oh my, my, my
Gonna spill it right out

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more
I'm just telling it like it is

Boy, man up
You're not some animal
No, no, no
No, no, no
Rather die a thousand times tonight
Than take you home
Than take you home
These walls I build, they're never coming down

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more
I'm just telling it like it is

I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is
I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is, I tell it like it is

I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more
I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don't feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don't need you to say those words no more
I'm just telling it like it is
