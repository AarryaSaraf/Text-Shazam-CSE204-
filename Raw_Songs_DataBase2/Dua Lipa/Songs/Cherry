Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad
Real, real sad
Che-che-che-che-cherry

Can you tell me how this happen?
'Cause I'm goin' insane
I thought we were everlastin'
How did it get this way, yeah yeah yeah?
You knew that this shit would hurt me
You cause my heart to break
You pulled this stunt a million times
But never quite this way

How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame?
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back
Gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you

Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha!)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad (Ooh)
Real, real sad (Ooh))
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha!)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that (Ooh)
He never came back (Ooh)
Che-che-che-che-cherry

I am not the one to tell you
How to live your life
But you can have my sloppy seconds
Keepin' mine alright

How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame?
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back
Gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you

Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha!)
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad (Ooh)
Real, real sad (Ooh)
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha!)
Cherry, you just took him by the hand
Now he's never ever comin' back
Just like that (Ooh)
He never came back (Ooh)
Che-che-che-che-cherry

Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Che-che-che-che-cherry (Ha!)
