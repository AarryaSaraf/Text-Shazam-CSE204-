Moving too fast, they say it won't last
But I just wanna, yeah, I just wanna see for myself
The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
'Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna, ooh

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we've been here before
'Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret

Let me savor all your flavours
And I don't wanna, yeah, I don't wanna share with no one
Feel them watchin', but we ain't talkin'
Boy, I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna, ooh

I've been waiting for you
Been waiting for me
A familiar feeling between us
Like we've been here before
'Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret

One day we can tell 'em all
We can tell 'em how
We can tell 'em when
We can tell 'em why
But for now, let's keep it secret
One day we can reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now, let's keep it secret

We don't have to say that we're lovers
Even though we're touchin' each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
'Cause I wanna keep it
Somewhere where nobody can chime in
We can let 'em know when the time is right, ooh
For now, let's keep it secret
