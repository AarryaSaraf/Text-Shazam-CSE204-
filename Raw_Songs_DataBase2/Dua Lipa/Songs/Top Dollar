Diamonds leave me frozen cold
By now you should know me better (better)
I would rather spend your time
I don't need these hollow treasures

Look at me now
Look at me like you (ooh)
You don't really care, you (ooh)
I want you there, you (ooh)
If you don't listen, man

You gotta go, if you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)

Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money
'Cause I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money
But I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)

Even when I fall asleep
I believe in simple pleasures
Maybe we're not meant to be
'Cause I don't need these precious metals

Look at me now
Look at me like you (ooh)
You don't really care, you (ooh)
I want you there, you (ooh)
If you don't listen, man

You gotta go, if you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)

Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money
'Cause I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money
But I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)

(I'm your top, top dollar)
Look at me now
Look at me like you (ooh)
You don't really care, you (ooh)
I want you there, you (ooh)
If you don't listen, man

You gotta go, if you still don't know
That my love is your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Rollies and gold
No, they don't come close to my love
I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)

Hey, you
No, you can't afford to lose me
You can't buy my money
'Cause I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
Hey, you
You should know a thing about me
You can stack your money
But I'm your top, top dollar (ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
