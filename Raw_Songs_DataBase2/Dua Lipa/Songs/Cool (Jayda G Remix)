Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Ah-ah)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite-tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool

Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you

Hey, go
