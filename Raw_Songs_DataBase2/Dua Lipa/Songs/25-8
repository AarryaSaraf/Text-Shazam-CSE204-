My friends are calling, since the morning
They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin', but the only thing missin' is my clothes, my clothes

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8

Calling insomnia, but this is just the thing that I like
'Cause when you're on me, I get hungry, got a big appetite
Wanna feel the rush, runnin' through my blood
Baby, don't open the blinds, all night

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

I gon' need all the extra hours
You and me all up in this room
You gon' need all the extra powers
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom

We gon' need all the extra hours
To do the things I want to do
We gon' need all the extra powers
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom, zoom)

Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you and you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
Gon' never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
