Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

Ahh
Mmm
Hey, ah

I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

Ahh
That's what makes us good in bed
Hey, ahh

Sometimes I think about you, you know?
I can't get you out of my mind
It's like an addiction
I can't stop
I love you

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
