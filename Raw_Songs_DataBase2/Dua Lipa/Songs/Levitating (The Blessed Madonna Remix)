If you wanna run away with me
I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
No, we're never gonna be apart

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Can't stop it, baby) let's go!

Boy, I'm advanced, got my real tight pants
When I back it up I put you in a trance
If you wanna dance then show me all your bands
'Cause tonight I might give you that chance
(Let's get it, skrrt) Pull up in the coupe
Ooh, that dude, he look hella cute
Yeah, he looking at me like, ooh
Say my breasts like Betty Boop
Oh my, my, my
Get to sweltering like ay-ay-ay
I'm a freak, I like to play shy
But I will get it poppin', anything I'll try it
Say I'm on his top five list
On a Major Key like Kylie
Don't speak, open up your eyelids
(I can be your girl if you keep it private)

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
(Come on, dance with me)

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

Come on, come on, come on dance with me

Come on, come on, come on dance with me
