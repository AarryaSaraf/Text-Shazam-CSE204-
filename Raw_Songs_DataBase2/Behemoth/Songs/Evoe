Harken the laments ov the martyrs
The very music ov Thy name
Thou art the beginning and the end
Alpha and Omega
The creation and remains

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence

Thou art the asymmetry to the covenant divine
The magnet bonding black with white
Thou art unanswered "what" and "why"
Ignited passions and the longing in the prophet's eye

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence

I call upon Thee
Hermits ov the Earth

Pater Ecstaticus - come forth!
Pater Profundus - come forth!
Pater Seraphicus - come forth!
Come to reclaim the throne!

I sing my song to Thee
O planetary soul
In rapture I shall burn
To worship the unknown

Asomateous one!
Thou art the prologue ov the sun
Thou were there ere day was born
Mephistopheles!
Thou shine unending aeons hence
Redeemed malevolence
