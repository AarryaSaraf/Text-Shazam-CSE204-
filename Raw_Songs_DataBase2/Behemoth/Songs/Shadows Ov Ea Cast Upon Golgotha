Am I the only one who beholding the sunrise?
In the ganglion ov deathless nights?
Drought I became, for all those at the bottom
As I shed lion's skin off my back
Into dismal deserts I crawl
To sustain my pilgrimage on Earth
Within your blood I submerge, my Lord
Within your blood I am drenched

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters surround
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters surround
Fire flows inwards

No words can voice the poetry ov my wrath
No foe dares to challenge my fury
My legions crushed, yet they speak my names
A pale halo casting shades ov disgrace
With blood ov the lamb I shall seal this pact
Amidst the sun and the moon
I am the spear ov Longinus
I am the arrows ov doom

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Ea turns inwards

Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Aether above
Black Earth below
Waters around
Ea turns inwards
