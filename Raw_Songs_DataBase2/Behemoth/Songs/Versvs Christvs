He, who is
From another light
He is the bellow
Ov a shooting star

He who impels
Frenzied storms to cease
Behold, Qasidah
For our lord Iblis

I've sworn to be a channeler ov thy rays
I have succumbed like a moth to the flame
For my legions demur to submit
I am thy devotee, o lord in the abysmal pit

Sever the tongue
Ov Cicero
Gauge out
Copernicus' eyes

Stone Shakespeare
For the heresy ov his scrawl
Undo the surge
Mar the tide

Wingless
With feet upon the horizon
Let's rise at morn
Herald the Sun
Render unto Caeser
The things that are Caesar's
Deliver man all spoils ov the divine

Magnificamvs te
Versvs Christvs
Tibi deo satanae

Confuse, we shall live in tongues
Devitalize the populist mandates
O demagogues ov miserable worth
No seed will bloom upon mother Earth

No grain will  blossom in the daylight
The Sun shall perish, turning cold
And when the desert typhoon smother final gospel
Rise up, thou wicked
And blow the doomsday horn

Wingless
With feet upon the horizon
Let's rise at morning
To herald the Sun

Gebt dem Kaiser
Was des Kaisers ist
Deliver man all spoils ov the divine

Magnificamvs te
Versvs Christvs
Regnamvs tibi lvcem ferre
Tibi deo avrorae

He, once banished, forever shall return
He, once fallen shall rise again
And at the hour ov our death
The infinite
He shall remain

He, once banished, forever shall return
He, once fallen shall rise again
And at the hour ov our death
The infinite
He shall remain
