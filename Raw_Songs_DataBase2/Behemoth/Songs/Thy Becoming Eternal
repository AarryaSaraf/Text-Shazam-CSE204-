O blest be thou, as vast as the night
(In nomine igni)
Thou who dost spawn the infernal and divine
(In odivm fidei)
O blest be thou, as bright as light
(In absentia christi)
Armadas ov rebellion align

I shall bathe myself in wine and gold
I will tear the arteries ov cosmos so it may bleed
Behold the malignant salvo ov my crimes
Abysmal eons that have wandered by
Where would I seek the truth but here
Where mutiny and chaos bloom?

I satiate the ferocious hunger ov the beast
(In nomine igni)
Cast the flock in great fury upon the Earth
(In odivm fidei)
From South to North, from West to East
(In absentia christi)
In unity my fleets traverse

I shall cause thine overwhelming hatred to consume
Among the sainted legions where black hearts ignite
Forsooth, the branches ov this wretched tree I'll wound
And rob its pestilential scions ov their lives
Where should I seek the truth but here
Where mutiny and chaos bloom?

Be praised
O be glorified
Exalted, honoured and lionised
Breathe in and breathe out
Cleansing fire from within and from above
Thy becoming is eternal
The thrusting spear disinheriting the meek
By the name ov the borneless one
We hail Satan
We hail thee
