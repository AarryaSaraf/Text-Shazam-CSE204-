Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me

Here with him a little ways from now, empty
Everything we ever was was empty
Empty fucking, cussing, I know I'm your bitch
Be on my bitch too making money little TM
DM your resume to industry
Sympathy held you down, don't doubt, we love you
Ain't nobody around, ask away like I'm empty
Empathy was empathy only when you was into me
Kiss me back to save your happy, happy
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
Laffy taffy, daffy ducky, fucky all around
Fuck me on the ground, fuck me in the bed too
Skip, love me with your eyes closed, cigarette, cruise ship
This song ain't even about you, Daffy Duck
This song gon make me fuck your daddy
This song the reason I be claiming 'fore I send him the addy
This like a remedy for nothing, this me frenchin' a tabby

Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me
Me so happy now, me so Mississippi
Kiss me 'til I drown, everybody think they know me
Don't nobody really know me


Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth

I know you never love me but I fucked you anyway
I guess a bitch like to gamble, I guess a bitch like to lonely
Who niggas? No me, me, God atone me
Oh I'm really feeling like I made this bitch
I know that's my ego, I know I'm just empty the sentiment for the people
The sacrifice for my hoes, I'm gonna rob the church for the steeple
I bought you Game 5 tickets, made my pussy the sequel
So you really don't think about me?
And you really don't miss me?
Though I lullaby your brokenness, believe me i'm Ripley
But you struggling to love yourself, believe me that's karma
You want a nasty bitch, psychiatrist that cook like your mama
And all you got was me-me-me
But I love even though we're not meant to be, I still love you
I hope you find everything that you want, and she loves you
Everything is everything just know that I love you


Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
Don't doubt your wealth
Quit looking out the window
Go find yourself
Go on and get the bag with your kinfolk
