Interview, interlude in the nude with my boo thang
Got the flu with the tea remedy for my boo thang
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
I swear he love me
My tummy almost got ready
For biddi-baby spaghetti
And teddy bear in my window now
Golden child, always smile
Before you leave, don't look down
God will help you spread your wings

My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey

Ask me why she said goodbye
Why baby dyin' white walls
Cigarette's over skyfall
Writing this life, this my song
Ask me why she hesitated
Almost waited, waiting room
Play date up to heaven soon
Soon I will see the King
He reminds me
Some give presents before they're even ready
I could see that she loves me
I know her heart is heavy

Telefone-ication nation
Baby help me testify
Oooh you know I hate goodbye
Bye bye blue
Somebody let the yellow end
Bye bye blue
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
You my baby, you my baby
I'm your baby, I'm your baby
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
I'm gonna fall in love again
On a lonely road where happiness needs us
