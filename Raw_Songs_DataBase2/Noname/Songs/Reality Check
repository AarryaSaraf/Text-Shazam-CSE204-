Opportunity knockin
A nigga was out for coffee
Inadequate like my window
The Grammy's is way too lofty
And I could stay here forever
I could die here
I don't have to try here
Can I get my two sugars please?
Jesus made an album
I'm still waiting in the line for cream
She dream in techni-color
Live black and white
Opportunity knockin
A nigga just got her nails done
Skeletons in my closet gone open the door when Yale come
They ain't gonna wanna see my silhouette rap
He's fucking cognac
My smile in all black
Mississippi vagabond
Granny gone turn up in her grave
And say, my granny really was a slave for this
All your uncompleted similes and pages ripped
You know they whipped us niggas
How you afraid to rap it
You went to heaven after so we could free them now
Ain't no ocean floor when you can be a yeezus now


Don't fear the light
That dwells deep within
You are powerful
Beyond what you imagine
Just let your light glow


Seventeen moments and cloudy days on my snap
Mysterious aberration, illuminated the trap
My telefone-calications synonymous with the sunrise
Mountains against the foreground forever me coming back
I ain't gonna cry
The last time Ali marched Chicago
Twenty four and a late mojo teaching me how to drive
Whole world inside my rear view
This feel in me so alive
This feel in me so alive
Enjoy the joyride
Opportunity knockin'
It's finally time to answer
The doorbell was only broken cause auntie was fighting cancer
Cigarettes on my mantle keep callin me by my first name
Loving me when I'm lonely
Pretending they really Noname


Don't fear the light
That dwells deep within
You are powerful
Beyond what you imagine
Just let your light glow


And when that call comes
(You better)
You better say hello
No hesitation
(you better)
No hiding, deep down below
(you better)
No beg your pardon
(you better)
You better stay and grow
Your liberation
(you better)
For your lonely soul
You'll be on your own
