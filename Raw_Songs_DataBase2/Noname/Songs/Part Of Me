I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave


Riddle me this, Mona Lisa piece of pepperoni
Smilin over phony speakers, gettin a fit off-ten
Offa the shits, it's a party at my granny house
Now birthdays and funerals will only bring the family out
Riddle me new, politician do a dance for me
Hot potato, milly rock, devastation of kiddy bop
Idiot, itty bitty resentfulness
Riddle me gone, Chicago go go bye
Chicago East roam savage
Ashes for backstage passes
Ashes to house on Ashland
Chicago go go Kobe
Move to LA county
But all my old life there
But all my new life there
Riddle me, Lord. forgive me


I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave


Shaking the dust off my heel as I get infected
Weekend trips to my aunties was an antiseptic
The fat boy anorexic ain't admit
Cause my complexion rich like an Etch a Sketch
I'm sculpting the pain in em like ammonia Lewis
My notebooks less Jesus, more gospel to it
Let's holler and hoop and my niggas is stupid, my niggas is shooting
Your interpretation of that last bar will tell me where you was rooted
Me and mines amongst the 
I'm talking moonshine, night walkin', underground, high stakin'
Cop'll put the choppa on ya, make the pupils dilate
Oh what a drug is fear, oh what a love is close
Oh at the crib with the coupe deville with the overdose that made jealousy dance on the crowd
I been everywhere, everywhere let me down
Worn every hat every hat with a crown
Now every head bowed, dear God


I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
I have to focus on the part of me that I'm trying to feed
I can't pretend I'm not myself
But if you go wipe your shoes before you leave
