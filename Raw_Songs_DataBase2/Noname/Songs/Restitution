Baby, am I enough for you?
Baby, am I in love? Or is it tomorrow
I left my window all open
And you were hoping to borrow my time
I don't want you, I don't want you
A kiss goodnight was all I needed
A kiss goodbye was all I needed
Like you were my forever, ever, ever
My pretty baby, everything

I'm not a sinner, I just crush a lot
I can't call my kettle dark 'cause after dark, we fuck a lot
Kingdom come and crown me happy, Laffy Taffy, inner thot
This bitch will always ride for you, ride for you
You silly if you believe me, believe me, yeah, if I need be
Skinny like you like it, fake titties
On lovers island, take a dip in my river

You can keep your cup of water
Though I'm thirsty, I can't take it no more
I need some restitution, mercy on your soul
I'm letting you go
