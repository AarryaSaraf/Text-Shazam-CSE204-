If you wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me later
Gentrify all my people, there's heaviness on the table
If you wanna help me to put me inside the cusp
Put the cigarette inside my back
Keep the hospitals over run-run-run-run chicken little
How my city gonna run off shits and giggles?
Politicians overzealous with the provolone
 and incidentals, they crashed the rental with God and temple, and bible
Don't nobody got no holy
Everybody got an iPhone
If wanna help me then kiss me and fuck me good-good-good tonight
Inglewood tonight
LA be bright but still a dark city
So come get your happy and your new titties
Go find your doctor, you can get Kimmy sorta how we used to love you


America the great
It's Grateful Dead and life for me
Apple pie on Sunday morning
Obesity and heart disease
Can you hear the freedom bells?
Can you see the rusty nails chipping away out on the coffin?
Approach with caution, hallelujah, amen, amen
I was lost but thinking I was truly free (amen, amen)
Darkness lingers in the wake of slavery (amen, amen)
Hold me close, don't let me fall into the deep (amen, amen)
The lost have risen, a new religion, hallelujah, amen, amen

Demons behind your back will call you crack bitch
I seen myself all on the dash, could've sworn it's a gun
I ain't seen a toddler in the back after firing seven shots
A demon about to get me, he watching me kill his mom
 is overflooded, these niggas is on the rise
Bake a cake with flour its battered and gentrified
Why oh why my dick getting bigger
This violence turn me on me on
My mama finally see my baby on Channel 2
She love me better when I be keeping them streets clean
Why oh why my house getting bigger, corruption
Turn me on
Ain't no police locking up these niggas better than me
And my wife think I look like a man, I feel manly
And I tell Stanley, when you grow be like you dad
A free man in the land of the noose
They ain't tell me how to crouch and shoot
I did, they only told me how to check her pulse, she dead
When I win it's like confessional, trying to find me a therapist
They taught me how to say amen
Amen
