Fee-fi-fo, cigarillo, cigarillo
I'm shaking up with the trees, how I keep the leaf in the middle
I'm more than these hotel rentals and dental bills adding up
I'm the Kennedys out for lunch with a preacher, martyr the king
I'm Cardi's engagement ring, I'm America showing off
I'm Viacom, Viacom, I'm Chappelle in Pelle Pelle
And rapping like Dyalan, spell it like Dylan
Gave my body to Adam, he told to lie for him
Apple wasn't the apple, the truest sin was the pussy
I'm patriarchy on Sunday, don't push me, I'm Viacom
Y'all niggas got Diddy money, don't push me, I'm atom bomb
I'm Obama pushing the button, in Lybia, Pakistan
Humanly a hypocrite, the sinner and the civilian
The pettiest that gets, I'm America at its best
Yeah, I'm America at its best
Boom boom, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Started getting money from writing the haiku
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Everybody on me, I'm lookin' just like you
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
If you smoking dope, then your shorty can come too
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay

Riddle me happy, I'm lonely, hysteria
A lone gunman outside the parking lot, Missus America
I'm everything that you're not, like Kendrick before his prime
I'm the ticking inside his watch, and an underdog you forgot
Got privilege and money
Part of me buried in the earth, part of me chasin' more money
Parted with artificial trappings, y'all can't take nothing from me
I'm going dummy for dummy
If all my godliness is measured by the way that y'all love me, I'm free

Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Started getting money from writing the haiku
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Everybody on me, I'm lookin' just like you
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
If you smoking dope, then your shorty can come too
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay, with the Noname
Yippee-ki, yippee-ki-yay

Haiku
Like you, like you
No, no, come too
