Your family looking like a prison
Your momma at the table cryin
All her hair gone
Feeling fishy Finding Chemo
Smoking seaweed for calm
This Disney movie's too close
He told 'em, emo Noname thank you for your sweet Telefone
It saves lives
The secret is I'm actually broken
I tried to raise a healer kneeling at the edge of the ocean
Somebody, somebody said it saves lives
Who holds my hand at night? I think the glass half full
Who brought me back to Inglewood, I shouldn't bleed this good Holy conundrum
I'ma pray to hope the bank account wishin' both of my loved ones
Tell 'em Noname still don't got no money
Tell 'em Noname almost passed out drinking
Secret is, she really think it saves lives
Somebody hit D'Angelo, I think I need him on this one
Brothers and sisters, mommas, cousins, uncles, everyone
Missing somebody
Dancing daylight

I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my daddy don't forget about me

Let's get down to the nitty gritty, changed my city
Titties 13k, pretty costs these days
Doctor really love me, I'm only half awake
I just came from the funeral, my ugly passed away
Welcome to Beverly Hills
Welcome to Vicodin, I took the pills
I think they save lives
I just hope that they pray
All I am is everything and nothing at all
All I am is shoulder for your heart to lean on
All I am is love, all I am is love

I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
I know everyone goes some day
I know my body's fragile, know it's made from clay
But if I have to go, I pray my soul is still eternal
And my momma don't forget about me
I pray my momma don't forget about me
I pray my granny don't forget about me
