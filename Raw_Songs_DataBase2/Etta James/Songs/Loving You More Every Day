I'm lovin' you more, more, more now
Lovin' you more every day, oh yes I am
I'm lovin' you more, sho' 'nuff now, in every way now-ow-ow-ow-ow

Oh, you got me so I can't eat, got me so I can't sleep a wink
Everybody gonna start talkin', askin' what are you, what are you doin' to me?
I tell 'em you're makin' me love you more, more, more, more now
Oh, lovin' you more every day, oh yes I do

I said, I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Oh, not only on weekends, I wanna love you every day, oh yes I do
And not just for a boyfriend, oh
I want you to marry me and take me home to stay

And if I get you, I'm gonna have a full time job
I'm gonna work hard all day
'Cause when you come home, when you come home to me, little boy
I know, I know, I know I'm gonna get my way
For lovin' you more, more, more, more, more
More every day

Yeah, and if I get you, if I get you, I'm gonna treat you right
I'm gonna love you day and night
And if you argue and if you fuss at me
All I want to do is just squeeze you tight and keep on lovin' you
More, more, more, more, mmm every day
