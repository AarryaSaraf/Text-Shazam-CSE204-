Nobody loves me
No, nobody cares
When I call you, baby
You're never there
And sometimes I feel
No more can I bear
For my love
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody, nobody cares
Nobody cares

When I'm in despair
Nobody cares
If I'm pulling out my hair
And sometimes I feel
No more can I bear
This pain is too much, too much for me to stand
Nobody cares
(Nobody cares)
Oooh, nobody cares
(Nobody cares)
Nobody
No
Nobody cares, no

Sometimes I feel
I feel
No more can I bear
For my love
My love
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody cares
Nobody cares
(Nobody cares)

When I'm, when I'm in despair
(Nobody cares)
You know and I know that nobody cares
When I pull out my hair
Nobody
Nobody
(Nobody cares)
Nobody
Nobody
