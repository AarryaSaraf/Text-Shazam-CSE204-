Come on, come on

Hang it in baby, hang it in right now
Hang it out honey, everybody work out

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Better watch your step baby, don't step on the banana peel
If you put your little head in now honey, I'll go up to the ceiling

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Shotgun, shoot him 'fore he run now
Freak it pretty baby, free it right now

Sookie, sookie
Sock it, sock it, sock it, sock it, sock it
Sock it, sock it, sock it, sock it, sock it

You got it bad child, drink a bottle of turpentine
When you wake up in the morning baby, you'll be feelin' kinda fine

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue

Hang it out baby yeah, hang it out baby yeah
Hang it in baby, hang it out baby yeah
Hang it in baby, now hang it out honey
Hang it in baby yeah, hang it out baby

Sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sookie, sue
