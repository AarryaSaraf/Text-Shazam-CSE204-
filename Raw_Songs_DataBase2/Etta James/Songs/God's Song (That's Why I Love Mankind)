Cain slew Abel, Seth knew not why
For if the children of Israel were to multiply
Why must any of the children, why must they die?
So he asked the Lord, and the Lord said:
Man means nothing, he means less to me
Than the lowliest cactus flower or the humblest yucca tree
Chases 'round the desert
'Cause he thinks that's where I'll be
And uh, that's why I love mankind
I recoil in horror from the foulness of Thee
Oh, from the squalor and the filth and the misery
How we laugh up here in Heaven at the prayers you offer me
And that's why I love mankind
Oh, oh

The Christians and the Jews were having a jamboree, yeah
The Buddhists and the Hindus
The Buddhists and the Hindus joined in on satellite TV
They picked their four greatest priests
And they began to speak
And they said: "Lord, a plague is on the world (Oh)
Lord, no man is free (Oh)
The temples that we built to you (Oh)
Have tumbled down, fell into the sea" (Oh)
Lord, if you won't take care of us
Please, please let us be?
And the Lord said (The Lord said)
And the Lord said (And the Lord said)
He said:
I burn down your cities, how blind you must be, ha
I take you, your children, and say how blessed are we
Now you must all be crazy to put your faith in me

And that's why I love mankind
You really need me
That's why I love, I love mankind
