Be honest with me dear, whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Where ever you wander, on land or on sea
If you really love me, you'd be honest with me

My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear, I'll dream about you
For you are my darling, you're all that I see
If you really love me, you'd be honest with me

Someday I'll return dear and make you, make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
I'll never forget you and your sweet memory
If you really love me, be honest, be honest with me
