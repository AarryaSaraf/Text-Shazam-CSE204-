In America you get food to eat
Won't have to run through the jungle and scuff up your feet
No, you just sing about Jesus and drink wine all day
It's great to be an American

Ain't no lions or tigers, ain't no mamba snakes
Just the sweet watermelon and the buckwheat cake
Everybody is happy as a man, as a man can be
Climb aboard, little wog, sail away with me

Now c'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

In America every man is free
To take care of his home and his family
You'll be as happy as a monkey in a monkey tree
You're all gonna be an, an American

Now c'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
C'mon and sail away, sail away
We will cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

Sail away, sail away, sail away
We will cross Charleston Bay
Now sail away, sail away, sail away
We gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay

Sail away, sail away
We gonna cross the mighty ocean into the Charleston Bay
Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away
We gonna cross it, we gonna cross that bay
Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away, sail, sail
