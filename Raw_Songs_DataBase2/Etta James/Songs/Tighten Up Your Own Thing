Oh, ooh hoohoo, ah ah, ah!

Stop talking about Mr. Charlie!
He ain't nothin' but a man
I want you to stop preachin' hate, brother
Go out and shake a few hands
Oh, Got everything you need, yeah
To make your life really swing
All you gotta do is

Tighten up your own thing, baby
Tighten up your own thing, yeah
Tighten up!
Your own thing

Let wisdom be your hammer
Let progress be your aim
You're bound to hit it big one day, brother
Freedom will be your claim
Oh, you gotta stop drawing lines
Start pulling strings
All you need to do is

Tighten up your own thing, babe
Tighten up your own thing
Oh! Tighten up! Oohoo! Hoo...

Oh! Ooh hoo!

Now, people ain't nothing but flesh and blood, now
And thats all there is to that!
Let me tell you, flesh and blood don't make em bad, no, no
Its the way they live and act
Now listen, you're not in the dark no more!
You've got your civil rights!
All you need to do is

Tighten up your own thing, baby
Tighten up your own thing
Oh, tighten up!
Get together!
Tighten up!
Pull it tighter, now!
Stop segregating!
Do some integrating!
Pull it together, now!
Be brothers and sisters, yeah
All men together now!
Stop fighting, killing one another, now
Get it together!
Oh, tighten up!
