When you went away I cried for so long
I wanted you to stay but that was all wrong
The pain you left my behind has become a part of me
And it's burned that hole where my love used to be

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

And I know, I know I love you but that wasn't good enough
We both fell apart when the going got real rough
I've learned how to give now but what good does it do
But no one can touch me like you used to do

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

I know your opinion of me isn't good
Please try to understand that I'd change, I'd change if I could
This coldness inside of me, lord it's starting to build
And a woman isn't a woman until she's fulfilled

But it's not losing you that's got me down so low
I just can't find another man to take your place

I know no one can
