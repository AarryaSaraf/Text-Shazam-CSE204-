Let's burn down the cornfield
Let's burn down, baby, the cornfield
And we'll listen, we'll listen to it burn

You hide behind the oak tree
I want you to hide behind that
You know that old oak tree
Stay, stay out of danger
Keep outta sight, babe, 'til I return

It's so, it's so good
On a cold, cold night, yeah
To have a fire, a fire burnin'
Burnin' warm, warm and bright, oh yeah

You hide behind the oak tree
And I want you to stay out of sight, baby
Get behind that old, old oak tree
And stay, stay, get out of danger, Lord, 'til I return

Let's burn down the cornfield
Come on, baby, let's set fire, set fire
Set fire to the cornfield
And ooh, ooh, and we'll make love, ooh, we'll make love
Ooh, while it's burnin', yeah, while it's burnin'
Get a warm, get a warm, warm fire goin', baby
And we'll make love, ooh, it'll be so good while it's burnin'
While it's burnin', it'll be so, so good, baby
Ooh, ha ha ha, while it's burnin', burnin', burnin'
