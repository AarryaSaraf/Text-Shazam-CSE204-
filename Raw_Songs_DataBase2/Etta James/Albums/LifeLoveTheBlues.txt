// Spoonful //

It could be a spoonful of coffee
It could be a spoonful of tea
But one little spoon of your precious love
Is good enough for me

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fight about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

It could be a spoonful of water
To save you from the desert sand
But one spoon of love from my forty five
Will save you from another man

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

It could be a spoonful of sugar
It could be a spoonful of tea
But one little spoon of your precious love
Is good enough for me

Men lie about that spoonful
Some cry about that spoonful
Some die about that spoonful
Everybody fightin' about a spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful

// Born Under A Bad Sign //

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Wine and women is all I crave
A big fat woman
Who is going to carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad sign
Born under a bad

// Here I Am (Come And Take Me) //

I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me baby
That makes the world go 'round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half

Our love is you and me baby
That makes the world go 'round
And if you've been doin' lovin' with me
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Squeeze me
Here I am, baby

When I'm down
I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can

But it don't take much from me
Just my cup of Joe
Oh there's love inside me
I believe there's going to be an explosion

It's tough for me, oh baby
I can do worry
Tell me all your troubles
You won't ever have to worry now

Just one more thing, ask everybody
Everybody you see, no, no
You'll find yourself lost
And alone on a darkened street

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, take me
Here I am, show me, won't you

Here I am, baby
Come and take me
Won't you teach me, baby?
Won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby

// Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler) //

Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make you wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
Way they do my life

This ain't livin', this ain't livin'
No, no, baby, this ain't livin'
No, no, no, no, no

Inflation, no chance
To increase the finance
Bills piled up sky high
Send that boy off to die

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is, honey that
I can't pay my taxes

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, it makes me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is, honey that
I can't pay my taxes

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Yeah, make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
'Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make you wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands

Throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands

Make me wanna holler
Throw up my hands
Make me wanna holler

// If You Want Me To Stay //

Alright!

If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
Available for you to see
I'm about to go and then you'll know
For me to stay, I got to be me

You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone, forget reachin' me by phone
'Cause I promise I'll be gone for a while

And when you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
You got to get it straight, how could I ever be late
When you're my man takin' up my time

How could I ever allow? I guess I wonder how
Could you get out a pocket for fun
When you know that you're number two
Number one gonna be number one

I'll be good to you, I wish I could
I get this message over to you now, oh baby

When you see me again, I hope that you have been
The kind of person you really are now
I'll be so good, I wish, I could
Get the message over to you now

And if you want me to stay, baby, if you want me to stay
If you want me to stay, I'll be around today
Available for you to see
I'm about to go and then you'll know
For me to stay, I got to be me

You'll never be in doubt, that's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay, hey babe

If you need me to stay
If you want me to stay, baby

Count the days I'm gone, baby
Count the days I'm gone, baby
Count the days I'm gone, yeah

Yeah, baby, I'll stay around if you want me, oh baby
If you want me, I'll be around

// The Love You Save May Be Your Own //

I'm talking to all the lovers in the house tonight
Now listen, you know I want you to find out what's wrong
And get it right, or you should leave love alone
Because the love you save, it might be your own

People, I've been misled and I've been afraid
I've been hit in the head, ohh, and left for dead
I've been abused, woah and I've been accused
Been refused a piece of bread

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
May very well be your own

I've been pushed around, oh yeah, and I've been lost and found
Given the sundown to get out of town
I've been taken outside, oh and I've been brutalized
I had to always be the one to smile and apologize

But I ain't never in my life before
Seen so many love affairs go wrong as I do today

I want you to stop, find out what's wrong
Get it right or leave love alone
Because the love you save today
Might very well be your own

// I'll Take Care Of You //

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
But if you let me here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you

I, I've loved and lost the same as you
So you see I know just what you've been through
But if you'll let me here's what I'll do
Oh, I just got to take care of you

You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to cry
I'll be there beside you
To dry your weeping eyes

So darling tell me that you'll be true
For there is no doubt in my mind I know what I want to do
Understand, sure as one and one is two
Oh, you know I'll take care of you
I'll take care of you
