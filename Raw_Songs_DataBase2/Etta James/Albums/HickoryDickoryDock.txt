// Hickory Dickory Dock //

Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock
I wanna turn back, I wanna turn back
I wanna turn back the clock

I wanna live last night again
Hold my baby tight again
Hickory dickory, dickory dock

Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock
I'm doin' a flip, such a big flip
Flippin' all around the block

Last night at a quarter to nine
Lover man said he'd be mine
Hickory dickory, dickory dock

He came a callin'
We went ballin'
Last night around a quarter to eight

We went to see a show
Don't know what I saw
But the kissin' was great

Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock
Look at me shake, look at me quake
Look at my poor heart rock

And I've got news for you
Oh, we're gonna say, "I do"
Hickory dickory, dickory dock

He came a callin'
We went ballin'
Last night around a quarter to eight

We went to see a show
Don't know what I saw
But the kissin' was great

Hickory dickory dock, hickory dickory dock
Look at me shake, look at me quake
Look at my poor heart rock

And I've got news for you
Oh, we're gonna say, "I do"
Hickory dickory, dickory dock

Hickory dickory, dickory dock
Hickory dickory, dickory dock
Hickory dickory, dickory dock

// W-O-M-A-N //

Talkin' about you a man always ready to go
Now when it comes to movin', babe you're awful slow
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

You ain't got nothing in your pockets to keep me alive
But I got something for all you men to make you cry
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

Well Davey Crokett king of the wild frontier
I'll tame him down the hell [?] he was in
Jesse James, baddest man in the land
You shoulda saw me when I had him eatin', out of my hand

Now Dillinger, the woman in red got him
Now that should teach ya about a w-o-m-a-n
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman, woman, woman, woman, woman

// I'm A Fool //

Oh, oh, yes
Oh, oh, yes

I'm a fool to love you, I'm a fool to care
But I know some, someday baby
You will be a fool just like me, just like me

I'm a fool to cry my heart out over someone like you
But I know some, someday baby
You will be a fool just like me, just like me

I'm a fool to want you when you hate me all the time
I'm a fool to let you get under my skin
But I can't get you out of my mind

I'm a fool to need you when I know you don't care
But I know some, someday baby
You will be a fool just like me, just like me

But I can't get you out of my mind

I'm a fool to need you when I know you don't care
But I know some, someday baby
You will be a fool just like me, [?] just like me
Just like me, don't you know just like me, just like me

// Strange Things Happening //

Oh, I see you out late at night
You don't treat your baby right
There's strange things happenin' everyday

The love that you refuse
Some other man can use
Strange things are happenin' everyday

Everyday, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
There's strange things happenin' everyday

The love that you refuse
Some other man can use
Strange things are happenin' everyday

The way you never miss the water
Until your well runs dry
Strange things are happenin' everyday

I won't be satisfied
Till I see teardrops in your eyes
Strange things are happenin' everyday

Yes, everyday, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
There's strange things happenin' everyday

I won't be satisfied
Till I see teardrops in your eyes
Strange things are happenin' everyday

Oh, well you thought I was a fool
But I got blues for you
Strange things are happenin' everyday

I found this someone new
And I'm feelin' through you
Strange things are happenin' everyday

Everyday, everyday
(Everyday, everyday)
There's strange things happenin' everyday

Found this someone new
And I'm feelin' through you
Strange things are happenin' everyday

Yes, strange things are happenin', happenin' everyday

// Hey Henry //

You couldn't dance at all
But now you're over ball
The way Texas hop
The way you jump and rock
(Talk to me, baby)

You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you jump and rock
(Alright)
You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you do the bop
But how am I doin' now?
And everything is alright

But when we do the boogie woogie
Shake it all night long
When we do the boogie woogie
Shake it all night long
Shake it, shake it, Henry
Till the band goes home

Henry, oh, Henry
Love the way you jump and rock
(Alright)
Henry, oh Henry
Love the way you Texas hop
But how am I doin' now?
And everything is alright

Well, well, well, well, baby
The dance you're doin' is movin' me
Well, let's dance and rock till the rooster crows
And we'll rest a while, dance some more

You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you jump and rock
You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you do the bop
But how am I doin' now?
And everything is alright

Well, well, well, well, baby
The dance you're doin' is movin' me
Let's dance and rock till the rooster crows
And we'll rest a while, dance some more

You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you jump and rock
(Alright, baby)
You're doin' fine, Henry
The way you do the bop
(Okay)

But how am I doin' now? Alright
How am I doin' now? Alright
How am I doin' now?
Everything is alright

// Good Rockin' Daddy //

Jumpin' fast or rockin' slow

Now hold it, don't move it now boogie some more

I'm a good rockin' daddy
Yeah well I'm a good rockin' daddy
Up on my feet I can't be beat

I told the boys all to come and see
Just what the sandman brought to me
They stood around with a great big smile
When we start to rock n' roll they all went wild

Good rockin' daddy

Up on my feet I can't be beat
I'm a good rockin' daddy

I'll hold you close and I'll hold you tight

// That's All //

Now come here baby, get ready to go
'Cause I'm in the mood to rock and roll
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all

We'll start to rockin', I don't like to stop
You better get ready to rock around the clock
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all

Don't worry about the time, I got plenty to spend
If the clock run down, we'll wind it up again
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all, yeah

You can learn everything they teach you in school
But if you can't rock and roll, you're not a fool
And that's all, I mean to tell you, that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all
All you have to do is rock and roll and that's all

// Tears Of Joy //

I'm just a fool who really loves you
There is no greater fool than me
You told me lies and I believed you
How big a fool can you be

I close my eyes when people tell me
They saw you kissin' someone new
I just won't let my heart believe it
I'm just a fool in love with you

Some day you may be crying
Crying over me
And if that ever happens
A fool you too may be

Why don't you change your way of livin'?
And walk the straight and never lie
The Lord forgives a fool who's willin'
I'll give the world to make you mine

Some day you may be crying
Crying over me
And if that ever happens
A fool you too, you too may be

Why don't you change your way of livin'?
And walk the straight and never lie
The Lord forgives a fool who's willin'
I'll give the world to make you mine
