// Be Honest with Me //

Be honest with me dear, whatever you do
Remember you're mine dear so always be true
Where ever you wander, on land or on sea
If you really love me, you'd be honest with me

My poor heart would break dear if you were untrue
Asleep or awake dear, I'll dream about you
For you are my darling, you're all that I see
If you really love me, you'd be honest with me

Someday I'll return dear and make you, make you my own
And how I will yearn dear when I'm all alone
I'll never forget you and your sweet memory
If you really love me, be honest, be honest with me

// Blow Top Blues //

I've got bad news, baby
And you're the first to know
I've got bad news, baby
And you're the first to know
I discovered this morning that my top is about to blow

I've been rocking on my feet
And been talking all out of my head
I've been rocking on my feet
And been talking all out of my head
When I get through talking, don't remember a thing I've said

I used to be a sharpie
Always dressed in the latest styles
But now I'm walking down Broadway
Wearing nothing but a smile
I see all kinds of little men
Although they're never there
I tried to push a subway train
Poured whiskey in my hair
I'm a gal you can't excuse, I've got those blowtop blues

Last night I was five feet tall, today I'm eight feet ten
And every time I fall downstairs, I float right up again
When somebody turned the lights on me it like to drove me blind
And I woke up in Bellevue but I've left my mind behind
I'm a gal who blew a fuse, I've got those blowtop blues

// Cry Me A River //

Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember? I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Cry me a river, cry me a river
And I cried a river over you

Yeah

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember? I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove, just to prove you do
Cry me a river, cry me a river
And I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

// Feel Like Breaking Up Somebody's Home //

Lying 'round home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss

Every raindrop I hear
Against my window pane
Speaks so loud and clear, oh Lord
Spelled out your name

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless hanging on
When you belong to someone else
Can't control the feeling
'Cause after all I didn't make myself

Last night I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't stand the vibration
Oh, my heart just won't stand still

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless hanging on
When you belong to someone else
Can't control my feeling
'Cause after all I didn't make myself

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like smashing up somebody's home
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

// Fools We Mortals Be //

A little fool

A little fool

Only to find... that you will never strong for me

For you can see this will never ever be

A little fool
Make a fool of me
That's how you see
what fools we mortals be

Oh, I waited, waited how long out for you
Only to find... that you will never strong for me
I wanted you, I needed you, I'm not succeded you
For you can see this will never ever be

A little fool
Make a fool of me
That's how you see
what fools we mortals be

// I Found A Love //

I found a love
I found a love
I found a love, baby
That I need, oh yeah

Now listen,
I found, I found a kiss, oh yeah
I just want to tell you I can't, I can't resist
Believe me now

Whoa, that I need baby

I just want to call him, help me

Yeah, oh oh oh, 
Yeah, yeah, whoa yeah, yeah now, oh now

Now wait a minute,
There's one thing I want to say right here
The way my man walks
He set my soul on fire
Oh, the way he talks to me in the wee hours of the morning
He's my heart's, he's my heart's desire

And if, he'll ever leave me
Let me tell you
I believe that I would die, baby
I would die y'all, oh yeah

Now help me call him now,
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah 
Oh I can't help it
The way you make me feel right now

// Nobody Loves Me //

Nobody loves me
No, nobody cares
When I call you, baby
You're never there
And sometimes I feel
No more can I bear
For my love
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody, nobody cares
Nobody cares

When I'm in despair
Nobody cares
If I'm pulling out my hair
And sometimes I feel
No more can I bear
This pain is too much, too much for me to stand
Nobody cares
(Nobody cares)
Oooh, nobody cares
(Nobody cares)
Nobody
No
Nobody cares, no

Sometimes I feel
I feel
No more can I bear
For my love
My love
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody cares
Nobody cares
(Nobody cares)

When I'm, when I'm in despair
(Nobody cares)
You know and I know that nobody cares
When I pull out my hair
Nobody
Nobody
(Nobody cares)
Nobody
Nobody

// Slow And Easy //

Now you're always rushing baby
Always in a hurry
Making lots of tracks, gettin' nowhere
And that makes me worry
Cos when you start loving me honey
Please take your time
A sixty minute man just won't do
I'm putting my case on the line

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

Now when love me baby
Don't act like you're going to put out no fire
When you start working on my case
Take as much time as you require
I don't want you, no no
To be in no rush
Honey, groove me, upset me
With your loving touch

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

I know love makes the world go round
And that's a real true fact
And when you love me real good honey
Oh boy, you're on the right track
Now listen, just take your time now
And do the job right
Cos when you get your thing together, baby
You have better be a little tight

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

Do the job slow and easy honey
Real slow and easy, baby
Work on my case right now honey
Go on and turn me on boy
Ooh, sock it to me honey
Slow and easy, baby
Lay it on me baby, right now
Not talking 'bout tomorrow but right now, honey
Ooh baby, throw it on me
Lay it on me, sock it to me, push it to me

// The Soul of a Man //

The soul of a man touches something inside of me
Something too deep for anyone else to see
And the whole world wants to know why I love him so
But I'm afraid they just wouldn't understand

My love for a man is something I can't explain
And every tear I shed, I know it's wasted in vain
But there's something I can't reveal that I so deeply feel
Oh it must be, it's gotta be the soul of the man

I cried and I cried 'till I just can't cry no more
I know the man really don't love me but he just won't let me go
He controls my heart, my mind and my soul
And he's got the power to make me stay when I really wanna go

The soul of a man, it turns my mind around
It takes my helpless heart and turns it upside down
And the whole world wants to know why I love him so
Oh it must be, just gotta be the soul of a man

Ow, got to be, got to be, got to be the soul of a man

// Tighten Up Your Own Thing //

Oh, ooh hoohoo, ah ah, ah!

Stop talking about Mr. Charlie!
He ain't nothin' but a man
I want you to stop preachin' hate, brother
Go out and shake a few hands
Oh, Got everything you need, yeah
To make your life really swing
All you gotta do is

Tighten up your own thing, baby
Tighten up your own thing, yeah
Tighten up!
Your own thing

Let wisdom be your hammer
Let progress be your aim
You're bound to hit it big one day, brother
Freedom will be your claim
Oh, you gotta stop drawing lines
Start pulling strings
All you need to do is

Tighten up your own thing, babe
Tighten up your own thing
Oh! Tighten up! Oohoo! Hoo...

Oh! Ooh hoo!

Now, people ain't nothing but flesh and blood, now
And thats all there is to that!
Let me tell you, flesh and blood don't make em bad, no, no
Its the way they live and act
Now listen, you're not in the dark no more!
You've got your civil rights!
All you need to do is

Tighten up your own thing, baby
Tighten up your own thing
Oh, tighten up!
Get together!
Tighten up!
Pull it tighter, now!
Stop segregating!
Do some integrating!
Pull it together, now!
Be brothers and sisters, yeah
All men together now!
Stop fighting, killing one another, now
Get it together!
Oh, tighten up!

// Would It Make Any Difference To You? //

If you read in the paper that I went away
Would it make any difference to you?
If I packed my things and left town today
Would it make any difference to you?

Do you, do you even know...
Do you even know that I'm still alive?
Oh, I wonder
I wonder if I ever, oh, cross...
If I ever cross your sweet mind

If I got in, if I got into trouble
Would I send for you?
Would you come, would you come
Or would you stay away?

If we never love again
Like we used to do
Would it make, oh...
Would it make any difference, oh, to you?

// You Lost That Lovin' Feelin' //

You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips

You're trying hard not to show it (Baby)
But baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize
Every little thing I do

It makes me just feel like crying (Baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful is dying

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Baby, baby, baby I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So please don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

You let it slip away, you let it slip away
You let it get gone, baby

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

You let it slip away in the midnight hour one night
I remember so clearly, it was gone
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
It wasn't there anymore, it had gone
Believe what I say baby
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone

// You Took It //

You know you took it
Oh yeah yeah honey
Baby you took it honey
Yes you did
You took a great big piece, piece of my heart
When you, when you said goodbye
Oh you did honey
You know you took it baby
Yes now child
You took it baby, yes you did
You took a great big piece,
Great big chunk of my heart
When you said goodbye

When we were young
Whoa now, we fell in love
Oh baby yeah
I was your girl, yeah
And you were my boy, yes you were now
Ooh baby
Then something happened, honey
I don't know, something, 
Something tore us apart
And, and took a great big piece of my heart
Ohh, that's what you did now, baby
You know you took it honey
Yes you did now
Ooh yeah child you took it baby
Ohh yeah
You took a great big piece, 
A great big chunk of my heart
When you said goodbye

You know you took it baby
Ooh now

Yeah, yeah
You took a great big piece of my heart
When you said, when you said goodbye
Ooh yeah now

I wish you a whole lot of happiness
With your new girl
Guess I have to find myself another, another boy
Yes I will
But this time I wanna know, baby
I got to know now
Right from the start
He won't walk away
Walk away and take my, take my heart
'Cos that's what you did, now
You know, you know you took it baby
Ooh now, everybody knows honey you took it, baby
Yes you did now
Ooh, you took a great big, a great big piece of my heart
When you said goodbye
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah you took it, you took it, you took it honey baby...
