I'm sorry
For something I didn't do
Lynched somebody
But I didn't know who

You blame me
For slavery
A hundred years before I was born

Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 




Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 


I'm convicted
Of a racist crime
I've only served
19 years of my life



Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 
Guilty of being white 

Guilty of being right
