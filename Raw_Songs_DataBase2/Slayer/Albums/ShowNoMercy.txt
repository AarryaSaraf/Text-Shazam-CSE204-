// Evil Has No Boundaries //

[Lyrics - Hanneman, King; Music - King]

Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell
No one can stop us tonight
We take on the world with hatred inside
Mayhem the reason we fight
Surviving the slaughters and killing we've lost
Then we return from the dead
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength
We conquer then move on ahead

[Chorus:]
Evil
My words defy
Evil
Has no disguise
Evil
Will take your soul
Evil
My wrath unfolds

Satan our master in evil mayhem
Guides us with every first step
Our axes are growing with power and fury
Soon there'll be nothingness left
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on
Evil is at our command
We clash with God's angel and conquer new souls
Consuming all that we can

[Chorus]

// The Antichrist //

[Lyrics - Hanneman; Music - Hanneman, King]

Screams and nightmares
Of a life I want
Can't see living this lie no
A world I haunt
You've lost all control of my
Heart and soul
Satan holds my future
Watch it unfold

I am the Antichrist
It's what I was meant to be
Your God left me behind
And set my soul to be free

Watching disciples
Of the satanic rule
Pentagram of blood
Holds the jackal's truth
Searching for the answer
Christ hasn't come
Awaiting the final moment
The birth of Satan's son

Screams,
From a life I live
Torment,
Is what I give
Torture,
Is what I love
The down fall,
Of the heavens above

I am the Antichrist
All love is lost
Insanity is what I am
Eternally my soul will rot (rot... rot)

// Die By The Sword //

[Lyrics - Hanneman; Music - Hanneman]

Live by the sword and help to contain
The helpless minds of you all
Die by my hand in pools of blood
Clutch yourself as you fall
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims
Children slaughtered in vain
Raping the maids, in which they serve
Only the words of the Lord

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Satan watches all of us
Smiles as some do his bidding
Try to escape the grasp of my hand
And your life will no longer exist
Hear our cry, save us from
The Hell in which we live
We turn our heads toward the sky
And listen for the steel

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

Watch as flowers decay
On (the) cryptic life that died
The wisdom of the wizards
Is only a neurtured lie
Black knights of Hell's domain
Walk upon the dead
Satanas sits upon
The blood on which he feeds

Die by the sword
Die by the sword

// Fight Till Death //

[Lyrics - Hanneman; Music - Hanneman]

Metal and men clash once more to the end
Warriors above with the power to kill descend
Militia of blood troops of hate march to die
Soldiers of Hell veterans of death arise

[Chorus:]
Prepare for attack
Your body will burn
Endless war
There's no return
Prepare for attack
Death will arrive
Your orders are clear
No way to hide
Fight till death

Senseless death of all mankind overtakes
Armored assassins destroy at will your escape
Children of sorrow are trampled into the grave
There is no future no (fucking) world to (be) save(d).

[Chorus]

(To reign in Hell)

Gods of steel unleash their destruction on man
Reign of death what is the final command
Sceptors of hate are dropped upon the Earth
Clouds of terror destroy all hope of rebirth

[Chorus]
Fight till death [x3]

// Face The Slayer //

[Lyrics - King; Music - Hanneman, King]

A misty night, a perfect night
Beneath the cold of the frozen star
You feel the fright, you know I'm near
You never should have come this far
I am alive, you can't kill me
I will survive eternity

Go through the fire walk past the dead
Lost in my eternal maze
Your heart pounds through the mist filled air
Your concentration breaks for me to strike
You've cowered down, you've broken the chain
Now I can freeze your burning eyes

You see me lift the axe, (as) it plunges through your shield
You now begin to panic as you see your chances grow slim
Your running through the endless maze
(You) Turn and I'll be there
A force too strong for you to fight
Your end I'll see tonight ("I'll see your end tonight")

You think you can destroy (me)? You'd better think again
I am eternal terror my quest will never end
I'll trap you in the pentagram
And seal your battered tomb
Your life is just another game
For Satan's night of doom

// Black Magic //

[Lyrics - King; Music - Hanneman, King]

Cursed
Black magic night
We've been struck down
Down in this Hell
Spells surround me day and night
Stricken by the force of evil light
The force of evil light

Cast
Under his spell
Blinding my eyes
Twisting my mind
Fight to resist the evil inside
Captive of a force of Satan's might
A force of Satan's might

Fighting the curse
Break it I must
Laughing in sorrow
Crying in lust

My strength slips fast
Soon I must fall
Victim of fortune
My sources grow small
Life slips away
As demons come forth
Death takes my hand
And captures my soul

// Tormentor //

[Lyrics - Hanneman; Music - Hanneman]

Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Hoping for relief
From the fear you feel inside
Losing all perspective
Of reality in the night

[Chorus:]
Running from shadows
Blinded by fear
The horror of nightfall
Is ever so near
I slowly surround you
As terror sets in
Are you afraid of the night

I see the fright in your eyes
As you turn and run
But is your mind playing tricks
On a body so very young
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine

[Chorus]

Afraid to walk the streets
In the coldness all alone
The blackness of the night
Engulfs your flesh and bones
Feeling as if no one cares
The fear runs down your spine
But I know I'll never rest
Until I know you're mine
I know you're mine
Too late to hide
Too late to save your life
Tormentor

// The Final Command //

[Lyrics - King; Music - Hanneman, King]

Screams of terror across the sea
Begging for mercy in their one final plea
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death
Fighting and killing to their very last breath
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
He makes his move to conquer the land
Turning all hopes of life to sand

[Chorus:]
Machine gun fire, blood level higher
Visions of torture and terror to all
Ready for battle awaiting the final command

Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen
Awaiting our victory ending his dream
Cursed are the souls who defy his will
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Shocking the world with his mass devastation
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation

[Chorus]

At the crack of dawn they storm again
Hunting, fighting and killing all men
The end is near our time now short
Our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command
Born with the power of God in his hand
Withdrawn from fighting he now takes his leave
Seeking out goals that can't be conceived

[Chorus]

// Crionics //

[Lyrics - Hanneman, King; Music - Hanneman, King]

Eyes upon me
Watching me in my perpetual sleep
Dreams deceive me
My future depends on a mindless dream
I've fallen from promises
Damned to take risks on my own
The masterful science that freezes your
Mind and your soul
The wretched dream is realized
The human race is to be crystallized

Thoughts of laughter
Filling the head of the master in charge.
Worlds of wonder
Is this a cure or a painless death
I'll fight and resist
Till they all see the end that is near
The doctors the lawers and G-men
Are living in fear
Living my life with one distant hope
A cure that will kill my invincible foe

// Show No Mercy //

[Lyrics - King; Music - King]

Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords at night we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust

[Chorus]
Stalking the night can't you feel I'm near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force ("...their fate") [1:st & 3:rd time]

Brothers of the Prince of Night
By bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls
Our legions we must save
Fight for our eternal quest
God can't save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us
Your soul it shall be mine

[Chorus]

I am the menace in your eyes
The one you can't escape
Your life falls in my grasp
Your know your end is near
You pray your God will help
His strength no match for mine
Your last hope slips away
Thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds
Burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood
A victim of my force
In endless agony
You realize your defeat
Recite my Master's chants
Your soul now his to keep
