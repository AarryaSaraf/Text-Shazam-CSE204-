All you've gotta do is find yourself
You lose all the time you wasted
Something yeah, oh yeah
Love if you think straight
There's no reason why you shouldn't find yourself

A jealous mind
All it does is corrupt your time (Corrupt your time, blow your mind)
A heart full of hate, oh yeah
Can be a bad mistake
There might come a day
Well, that you fail to see
A better idea in life
 better day

All you've got to do is find yourself (Well, well, oh yeah, yeah)
Find yourself (Oh baby, oh yeah)
Find yourself (Oh)
All you've got to do is find yourself

If you find me, you better listen well
You can find  situation gettin' better every day
All you've got to do is find yourself
Find yourself

You can sit down and cry your eyes away
Until your tears have all gone
But when you realize
That you didn't want to stay
Get your head on right, you can't go wrong

You've got to find yourself, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself, yeah
You've got to find yourself
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Find yourself
