I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overlord
I hear you singin' in the wire
And I hear you in the wild
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line

I know I'll need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
If it snows, that stretch down south
Will never stand this rain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman
Is still on the line
Still on the line
Still on the line
