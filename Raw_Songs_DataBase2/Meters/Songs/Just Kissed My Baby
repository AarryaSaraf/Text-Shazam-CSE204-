I feel like a king
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Money don't mean a thing
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Way down inside
A man is a man
And a woman is a woman

Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Get along

I feel so good inside
'Cause I just kissed my baby
Half your share is my share
And my share is your share, too
Squeeze my lemon
'Til the juice runs down my leg
Feel like a king
'Cause I just kissed my baby

Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Well, well, well just kissed my baby (where'd you kiss her?)
Get along

Night people
Hanging out
Looking at each other
Waiting for something to happen
