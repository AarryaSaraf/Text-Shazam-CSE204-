(Here comes the jungle man
Good Lord)

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
I'm the jungle man
That's what I am

In the jungle I'm the king
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man

Got my home, don't need to roam
The jungle is where I live
Peace and love and harmony
Is what I have to give

I'm friends with the monkey
I'm friends with the bird
I'm close with the lion
They all got the word

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am

In the jungle I'm the king
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man
I'm the jungle man
He's the jungle man

Get it!
Uh, black and white, full of stripes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Black and white, full of stripes

I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
Oh, I'm the jungle man
That's what I am
