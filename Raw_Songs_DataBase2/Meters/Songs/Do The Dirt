Listen people, come on, listen good
We're gonna dance, gonna do you some good
You've got to pull off your shoes
You've got to pull off your shirt

Relax yourself
Getting ready to do the dirt
Doing the dirt (dirt)
You've got to watch me work (work)

You've got to stretch your legs as far as you can
Stretch your legs now, so your knees won't bend
You've got to bend your hips, you've got to bend it good
Shuffle your arms, like I know would
Doing the dirt, doing the dirty, dirty
Dirty, dirty, dirty now, get nasty

You've got to step some to the left
You've got to step some to the right
Feels so good now, you can do it all night

Relax yourself
Getting ready to do the dirt
Doing the dirt (dirt)
You've got to watch me work (work)
...

I know you can do it now
You've got to bend your hips, you've got to bend it good
You've got to shuffle your arms, like I know would
...
