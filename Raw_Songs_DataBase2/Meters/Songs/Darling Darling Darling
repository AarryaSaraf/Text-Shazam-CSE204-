I say darlin' darlin', whoa my darlin'
Don't you know I love you now
I say darlin' darlin', whoa my darlin'
Don't you know I love you
Baby, say you gonna be mine
I'm gonna love you till the end of time
And I say darlin' darlin', whoa my darlin'
Don't you know I love you now

I say baby, ooh sweet baby, sweet baby
Don't you know I need you
I say baby, baby, oh my baby
Don't you know I need you
Put yo' little hand in mine
I'm gonna give you true love till the end of time
And I say darlin' oh my darlin'
Don't you know I love you now

I say baby, ooh sweet baby, sweet baby

I say baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't you know I love you
Girl, I've been lovin' you for so long
Ooh, don't you think it's about time I take you home
And I say darlin' oh my darlin' my darlin'
I swear I love you

Baby, baby, baby
I need you, baby...
