// Fire On The Bayou //

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

Down in New Orleans
In Lucky's din
He wouldn't deal y'all
For a fifth of Gin
One dude wanted
A bottle of wine
Hit that dude yes he did
For a dollar and a dime
That's why I say y'all
Light your

Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou
Oh hey light the fire
Fire on the bayou
Fire on the bayou

Take a little toke, huh
On your smoke
Buy yourself
A bottle of wine
Cool, cool wine y'all
Going down your throat
Don't try to tell me
Don't make you feel real fine
That's why I say y'all
Light your

Fire on the bayou
Hey light your fire
Fire on the bayou
Go do like you wanna
Fire on the bayou
Hey light your fire
Fire on the bayou
Do, do, do your thing

Fire on the bayou
Ooh Lord have mercy
Fire on the bayou
I got a nickel now
You got a dime
Let's get together y'all
Goin' have a good time
Goin' to buy a fifth
Goin' buy a joint
When you gettin' down now
You doin' things right
That's why I say

Fire on the bayou
Hey lil' mama now
Fire on the bayou
Hey light your fire
Fire on the bayou
Hey, on the bayou now
Fire on the bayou

Do it
Light your fire now
It's alright y'all
Feels so good, feels so good
On the sideline
Take your handkerchief
Take your handkerchief
And tell Leo now
Let the fool know what to do
C'mon lil' brother now
Oh do it like you wanna

// They All Ask'd For You //

Hey, Lamba
Crawfish etouffee
They all asked for you

I went on down to the Audubon Zoo
And they all asked for you
They all asked for you
(For who?)
Well, they even inquired about you
I went on down to the Audubon Zoo
And they all asked for you
The monkeys asked
The tigers asked
And the elephant asked me too

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boo, dee bee doo, poo boom
Boom, boom
Boo, dee bee doo, poo boom

I went on up to the big ol' sky
And they all asked for you
(For who?)
They all asked for you
Well, they even inquire about you
I went on up to the big ol' sky
And they all asked for you
The ducks asked
The eagles asked
And the buzzard asked me too

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boo, dee bee doo, poo boom
Boom, boom
Boo, dee bee doo, poo boom

I went on down to the deep blue sea
And they all asked for you
They all asked for you
(For me?)
Well, they even inquire about you
I went on down to the deep blue sea
And they all asked for you
(For me?)
The shark asked
The whale asked
And the barracuda asked me too

They all asked for you
(Every morning)
They all asked for you
(Every morning)
Every there, all over there

They all asked for you
(Every morning)
They all asked for you
(Every evening)
They all asked for you

// Mardi Gras Mambo //

Down in New Orleans where the blues was born
Takes a cool cat to blow a horn
On Lasalle and Rampart Street
Combo's playin' with a mambo beat

Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo down in New Orlean

In Gert Town where the cats all meet
There's a Mardi Gras Mambo with a beat
They shout and cheer for the Zulu gang
Truck on down where the Mambos swing

Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo down in New Orlean

Down in New Orleans where the blues was born
Takes a cool cat to blow a horn
On Lasalle and Rampart Street
Combo's playin' with a mambo beat

Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo down in New Orlean

Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo

Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras Mambo, Mambo, Mambo
Mardi Gras
