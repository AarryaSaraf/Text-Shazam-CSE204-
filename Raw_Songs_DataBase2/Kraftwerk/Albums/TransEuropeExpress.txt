// The Hall Of Mirrors //

The young man stepped into the Hall of Mirrors
Where he discovered a reflection of himself

Even the greatest Stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Discover themselves in the looking glass

Sometimes, he saw his real face
And sometimes, a stranger at his place

Even the greatest Stars
Find their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Find their face in the looking glass

He fell in love with the image of himself
And suddenly, the picture was distorted

Even the greatest Stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Dislike themselves in the looking glass

He made up the person he wanted to be
And changed into a new personality

Even the greatest Stars 
Change themselves in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars 
Change themselves in the looking glass

The artist is living in the mirror
With the echoes of himself

Even the greatest Stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Live their lives in the looking glass

Even the greatest Stars
Fix their face in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Fix their face in the looking glass

Even the greatest Stars
Live their lives in the looking glass
Even the greatest Stars
Live their lives in the looking glass

// Showroom Dummies //

Eins, zwei, drei, vier

We are standing here
Exposing ourselves
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We're being watched
And we feel our pulse
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We look around
And change our pose
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We start to move
And we break the glass
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We step out
And take a walk through the city
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We go into a club
And there we start to dance
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies

We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
We are showroom dummies
