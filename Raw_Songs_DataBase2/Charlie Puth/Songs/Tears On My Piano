I'm sick and tired of singing the wrong words (Words that you don't want to hear)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (Right before you disappeared)
Hoping that my voice will remind you (Everything that we've been through)
All I make is music for crying (Gonna need some more tissues)
Oh, like a river they fall
Tell me why every song I write sounds so sad, sad, sad

I can't get my mind off you
Baby you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

I'm sick and tired of singing the wrong words (Words that I don't want to say)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (But they'll never sound the same)
Hoping that my voice will remind you (When the radio comes on)
All I make is music for crying ('Cause you're the only one I want)
Oh, like a river they fall (Like a river they fall)
Tell me why every song I write sounds so sad, sad, sad

I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody (Melody), that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

Yeah, you know who you are
I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)
So if it's on in your car, I don't have any shame
That every song I write is, I want you back
It's so fucking sad, baby

I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody (Melody) that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Yeah, you know who you are
I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)

Can't think of a melody that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
