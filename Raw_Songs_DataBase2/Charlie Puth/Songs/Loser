Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win

I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (Ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (Ah)
I should have never let her slip away

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody
Up against her body (Ooh) at 2 am
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again

I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
Now she's in love and I'm in second place (Damn)

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
(I say) Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser

Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I living for nothing?
Don't know where it went wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I'm a loser

Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser (I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (Oh, I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (And I say)
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
