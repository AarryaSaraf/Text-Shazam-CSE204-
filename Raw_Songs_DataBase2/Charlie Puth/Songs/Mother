He's such a nice boy
So well mannered
He's so much better than the last one you've brought around
Please and thank you
Everything matters
I'm gonna make sure that she knows I'm the best she's found

The moment she walks out the door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Sneak out the window
Pass over pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo
More than the friend zone
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock

The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me

Yeah
If your mother only knew

The moment she walks out the door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me

(If your mother knew all the things we do)
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
