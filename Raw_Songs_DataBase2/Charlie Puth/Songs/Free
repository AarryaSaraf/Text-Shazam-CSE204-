They'll never know just who you are
But they can't turn your bright star dark
They'll try to hold your spirit down
Couldn't do it then, can't do it now

They'll try to tell you who to be
But they can't change the way you feel
Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feeling they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free is just knowin' that you were born to
To be free, free

They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you were built too strong for that
Can't tame a wild heart

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free

Oh, no one's ever puttin' out that fire inside
Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back
Runnin' fast and free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feeling they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free is just knowin' that you were born to
To be free, yeah
Free, yeah
Free, free
Free
Oh, free
