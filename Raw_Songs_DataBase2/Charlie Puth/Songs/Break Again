Well, I'm crying
And I'm dying
Cause I really thought that you would be the one
And I tried to
Stand beside you
But it was over way before it had begun
I like to think it's all ok
And one day you'll come back and stay with me
Come and stay with me

But now you're gone
And I don't know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause I can't afford to have my heart, break again
I just thought that maybe you'd change
But you're still the same the same the same
As you were back then
I've had enough
Enough of you
And I can't let you break my heart again

Lately, everyday now
I go to bed and sleep my life away 'till four
Cause I don't know (cause I don't know)
What it feels like (what it feels like)
To not wake up and run a mile right to your door

You're still gone
And I don't know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause I can't afford to have my heart, break again
I just thought that maybe you'd change
But you're still the same the same the same
As you were back then
I've had enough
Enough of you
And I can't let you break my heart again

Why you gotta break my heart again?
And I can't keep holding on...

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause my hearts gonna break again

I've had enough
Gave it my all
Just thought you changed
But I was wrong
And now that you're gone (now that you're gone)
You can't break my heart again

Again, you can't break my heart again
