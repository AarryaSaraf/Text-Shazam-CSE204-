Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry for somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

Saw her on the TV
Had the bleach pink hair with the ripped jeans
And I thought, "What if I could meet her in real life?" (Yeah)
I found out that we shared friends
So she came to the house on the weekend
And what I had in my head happened later that night (Yeah)

All I need is one little memory
To make all these feelings come back up, yeah

Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry for somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

Stayed up, late night
We were trying our best to pretend like
That when the party's done, we'll go our separate ways
But we knew, yeah, we knew
Pretty soon, it would be only us two
Then after what we did, I'd never be the same (Yeah)

All I need is one little memory (I need, oh)
To make all these feelings come back up, yeah

Never thought that I would actually miss you, no
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat (Mess with my heartbeat)
Never thought that I would cry for somebody (Oh)
But maybe there's a first time for everything, yeah
Maybe there's a first time for everything
