Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

Ever since the da-day y-you went away
(No, I don't know how)
How to erase your body from out my brain
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
Maybe I should just focus on me instead
(But all I think about)
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

Oh no (Oh no)
Oh no (Oh no)
You're going 'round in circles, got you stuck up in my head (Yeah)

Memories follow me left and right
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
Your love stays with me day and night
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

Ever since the da-day y-you went away
(Someone tell me how)
How much more do I gotta drink for the pain
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
You did things to me that I just can't forget
(Now all I think about)
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

Oh no (Oh no)
Oh no (Oh no)
You're going 'round in circles, got ya stuck up in my head (Yeah)

Memories follow me left and right
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
Your love stays with me day and night
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

Did ya know you're the one that got away
And even now, baby, I'm still not okay?
Did ya know that my dreams, they're all the same
Everytime I close my eyes?

Memories follow me left and right
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
Your love stays with me day and night
(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

(I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here)
(You take up every corner of my mind)
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
