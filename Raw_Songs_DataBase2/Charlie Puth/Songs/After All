I lie awake and realize
That you're better than my dreams
Thought I found love so many times
'Til you showed me what it means

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, mmm


If you never fell out of the sky
I don't know what I would do
I wouldn't trade one thousand lives
For the one I have with you

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, oh, ah


Baby, after all, oh-oh-woah
It's not the same, not the same, not the same, oh


Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong (Doing it wrong)
{I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all} (After all)
After {all, oh}
Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby (Oh no, baby)
They were just doin' it wrong (Doin' it wrong)
{I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all} (After all)
After {all, oh}
