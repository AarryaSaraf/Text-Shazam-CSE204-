Woah-oh-woah
Woah-oh-woah-woah
Yeah

Weren't you the one
That said you weren't hungry
"Just go ahead and eat your food"
I was the only one
That anticipated that dinner would suck
And my order is about to go through

I'm not eating that food
There's nothing you can do
"Can I have some?" You dream, man
My hands up on the mouse
No one better be in this house
Because

This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my slice, my slice, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza
I waited 30 minutes
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, my pie
Not your freakin' pie it's mine
It's my pizza
My pizza
I waited for so long
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza
Ooooooh
Yeah

Tomatoes, hey I'll see you later
I can't eat you right now
Because I hate vegetables
I'm eating so much now
Much I never dreamed of
God, I am so happy
Now I have to throw up


This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, my pie, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, not your pie
Pizza pie

This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my slice, my slice, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza (oooo)
I waited 30 minutes
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza
