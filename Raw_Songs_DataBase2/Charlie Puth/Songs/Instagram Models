(Oh) I'm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I'm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

She's leading me on the round 
That's perfect but closing down 
I'm crying day you gone 
Ain't taking it no more 
Ain't taking it no more 

She's so good at playing cards
But the minute she brings you joy
She'll shows you the door
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more

(Oh) I'm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I'm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

She's sick of waiting on her roof (UNKNOWN)
Now so tired of waiting her turn
And I ain't tryna go home 
Ain't taking this no more
Ain't taking it no more 

And I never believed it would actually happen
Your body so tempting, my sweetest distraction
Lets get down on the floor
Can't take this no more
Can't take this no more

(Oh) I'm facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble  
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I'm going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) Are serving nothing but trouble

Heeeeey hey hey aye!
Heeeeey hey hey aye!
