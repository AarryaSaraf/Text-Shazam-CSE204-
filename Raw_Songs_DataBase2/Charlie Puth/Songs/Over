I heard you slammed the door
And fall right to the floor
You kept on crying
That look upon your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like this
Makes me wanna die

We'd lie beneath the stars
Just to foolish hearts
From million faces
Now I lie here all alone
Sitting by the phone
There's too much space here

Oh baby, come back and stay with me

Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
It's never over to me

My heart, my heart
Is your's, is your's
For yesterdays and for taking it
My heart is broken
You're all that I need
Just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me...

Cause letting you go hurt me

Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
Ever over you and me
