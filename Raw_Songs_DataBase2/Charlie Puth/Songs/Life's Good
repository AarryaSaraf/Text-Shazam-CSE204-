Have you ever felt like the world's not on your side?
It feels almost easier to lock yourself away and hide

Good thing that you didn't give up on me, you helped me get up out my head
So who knows where I'd be if you never said

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again

A thousand reasons made you fall
It's only a passing season, y'all
Why give up, let's give it up
For every minute of your life
Nothing's too late, it's a little delay
When life is sour, I'll be your lemonade

Good thing that you didn't give up on me, you helped me get up out my head
So who knows where I'd be if you never said

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again

Mama said don't give up
You have already come so far
Don't forget where you've come from
Who you can be and who you are

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
