I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
Yeah, it will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Yeah, why you gotta try so hard?
Counting calories and carbs
Another trip across the world
I go so hard tryna make you feel just like a queen
You don't need a camera to make a scene
You were born like that, no Maybelline
When you first wake up, you're bad to me

Pop another Addy, no sleep tonight
Can't push the wheel slow, I'm speedin' right
Over to the crib as we need to slide
But you take so long makin' up your mind
All-black dress, Dior bag
And leave ten times, I'll take you back
Why you wanna look like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Why you gotta compare our lives
To pics you see on your timeline?
Another shot of Hennessy
I try so hard not to act like a dick when I'm 'round your friends
Mood swings up and down again
Hollywood Hills where we play pretend
No one happy, but they're good at fakin' it

Pop up in the party, show face tonight
I don't really smoke, but I need the vibes
You love to get high, she need the flights
Standin' so high, swear she can fly
And just like that, you get sad
Let's go home, girl, this party's so wack
Why you wanna be like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling (Yeah)
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright (It will be alright)
Why are you so hard on yourself? (Yeah)
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Girl, when you look in a mirror
I hope you see what I see clearer
All that I want you to know is that you're perfect the way that you are
Oh, the way you are (Oh, the way you are), ooh
Oh, why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh (Yeah yeah)
Oh oh, oh oh...
