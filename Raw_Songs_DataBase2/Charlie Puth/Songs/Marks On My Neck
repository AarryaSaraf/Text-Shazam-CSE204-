All I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close, yeah

I should of never have, never have, never opened my heart again
Wasn't worth it
Why did I let you, I let you, I let you get all under my skin
Wasn't worth it

On the surface
You were perfect
But ya didn't really come to stay
Now when I look
In the mirror
I slowly watch you fade away

'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
Now all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close

I tried to cover it, cover it, cover it with foundation
Didn't help it
Try to get over you, over you, over you but you dug in
And I felt it

On the surface
You were perfect
But ya didn't really come to stay
Now when I look
In the mirror
I slowly watch you fade away

'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
Now all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
