Now she's gone
I'll turn my TB on
I should mow my lawn (No)
I'll turn my TV on
Write another song (No)
I'll turn my TV on
Hope it isn't long
Till I turn my TV on

So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV

All my tears are gone
When I turn my TV on
Nothing's ever wrong
When I turn my TV on
I should call my mom (Not today)
I'll turn my TV on
Hope it isn't long
Till I turn my TV on

So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV
So long, so long, so long, so long, baby
I'm watching TV
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, baby
I'm watching TV
