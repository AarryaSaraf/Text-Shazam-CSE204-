Big house, fast car, baby, you'll go so far
But not me
High wage, no kid, baby, you're free
But not me
Let a climate who's designing your heart
These days

Clown face, drag race, sleep alone in silk sheets
With no peace

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach

Fat check, white lace, baby, you're a disgrace
But not me
Bye, bye, sell, sell, winding up in hell
Don't come free
Doesn't matter, bug fat platter
Vacation retreat

Clown face, drag race, sleep alone in silk sheets
With no peace

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Playing ball for the coach
You filth fucking cockroach
