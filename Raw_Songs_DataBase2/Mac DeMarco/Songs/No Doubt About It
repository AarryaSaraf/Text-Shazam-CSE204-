It's not as though I choose my love
If I win or lose in love
Sharing one last dance with you is enough
It's not as though I tell my heart
If it can or can't be bought
Of path in love that it'll choose

It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You

It's sad to see your heart divided
Little use in trying to hide it
Sharing one last dance with you has proved
It's not as though I understand
Another day, a new demand
On the path of love, a heart will choose

It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You
It chose you
You
No doubt about it
You
