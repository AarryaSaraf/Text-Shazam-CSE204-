Thought she'd be coming back home, tomorrow
She wrote a note that she won't be
All of my tears have been borrowed
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

Think I'd tell her that I loved her, tomorrow
Hope that she sees things the same way that I see
I learnt to swim through my sorrows
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me

I only cry when I know that your eyes are on me
(Yeah)
I only cry, cry cry little baby, cry
(Cry when I know that your eyes are on me, mother fucker)
(Yeah)
