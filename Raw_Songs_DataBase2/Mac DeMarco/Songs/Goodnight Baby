Goodnight, baby
Lick the blood from the blade
Place the rose on the grave
Goodnight, baby
Baby, goodnight

Goodnight, brother
Wash the blood from the hands
Toss the gloves in garbage cans
Goodnight, brother
Brother, goodnight
Goodnight, brother
Brother, goodnight

Goodnight, mama
Hide the axe in the shed
Tuck the body in the bed
Goodnight, mama
Mama, goodnight

Goodnight, papa
Ditch the skin, keep the bones
Sitting there, on his throne
Goodnight, papa
Papa, goodnight
Goodnight, papa
Papa, goodnight
