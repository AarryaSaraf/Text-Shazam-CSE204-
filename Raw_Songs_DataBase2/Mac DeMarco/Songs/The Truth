She taught me to see it all
For what it is now
Made me believe in love again
Boy, it's been years now
But debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go, leave her alone
And keep my heart from the truth
The truth

She saw me how I believed
Nobody could now
I'm so relieved, or so it seems
Everything's clear now
The debts that I owe to my old days
Won't go away so soon
So I'd better go reap what I've sewn
And keep my heart from the truth
The truth
