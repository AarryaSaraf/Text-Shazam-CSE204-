Hope you had your fun
All those days are over now
The sunset's at the skyline
Say goodnight and kindly take your bow

March on, little doggy
March on, little dog

Hope you got your fill
All those days are over now
The river's all dammed up
So fill your cup and kindly take your bow

And march on, little doggy
March on, little dog
March on, little doggy
March on, little dog
