(Be quiet)
Check, yeah, uhhuh
Whatever
(One, Two, Three)
Yep

Drove out of town, just to see some stars
Out of my head, over how things are

Out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
Like out of my car

Drove to the church, my time to confess
Jesus was there, she looked really pissed

Out of my head
Out of my head
Out of my head
What a fucking mess
