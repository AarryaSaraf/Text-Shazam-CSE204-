Hey cowgirl
Hey cowgirl
Will you stay on the farm
Or will you come on back with me?
Hey cowgirl
Give up all of your stars to watch some TV
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
Try the big city lights for a little while
Hey cowgirl
Sure as hell ain't no stars down the dairy aisle
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
