A dusty old bear and cowboy boots
Snakeskin in the wind
A tumbleweed rolling down the road tonight
A storm cloud's coming in
Tired old horse lays down it's head
Soon it'll begin

Dream about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
Dream about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit

The sheriff sits back and shines his badge
What a dirty old pig he is
The navaho chief sheds a tear
Instead of flipping lips
A dusty old horse picks up its head
Soon it'll begin

I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
Uh
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
I sing about cowboy shit
Cowboy shit
