Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver has a metal
The metal has a trophy
A trophy is for bowling
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
Somewhere, there's a chair
The beaver's sitting there
Looking at that trophy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver's wife is grumpy
Because the beaver's lazy
But still loves him like crazy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
The beaver's baby is crying
The beaver's wife is sighing
But man, look at that trophy
Baby
Inside the beaver's dam
