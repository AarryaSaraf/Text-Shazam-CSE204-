Six feet, with the brown seats and the power windows
Light brown with a hundred thousand on the rodeo
Drunk space, now my new case come wherever I go
New wheels, waterproof seals at the wash and blow

Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota

Topped up in my new truck and we're hitting the road
Break down, not a chance to, not in this Toyo'
Night drive with the moon up at the passenger door
Drive a couple thousand then a thousand more

Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota
Proud, true Toyota

Toyota
