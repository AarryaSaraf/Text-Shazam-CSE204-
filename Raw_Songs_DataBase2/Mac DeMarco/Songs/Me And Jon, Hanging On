Sweetheart, wipe those tears away and let me love you, baby
Oh darling, come out of your cave and let me love you, baby
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh

It's just me and Jon, we're hanging on
Trying it out, singing our song
It's just Jon and me and all that we've seen
Trying it out, plain as can be

Sweetheart, wipe those tears away and let me love you, baby
Oh darling, come out of your cave and let me love you, baby
Oooh-oooh, oooh-oooh

It's just me and Jon, we're hanging on
Trying it out, singing our song
It's just Jon and me and all that we've seen
Trying it out, plain as can be
