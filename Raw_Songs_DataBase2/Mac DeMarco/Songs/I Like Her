I'd give the world to her
As long as my heart still beating
As long as she's next to me
As long as this love still fleeting

Because I like her

I'd kill in cold blood
I'd draw my own blood
Long as she's there beside me
Life could feel so good

Because I like her

Could it be make believe?
Am I just walking through a dream?
Haven't felt this way in
Such a long time, I do believe

That I like her
