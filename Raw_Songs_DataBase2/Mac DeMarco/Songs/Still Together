In time she'll see that her and me were meant to be together
And time will pass, it may go fast but we'll still be together
And where I go, she's at my side half of my life together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above together

Together, together

I've had my share, it's just not fair that we should be together
But if it's fine that I've done my time, let's walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know, we'll always go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above together

Together, together, together, together
