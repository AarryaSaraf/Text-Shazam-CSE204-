How you supposed to love her
When you can't look in the mirror?
Another empty bottle
Don't make anything clearer

You made the bed
Sleep, boy

Thought you said you'd call him
But his phone hasn't been ringin'
Thought it was your problem
It turns out you were just singin'

You made the bed
Sleep, boy
You made the bed
Sleep, boy
