// Cooking Up Something Good //

Mommy's in the kitchen cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go
Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go

Daddy's in the basement cooking up something fine
While rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight chewing nicorette

Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go
Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go

// Dreamin' //

Someday I'll find her and I'm still reminded
Maybe she's best in dreams, she's still the best I've seen

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, baby, I'm dreaming

Out on her windowsill baby remember
Maybe I'm out of luck, maybe it's running still

Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, baby, I'm dreaming

// Freaking Out The Neighborhood //

Sorry, mama, there are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry, next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

And I know it's no fun when your first son
Gets up to no good, starts freaking out the neighborhood

Really, I'm fine, never been better, got no job on the line
Sincerely, don't worry, same old boy that you hoped you would find 

And I know it's no fun when your first son
Gets up to no good, starts freaking out the neighborhood

// Annie //

Annie knows when it's me
Knows how I'm feeling and gives me her healing
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

Annie, daddy won't let me
Daddy won't let me go and that's why I feel so low
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

// Ode To Viceroy //

Viceroy, early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in and open up my eyes
Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner, already running dry

And, oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause, oh honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Viceroy, don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down just trying to keep it cool
Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner, I'm leaving it to you

And, oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause, oh honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

// Robson Girl //

Maybe when we're older we can try this over
Loving on the sidelines another one of my kind

Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy

No one else's shoulder, I felt could be colder
Loving on the sidelines just one straight on my mind

Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy
Robson girl, sit down by your daddy

// The Stars Keep On Calling My Name //

Honey, the stars keep on calling my name
But don't worry, I've told you again and again
When I'm down, you're always the first one to know
Skipping town, I'll take you wherever I go

And I just wanna go, I just wanna go

Honey, this town's really taking it's toll
But don't worry, I'm all through with feeling this old
When I'm down, you're always the first on my mind
Skipping town, let's get out and see what we find

'Cause I just wanna go, I just wanna go
I just wanna go, I just wanna go

// My Kind Of Woman //

Oh baby, oh man
You're making me crazy, really driving me mad
That's all right with me, it's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me just the two of us

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby, show me your world

Oh brother, sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired, really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me, I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me wherever I go

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby, show me your world

// Sherrill //

Getting hard to remember, getting hard to recall
Getting laid off and pushed out and it ain't my baby's fault

So if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill

Getting laid on the lifeline, getting tired, time for bed
And there's no use getting worked up, I'll remember all you said

And if you go, don't cry, I'll be right there at your side
Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill, Sherrill

// Still Together //

In time she'll see that her and me were meant to be together
And time will pass, it may go fast but we'll still be together
And where I go, she's at my side half of my life together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above together

Together, together

I've had my share, it's just not fair that we should be together
But if it's fine that I've done my time, let's walk the line together
And when she's low, I'll always know, we'll always go together
It's easy love, fits like a glove from up above together

Together, together, together, together
