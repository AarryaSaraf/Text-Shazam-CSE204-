Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been a while but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See, I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
'Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flyin' away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away, mm-mm
See, I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh, yeah
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

I know I'm askin' for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow (Let it snow) in California

I'll even settle for rain
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah
(Let it snow) Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
