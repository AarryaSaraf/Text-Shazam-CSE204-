This ain't no competition
At least, that's not how I see it
You know this ain't how it's 'posed to feel
And not after what is it, nineteen years?
Well, I hope you smile
Whenever you see me
I might be lovin' you from afar
And when you cry, and when you feel lonely
I hope your tears dry before they fall, oh

I'll be on your side (On your side)
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain (After the rain)
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it

(Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm)

I think about the moments that we had when we didn't fight
And the times you'd never listen to a fucking thing I'd say
And remember all the secrets that you told me only?
Well, I'ma keep 'em here with me
No matter what, I'ma keep 'em safe with me
And, don't let anyone take advantage of your kindness
Or that precious heart
And don't forget that you bad as fuck
And you deserve the fucking best (Mhm)
Promise whatever you're looking for, I know you're gonna find
Just use your wings girl, and fly (Fly)

I'll be on your side (On your side)
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain (After the rain)
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it

(Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm)

Oh yeah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
