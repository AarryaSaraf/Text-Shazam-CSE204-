I don't wanna be, to be alone, baby
Unless I'm alone, unless I'm alone with ya
'Cause it won't be, 'cause it won't be
'Cause it won't be, 'cause it won't
I hold you close, I hold you close, darling
The way that I used to, the way that I used to
'Cause it won't be, 'cause it won't be
'Cause it won't be, 'cause it won't

There's people on the sidewalk, there's music in the air
Everyone is smiling, I'm wishing you were here
To put this smile on my face, the way that you used to do
'Cause all I want for Christmas, is Christmas time with you
I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just wanna hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home

I don't wanna be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just wanna hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

Sitting by the fire, I'll hold you in my arms
Keep from the cold night, you'll be safe and warm
We raise a glass together, to love that never dies
I'll be spending Christmas, looking in your eyes
There's no better time to be together
There's no sadder time to be alone
Hurry back and please come home
Stay with me and make my dreams come true

I don't wanna be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just wanna hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
Unless I'm alone with you

I don't wanna spend this time without you
I just wanna hold you close to me
Kiss beside the Christmas tree
Baby, say you'll be coming home
Coming home

I don't wanna be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
I just wanna hold you close for Christmas (Hold you close for Christmas)
The way that I used to do (The way that I used to do)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be (It won't be)
I don't wanna be alone for Christmas (Be alone for Christmas)
Unless I'm alone with you (Unless I'm alone with you)
'Cause it won't be Christmas (It won't be Christmas)
It won't be Christmas
