Every day I'm grindin'
I don't even get a weekend
I been livin' my life in black and white, no sleepin'
So tonight we're gonna flip it
Like in a New York minute
We're gonna hail a cab and don't look back once we get in it

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty in pink champagne, let 'em know our names
Screamin' so loud, they'll hear us in L.A.
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy)
Poppin' like pink champagne

Make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like

We don't need no guest list
Yeah, everybody's invited
I'm sayin' even if we can't get in, we'll dance outside it
We're gonna make this bubble
We'll carbonate some trouble
When the life gets flat, gotta take it back to another level

Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up
Lemme hear you say, ooh, ooh
Can't keep it bottled up

Make it pop like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty in pink champagne, let 'em know our names
Screamin' so loud, they'll hear us in L.A.
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy)
Poppin' like pink champagne

Make it pop like (Like), make it pop like (Like)
Make it pop like, make it pop like, make it pop like
Make it pop like (Ooh, hey), make it pop like (Ah)
Champagne

Make it pop like pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty in pink champagne, let 'em know our names
Screamin' so loud, they'll hear us in L.A. (Woo!)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy, champagne)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ooh) (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Poppin' like pink champagne

Pink champagne in the purple rain
We're gonna paint, paint, paint the city
We're gonna show off all our pretty
Pretty in pink champagne, let 'em know our names
Screamin' so loud, they'll hear us in L.A. (Woo!)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ayy, ayy, champagne)
Poppin' like pink champagne (Ooh) (Ayy, ayy)
Poppin' like pink champagne
