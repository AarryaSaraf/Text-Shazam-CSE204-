I got weak and I just decided
I would check on you, say hello
It's been so long about six months
Since we split the harmony you went solo
I went partying, had the time of my life
Too young to cry a little
I swear I've been fine
I just wanted to hear your voice
But that's okay, though, say

Tell me why you expected me to miss you
Trust me I've been holding up
Tell my gut, stands corrected
It's official, we feel better broken up
And just friends (just friends)
But your attitude is like you suffering (suffering)
Then the voice in my head jumps in (jumps in)
I am clear, thank you for nothing

I guess that's why I wanna thank you so much for this clarity
Your participation in my new found bliss
I never knew that life could be effervescent
