I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas

Wanna show you in so many ways
Three-hundred sixty-five days
I'll give you all my presents, boy
I'm for you, not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice, I'm by your side

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah-ah

I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice, I'm by your side

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah-ah
