Higher... uh-huh

Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Crazy, what we're doing: living, letting go (Go, go)
Riding, having good times and no one has to know (No, no)
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

It's only been a minute since you came in
And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, mmhm
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, oh yeah
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, uh-huh
We got that jam, make them dance
Make them lose their minds, yeah, yeah, yeah

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher
