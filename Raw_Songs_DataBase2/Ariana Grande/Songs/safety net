You know you're really something, yeah
How'd we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back

You're making me forget my past
Never thought I'd feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track

I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind

Tripping, falling with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time, or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling with no safety net


Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl (Oh)
It's time for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry store and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts (Ooh, yeah)
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out (Ooh)
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day


I've never been this (scared before)
Feelings I just (can't ignore)
Don't know if I should (fight or fly)
But I don't mind {I don't mind, I don't mind}

Mmm {Sheesh, woo}
(Tripping, falling, with no safety net)
Boy, it must be something that you said (Something that you said, {said, ayy})
Is it real this time or is it in my head? {In my head, oh, in my head} (head, yeah)
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net


(Yeah)
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
{Every time you} feel some way, feel a way
{Never let} me run away, {run away}


{Girl, you got me} (tripping, falling, with no safety net)
With no safety net, {oh-ah}, baby
Boy, it must be (something that you said) Something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Is it in my head? {Is it all in my head?} Oh, baby
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net 
With no safety net


Oh hey
Ah yeah
