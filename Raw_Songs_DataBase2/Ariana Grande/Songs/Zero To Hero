Hercules

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O.
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that

When he smiled, the girls went wild with ("oohs" and "aahs")
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie, brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?

Who put the "glad" in "gladiator"?
(Hercules!)
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
(Hercules!)
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!

Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
(Hercules, Hercules)
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, (and the nicest guy)
Not conceited
He was a no one
(A zero, zero)
Now he's a honcho
(He's a hero)
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeed
