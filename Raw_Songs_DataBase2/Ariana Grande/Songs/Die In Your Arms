Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back

Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Yeah, yeah
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

Basically I'm saying here
I can't live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah
Ain't no need for contemplating
Promise you won't keep me waiting
Tell me baby I'm all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

If I could die
(I'mma make you believe boy)
I wouldn't mind
Ay, ay, ooh
Don't stop baby, no no oh!
It's what you do to me, yeah
Wooh, no no no no no no
