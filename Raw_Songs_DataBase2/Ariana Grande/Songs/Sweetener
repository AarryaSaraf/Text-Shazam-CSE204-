To bring the bitter taste to a halt (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

And then you get it, get it, get it, get it (Ayy)
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it (Ayy)
Flip it, flip it, flip it
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it
Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it
You make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)

I like the way you lick the bowl (You lick the bowl, sheesh)
Somehow your method touches (Sheesh!) my soul (Sheesh, touches my soul, yeah)
It lifts me up to heights unknown (Ayy, sweetener, sweetener, sweetener, sweetener, sweetener)
So when they ask, "How's life?" (Sheesh!) I go (Sheesh!)

When life deals us cards (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Your mama sent us horoscopes (Us horoscopes, {sheesh})
Had so much fun watching them unfold ({Sheesh}, watching them unfold, {yeah})

And then we lay it back, talk the rest of the night
Things that we can light make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
Talking 'bout what you wanna do, whether it's wrong or right
I am followin' you 'cause you make me say oh (Sheesh!), oh (Sheesh!)
(Hey) Said I don't know what I'd do without you in my life (ayy), it'd be so sour (Sweetener, ayy)
I'm hoping that everybody can experience what we have in ours (Sweetener, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy, sweetener, ayy, ayy, ayy)
