I saw the cover and judged the book
I turned away without a second look
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you
I told myself I better run and hide
I never noticed what was there inside
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you!
And I can't stop myself from lovin'
Ev'ry itty bitty thang you do!


Hoo! I see a brand new you
Hoo! I see a brand new you!


I didn't know where I was meant to be

I figured no one would be
There for me
But now, now, now
I see a brand new you!


Oo-hoo


Now, now, now
You! You!
I see a brand new you


I never knew that you could understand


But I looked up and you
Reached out your hand!
And now, now, now
I see a brand new you!


I opened my eyes
And there's a great big world around!
I opened my eyes
And just look, just look
Look at what I found!


Now, now, now!
I opened my eyes!
Ooh
I opened my eyes!


Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na


Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na na-na-na na-na-na-na
Hey
Yeah!


I opened my eyes
And there's a great big world around!
I opened my eyes


I opened my eyes!
Ooh
I opened my eyes!


And just look, just look
Look at what I found!


Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you. Hoo!
I see a brand new you!
