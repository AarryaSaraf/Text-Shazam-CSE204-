It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see
Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

Not to be annoying, not to be annoying
But I wanna keep it going
It's like a epic poem except the letters growing
Punctuate it with the moaning, it's so real

You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

And it's unconditional
On top of everything, hey
I cannot make this shit up
On top of everything, it's so real

Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay

It's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see
Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

Chapter never closin'
It's like a brand new mornin' every moment it's reloadin'
Not sayin' that it's frozen in fact
It is explodin', when your hand and mine are holding, it's so real

You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

And it's unconditional
On top of everything, hey
I cannot make this shit up
On top of everything, it's so real

Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay

The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
Do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay
