The days get long, start dragging on
They're out to get me
I contemplate the path of fate
Can't let them get me
I lost the feel, it turns surreal
Don't let 'em get me
The consequence remains in suspense
Ain't gonna get me!

They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Society is against me
They're out to get me
To serve and protect? Yeah. What the neck?
Can't let them get me
They persecute but I dispute
Their right to get me
Not innocent but in my defense
Ain't gonna get me!

They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Ain't gonna get me

They call it reason, I call it lies
They call it reason, I call it lies
Won't let 'em get me
Pure hypocrites all full of shit
Can't let 'em get me!
Ain't gonna quit so deal with it
Won't let them get me
Now fully grown my anger's blowing
Ain't gonna get me

Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me

They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Society is against me
