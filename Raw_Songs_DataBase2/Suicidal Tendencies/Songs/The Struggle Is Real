Shattered minds, shattered dreams
It's never ever what it seems
Staged random for more questions than clues
Carefully camouflaged just to confuse

How does it feel
Hey, no, oh no, why no? Cause the struggle's real!

Actions shout, lunatic!
Same results, still doesn't click
Heart is racing, brains like mush
Still searching for another rush

Hey, no, oh, why no... How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
When the struggle's real!

And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
How does it feel?
And we say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
This struggle is real! The struggle is real!
Pedal to the metal, got no brakes
Close my eyes, raise the stakes
Seeing things I shouldn't see
Wishing this was an anomaly

Hey no, oh, why no
How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
Cause the struggle is real!

Actions speak, war by words
Trampled by the sonic hurds
Questioning how I feel?
Don't waste your time, this struggle's real!

Hey, no, oh, why no... How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
When the struggle's real!
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
How does it feel?

And we say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
The struggle is real! This struggle is real!
