All I ever hear is nothing
All I ever feel is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

No sense to me, it's just another rhyme
I try so hard but I just waste my time
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get is to wonder why

I'm on the path, the cradle to the tomb
And all the way that's where my anger looms
All I want to get is something better
All I even get is a lie
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get

All I ever get is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All you ever give is nothing

All you ever do is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All you ever give is nothing
