// Self Destruct //

[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

Sometimes I wish my head would just explode!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I need the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop the urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self-self-self, I wanna...
Self-self-self, I gotta...
Self-self-self, I'm gonna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
I fight the urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Where is the sunshine of my mind?
There is no sunshine in my mind!
How can I be everything to everyone?
Where is the sunshine of my mind?
When I don't want to be anything to anyone!
There is no sunshine in my mind!

I just wanna make the pounding in my head freakin' stop!

Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, self destruct!
Self-self-self, I wanna... self destruct!

I can't fight this urge, to self destruct!
I can't seem to stop this urge, to self destruct!

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self destruct!

I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't fight this urge to self destruct!
I got the urge to self destruct!
Can't stop this urge to self destruct!

[guitar solo]

Self destruct!
Self destruct!
Self de-struct!
Self destruct!

// Su Casa Es Mi Casa //

The ticking you hear is your life passing you by...

Do you feel you're not taken serious?
That your input is brushed aside?
That you can get no respect
That people may even be laughing behind your back
Does this make you question your self-worth?
Well it should... because you're worthless!
Now take the case of the new-age cyco
Confident, commanding respect
Taking whatever he wants, from wherever it is

I've been thinking, so to speak
Knees are shaking, tired and weak
I've been wondering, who I am
I've been wondering where I am

Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco

If you have one, I'll have one too
Not another, the one I took from you!
Add my numbers, add it up
I guess I got it... give it up!

Su casa es mi casa, porque estoy muy loco

Now you've had some time to think
Why don't you look in the mirror, tell me what you see
Nah not on the outside, look inside, deep inside
The true ugliness
Not the self-created coloured hair, piercings hanging out everywhere
The stuff you try to cover up and deny
So there's a reason for everything
Now you let the reason out
Rising up, I feel it coming, let 'em know it's time!

I'm still wondering, why I am
Coughing up blood, spitting up phlegm
So much anger, hostility
Biting and kicking, inside of me
I'm fully cyco, partly hexed
Makes me wonder, who is next
You need not worry, about what I am
But you better worry, about where I am!

Su casa es mi casa
No quieres chingar conmigo

The ticking you hear is your life passing you by...

// No More No Less //

No More No Less
It takes more than A just making a fist,
It takes more than just getting pist
You gotta make your stand and resist
You Gotta Resist or You'll cease to exist
No More, No Less

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best

How can you see what I see
when everybody's coming down on me
How can you twist the list
and expect me not resist Ha ha ha
How can you explain all the pain
that goes terrorizing my brain?
Now you'll face a man that understands
that violence is the best plan its cyco time again!

[Chorus]

No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
We're taking what we deserve,
Ain't setting for second best
No more No less
No more No freaking less
No more Not a Penny less
No more No Less!

How can you call it cheating
if we're too smart to get caught
Come on everybody
let's show them what the fuck we got
Its time to get cyco
let's tear this mutha out
Anytime, anywhere, without a doubt, we're gonna take you out!

// Free Your Soul... And Save My Mind //

[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

December 27th, 4:30 in the fucking morning. Sleep? Ain't no fucking sleep here, not with all these fucked up thoughts bouncing around in my fucking head, destroying every fucking thing it touches. Yea, this shit's been going on too long, but it's all coming to a fucking end, right now!

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that lives in you
Is breeding inside me too!

Free your soul and save my mind
I'm begging you to be so kind
There's so much power in your frown
Your sadness just brings me down!

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When I ain't got your back!

Free your soul and save my mind
You wish you were dead, I feel like I'm dying
If this is the price you pay for love
I feel sorry for God up above!

Free your soul and save my mind
Everything I can think of I'm trying
What does it take to make you listen?
Can't you see your soul is missing?

What you gonna do?
If they won't give it back
What you gonna do?
When there's no turning back
What you gonna do?
If you can't get it back
What you gonna do?

So what you gonna do?
So what the fuck you gonna do?

Free your soul and save my mind
Look in my heart and you will find
All the pain that breeds in you
Is fucking killing me too!

Hide behind your emptiness
Your soul is buried in an abyss
To make room for all the lies you believe
Your goodness is forced to leave

Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...
Free your soul and save my...

Free your soul and save my mind!

[guitar solo]

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...
Free your soul and save my mind!
Free your soul and save my mind...

Free your soul and save my mind!

// Pop Songs //

I hate Pop Songs
They think they're clever, I think they're wrong
I hate bubble gum punk
They got the look but the music is junk

I hate anyone that savors
The foul stench of this months flavor
And hell is a place that you can go
If you like disco or techno

Pop songs
Pop songs
Pop songs
Pop songs

Hi boys and girls
come on and get happy

I hate Puff Daddy
And his friend the dead fatty
I hate the grateful dead
But I'll be grateful when the rest of them are dead

I feel like I'm on pins and needles
How many bands can rip off the Beatles?
And every day there is another
Band that got big by playing a cover

I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs
I hate pop songs

lala, lala, lalalalalalalala

I hate Celine Dion
Titanic Song makes me wanna moan
And if I hear another love ballad
I think I'm gonna have to toss my salad and

I hate teen idols
they got signed by old farts with fancy titles
There's nothing worse at least to me
Than stupid lyrics with a lame ass melody

I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs
I hate pop songs, pop songs

Pop songs, I hate pop songs
Pop songs, I hate pop songs

// Bullenium //

[Mike Muir / Mike Clark]

[guitar solo]

Give me back the beat...
Bringing back the beat...
Give me back the beat...
Give me back the beat...

My tears, a declaration
Emotional perspiration
Denial, another dead end
Admittance, it never should have been

I got to get away!
I...
I got to get away!
I...

Bring me back the beat!
How did I get this monkey on my back?
Bring me back the beat!

Heartbreak, it's what I plan on
Regret, faithful companion

I got to get away!
I...
I got to get away!
Bullenium...

Gotta-gotta-I got to get away!
I...
Gotta-gotta-I got to get away!
Bullenium...

Bringing back the beat...
Bringing back the beat...

The highs don't seem to get so high, but the lows can sure get low
The lies get more pervasive with the bullshit's steady flow
Bringing back the beat...

Another year has come and gone, but what has really changed?
You cannot put a price on the heartache that I've gained
Bringing back the beat...

I seem to be more accepting of the things that don't get done
And oh so quick to concede all the battles that should have been won
Bringing back the beat...

Oh Lord, please help me!
Here comes, the new bullenium!
Oh Lord, please help us!
We're in, the new bullenium!

[guitar solo]

Bringing back the beat...
Give me back the beat...

Bullenium!

Give me back the beat...

Bullenium!

// Straight From The Heart //

[Mike Muir / Mike Clark / Dean Pleasants]

Coming straight from the heart!

I got Sui pride flowing through my veins
That's the shit that makes you immune to pain
No matter how much crap you take day after day
It's never too much if you're living the Sui way

Coming straight from the heart!

I'm Suicidal, yea Suicidal!
I'm Suicidal, yea Suicidal!

Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
I'm Suicidal!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
I'm Suicidal!

I'm Suicidal!
I'm Suicidal!
I'm Suicidal!

I got some crazy thoughts screaming in my head
If I wasn't Suicidal, then I'd be dead
It's hard to hold back all the crazy shit that's inside
But I'm powered by my Suicidal pride

Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
I'm Suicidal!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
I'm Suicidal!

I got that Sui pride...
High on that Sui pride...
I got that Sui pride...
Riding that Sui pride...

Coming straight from the heart!

I'm Suicidal, yea Suicidal!

Ha ha ha ha ha...

Check your head, watch your back, define your enemy
Cause I'm gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, just you wait and see
What it is, what it ain't, and what it's gonna be?
Cannot be stopped by your confused fucking reality

Hold the lies, heal the pain, and that's just the start
I'm coming, coming, coming, straight from the heart
Stand up tall, head up high, yea, you got that right
Cause I'm Suicidal motherfucker every day and night

I got that Sui pride...
High on that Sui pride...
I got that Sui pride...
Riding that Sui pride...

Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!
Straight from, straight from, straight from the heart!

// Cyco Speak //

[Mike Muir]

Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to interrupt you from your listening pleasure. I'd like to have your undivided attention please, and please welcome the honorable mister Cyco Miko to the podium, thank you.

Thank you very much. I'd like to thank brother Clark from the Suicidal family for that fine greeting. Anyhow, I wanna jump in real quick, so we can get back to the music, it's jamming. I know you know it and I know it too. But sometimes you gotta go to that extra level, take another step, step back, and get a good running start on it. See, right now I have to get to a point, a point most people won't go because it's a little bit too close to the truth, and the truth isn't something that's gonna benefit them in the way that they want it to be. See, my dad told me a long time ago; "It's not what someone does, it's why they do it that really matters. And that's what you should judge 'em for." People can be the nicest person in the world, but that's only to get you to think they're nice, so they can let down the guard a little bit, and you're there, and then you go in their door, and they mess with your mind! Anyhow, too many people tryin' to get you to think the way they want you to think, what we say; is tryin' to get you to think, whatever way that may be, but to realize the way you're thinking may not be the right way and give it a little extra thought. So with that in mind, the question is; what do we do, why we do? Everyone's got a motivation, and sometimes you gotta judge just to see where that power's coming from, or where they're tryin' to throw it! See our motivation? Being in a band, what we're tryin' to get across, is this right here, that little extra level. You see, most people think they think, but they're not really thinking, so they stop thinking 'cause they thought they already thought, but they never did in the first place, so they stay on their little safety level! So I sit there and I say; if there's all these people so smart, thinkin' so good, how come every day in my life there's so many damn stupid people doin' stupid things? See, wise man once told me, he said; "Mike, there's two clubs. There's the stupid people and the smart people. Ain't nobody blocking the door at the stupid entrance, anyone can go there. But the smart entrance, is a little more exclusive." So where do you wanna belong to? The Country Club, or the Cardboard Shack? The penthouse, or the outhouse? Seems like an easy decision to me. So what we'd all thinkin' about right now is what we're talkin' about, what we're talkin' about is what we're thinkin' about, and that's the whole point; you should think before you talk! So where we're at right now is the place that we want to go. A little bit of help. See, every day, everywhere you go, people do stupid things. Three hundred and sixty five days out of the year, people not thinking. People that have the ability to think, that aren't thinkin'! So what we wanna do, is nominate one day, call it; "International DON'T-BE-STUPID Day". Now what this is gonna do, is be a little reminder, maybe we can wear a pin, maybe you could send a tape to somebody, and when they start do somethin' you say; "Wow-wow-wow, hold on there, partner! Today is "Don't Be Stupid Day", so you can't do that!" So what we want you to do, is just take out 24 hours out of your life, think about all them dumb things that you'd just go right ahead and do, when you know damn well you wouldn't want anyone else to do it, if you really cared about 'em. So start caring about yourself, start using your mind, and as we say; start you brain...

// Got Mutation //

I got mutation baby...

I'm sinking inside a dream
Cemented in make believe
I'm pointing, why can't they see, have you got mutation baby?
The demons inside a tree

So have you been mutated baby?

I got mutation!

I'm blazing unchartered paths
Challenging the ghosts of the past
Confusing the sacred oath, I got mutation baby!
Antagonize the caustic host

Mutation!

I got mutation!
I got mutation!
I got mutation!
I got mutation!

The essence that anger builds
The terror that knows no guilt
Sensation that has no bounds, have you got mutation baby?
When the spirits all make the rounds

Have you got mutation?

Yes, I got mutation!
How do you make, how do you break?
Yes, I got mutation!
How do you break, how do you make?

Have you got mutation?

How do you make, how do you break?

Hey Charlie Monroe
I want you to know
You are my hero

I was so blind
Till you gave me a sign
You opened up my mind

Charlie Monroe...

Now I can see so clear
Left behind all my fear
Following the voices I hear

From Charlie Monroe...

My life is, bad break after bad break!
My life was, mistake after mistake!
But then you, you taught me how to let go!
Thank you, Charlie Monroe... a modern hero!

Hey Charlie Monroe
I sent you more dough
I need your help bro

I've hit another wall
A long and painful fall
Why won't you take my call?

Charlie Monroe...

Times shouldn't be this tough
Life shouldn't be this rough
Why won't you bail me out?

Charlie Monroe, ex hero...

[guitar solo]

The time has come!
The time has come!
The time has come!
The time has come!

Oh, silly me, I forgot you don't speak backwards
Well let's just say; you're in for a big surprise, ha ha ha ha...

Wake up Charlie Monroe
How quick the times can go?
You reap what you sow
Goodnight Charlie Monroe

You're the worst kind of dope
A sad pathetic joke
Give me the lynching rope
Where's the tree and the rope?

Awake for your wake, your wake
You sick pathetic fake, sick fake
It's time that you should know
You're dead, Charlie Monroe

Enjoy what you got!
Death to the despot!
Charlie Monroe is dead!
Long live the new Charlie Monroe!

[Mike Muir / Dean Pleasants]

[guitar solo]

To feel the sun when the sky says rain
How can you explain?
Can you explain?

To feel your lips when you're not there
But I don 't care...
I don't care...

You make the water taste like wine
When you're on my mind...
Always on my mind...

[guitar solo]

It's been so long and I've gone so far
I don't know where you are...
Tell me where you are...

But in my thoughts there is a mist
Do you even exist?
Do you exist?

Do you even exist?!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I've lost my way and I want to get home...

Home...
Home...
Home...
Home...

I've wondered lands so full of sin
I can't even begin...
I won't even begin...

I've read the book and prayed at church
And still I search...
But I still search...

And I'm still searching!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I'm scared and lonely and I want to go home...
I'm so tired and I need to get home...
Won't you please help me find my home...

Home...
Home...
Home...
Home...

There is a void inside my soul
And it's taken its toll...
It's taken its toll...

At night I stare off into the stars
And I don't know how far...
Is it really that far?

Home...

I can hear your voice such a calming sound
I've come around...
Are you around?

And when I sleep I'll dream of you
And what I'll do...
When I get back to you...

If I get back to you!

[guitar solo]

If you find me take me home...
I'm scared and lonely and I want to get home...
I'm lost confused, where is my home...
Won't you please help me find my way home...
If you find me take me home...
If you find me please take me...

Home...
