// Master Of No Mercy //

Fuck it!
He's a carrier of death, a stork in reverse
He blesses you with sickness
Cause love is a curse
The arsening in your Koolaid, the bomb in your mail,
He disappears in motion
But leaves a bloody trail

Drop to your knees, humble you pray
But can't put off your judgment day

There's a knock at your door, who could it be?
You got a new friend that's gonna set you free
He's making a list, he's checking it twice
No amount of money's gonna stop this vice

No mercy, no mercy, no mercy. You want mercy?
No fuckin' mercy! Oh no
With the wink of an eye, a snap of the finger
Now the smell of death is all that lingers
A doctor of death with a PhD, a specialist in pure misery

See you fucked with him even though you knew
And now your worst nightmares all come true
You scream and shout you beg and plead
But he's got your soul and that's all that he needs

He's the master, master of no mercy, no mercy, no mercy

// Just Another Love Song //

Well I just had to turn off the radio
But not before I heard thirteen songs about love in a row
Well I don't know what the next song's gonna be
But I know how the words are gonna go
They'll be singing "Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby I
love you so"
So won't everybody sing along cause her comes just another
love song

I need you like I need a hole in my head
I need someone to steal my money and wish I were dead
I need someone to always put me down
And everywhere I go she wants to hang around

Do you really even think dreams come true
Do you really even think you'll find something wonderful and
new
Do you really even think someone's waiting for you
Do you really even thiink that love is near
Do you really even think it's me dear
Do you really even think I want to hear-but I still say
I won't fall in love today

I need a chick who's got expensive taste
Who's not afraid of whose money she wastes
You expect me to buy you a diamond ring!
Well I suspect I'll buy you not a thing!

Well I could tell you you're the only one I love
And how your eyes sparkle like the stars above
And that I carry a picture of you in my heart
And as long as we live we'll never be apart
And that you're the most important person in my life
But I can't handle a girlfriend, how am I gonna handle a wife

Love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate love-hate
love-hate love-hate
I love, love, love to hate you but I'd hate, hate, hate to
love you

I could promise all my love to you
But that would take me only a second or two
And if you're waiting to be my one and only
You're gonna find out what it's like to be awfully lonely
Your song was alright for awhile-But now your tune's gone out
of style

You want to cuddle and hug all night
But I'm going out with my friends tonight
And I don't need someone to act like my mother
I already have one-I don't need another

But she sure looks fine
After a bottle of wine
And she's out of sight
When my mind's not right
And I'll promise you anything dear

// Waking The Dead //

Kept in the guard of Mother Nature's womb
Resting in the safety of their tomb
Sheltered by six feet of soil and rock
The spade is the key with which their gate we'll unlock
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied

So we wait till the stroke of the midnight hour
Then we'll unleas the darkest of power
Hell's gates will open a new judgment day
Now is the time that the dead will pay
Why should they be resting so peacefully
When we're up above in pure misery
I don't care that they've already died
That's not enough to make me satisfied
Waking the dead, waking the dead, waking the dead

All rise!
Hell's gates open the earth trembles and shakes
Now their pardons are over they pray for their mistakes
Mausoleums firebombed now rage in flames
When the dead come out their bodies we'll maim

Rob-Robbing their graves stealing their bones
Bang-Banging our heads to their screams and their moans
Fix-Fixing the wounds that even time cannot heal
Soon-Soon we will know how good it feels

This is not damnation or an act of God
Now the dead they rise ripping through the sod
Purgatory has to wait, but how can this be
The dead are free-the dead are free!

Waking the dead-you said that it wouldn't be
Waking the dead-You said that we wouldn't see
Waking the dead-Now the dead stand before our own eyes

Silence is blaring the earth opens wide
History repeats, reburied they die
Darkness descends through nature's pores
They return to their sleep on earth's basement floor
Now they rest not so peacefully
As they've had a taste of our misery
I didn't care that they'd already died
That wasn't enough to make me satisfied

Return back to their tombs now they lay
This is no game for the novice to play
Repeat not a word lest ye be forewarned
The punishment of Hell's darkness and scorn
Repeat not a word of the sermon said
A prayer for the dead, don't play with the dead
Don't try to comprehend what's going on
You can't understand, please don't understand

Waking the dead-And we'll be
Waking the dead-All rise now
Waking the dead-We're gonna wake the dead
Waking the dead

I said the words what have I done
I thought it cool, I thought it fun
The words I say they start to change
The syllables now rearranged
A language I can't comprehend
I shut my mouth it doesn't end
The bowels of nature open wide
I cannot move I cannot hide
I can't believe the things I see
The dead are free, the dead are free
I close my eyes and pray it's not real
Their presence close coldness I feel
What have I done Lord please forgive
Once they died, but now they live
I wake the dead, I wake the dead, I wake the dead, I wake the dead!

Cleanse the lepers
Cast out the demons
Wake the dead!

// Controlled By Hatred //

I see the world it slips so far away
Looking back on yesterday
Leaves me nothing more to say

Terror reigns my world, Lord please tell me why
I'm on my knees, I start to cry
I live my life, that's another lie-Controlled by hatred

It feels good, I'm not proud to say
But I'll just put off my guilt, it can wait another fuckin'
day

I search you out and now you're right within my reach
And now you'll learn a lesson only I can teach
Now I'm choking it, now I'm checking out
Now I start to scream, it's what it's all about, shout it out

Can you see what it's all about, shout it out
Now you know what I'm all about

So you can chalk up another soul that's lost
Calculate the social cost
You know not what's inside of me
Raging mad insanity

Scrambled brains I got a toasted mind
Look in my heart therein no goodness are you gonna find
I turned my back to all responsibility
I got no place for all your sensitivity
Now I'm checking out, now I'm checking in, now  I star to pray

Just another fuckin' sin, why can't I ever win?
Seems like I never win, it's a sin after sin after sin
Why can't I ever win?

Who am I?
I feel no pain

I close my ears and now I see so clear
I slip away just left all fear
Not a sound, but still I hear-Controlled by hatred

And now the world it slips so far away
Looking back on yesterday
Leave me nothing more to say-Controlled by hatred

I didn't think that I could ever try
Now tears of joy I start to cry
I free my soul and now I fly-Controlled by hatred

The hooterman goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"What's your name?"-he goes
"You know my name, you know my name!"
What's your name?-my name is terror!
What's your name?-my name is pain!
What's your name?-and you're my reason
I'm controlled by hate, controlled, controlled by hate
My hate

It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
It's gonna gotta gonna gotta gonna gotta get better
Now the world, my whole world's controlled by hatred
The world, my whole world's controlled by hatred

Who am I?
I feel no pain!
Could it be?
I've gone insane. Controlled by hatred!

// Choosing My Own Way Of Life //

My life
People don't try to tell me how to live my life
Don't try to fill me up with false hopes and lies
Show me the truth they say they'll show the light
Don't try to tell me I'm wrong when I know I'm right
Cause I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is
Choosin' my own way, choosin' my own way of life

I'm mad as hell and I ain't gonna take it
And if you think I am I think you're fuckin' mistaken
Lock me in, but you can't lock me out
You can cut off my tongue, but I'll still scream and shout

Choosin' my own way of life-what up?
Cause I'm choosin' my own way of life

I'd rather have a penny than a heart of gold
I'd rather die young than do as I'm told
I was never one to turn down a fight
I gotta sleep all day so I can rage rage rage all night

Hell I don't need it, I don't need it, all I need is
My destination is my own decision
Living fast is my only religion
Trust no one cause I'm no fuckin' fool
Learn on my own I don't need no school

Choosin' my own way of life-what up
Choosin' my own way of life-straight out
Choosin' my own way of life-ain't it my life
Choosin' my own way of life-and I don't need nobody else

// Feel Like Shit... Déjà Vu //

Don't you tell me that I'm dreaming 'cause I've been here before
But that don't mean that I want to be from here anymore!

Cause I feel like shit-but who are you to say
I don't know I had to have a right to feel this way
I feel like shit-time after time
So don't be trying to tell me it's all in my mind
I feel like shit-but you don't really care
Except my God he used a four letter word in there

I feel like shit-what am I to you?
I feel like shit. Deja vu!
And when I feel like shit, I feel like shit!

I feel like shit-I'm sorry to say
Do you fuckin' think I like feeling this way
I feel like shit-what do you expect me to do
I feel like shit, deja vu!

This ain't my imagination
Lost all thoughts and concentration
Time goes on day after day
But still If feel the same fuckin' way!
Feel like shit, deja vu!

Always feeling out of place
Hiding behind a smiling face
There just ain't no pretty words
Can't you see it fuckin' hurts!

You know I feel like shit-deja vu
Feel like shit-deja vu
Feel like shit-deja vu
And when I feel like shit I feel like shit

// It's Not Easy //

Easy easy, it's not easy
To say what I feel when nothing seems real
Not easy, it's not easy
To be someone's friend when the pain it never ends
Not easy, it's not easy
To keep up the fight when nothing turns out right

Easy I got to take it easy, I got to take it easy

Easy it's not easy to open your heart when love's torn it
apart
Easy it's not easy to hold your head high when you want to sit
and cry
Easy it's not easy to fall on your knees and say Lord help me
please
Easy I got to take it easy, Oh please, please, please easy

Easy easy it's not easy
Gotta gotta take it easy
It's not easy
It's never easy
