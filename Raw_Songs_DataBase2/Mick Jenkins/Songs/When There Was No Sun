Okay I speed off then I'm done
I will not turn behind my sons
I cannot
When there was no sun
I found a
Another source within
Repeat
Speed off then I'm done
I will not turn behind my sons
I cannot
When there was no sun

You only body build 'cause you afraid to feel cardio
Thru my appeal she feel that it was sacred
Wait lets take it slow before I blow
Then adios
At least I kept it real
Ten toes concealed
Audio Repeat

You only bodybuild instead of healing other sections underneath
I put a fill inside perfection
And that's when rejection speak
Note it brief, keep peace
And light order if not with me
I'm borderline of the peak of your favorite nine rappers least,
Put the coordinate, order this mic,
In spite laughter of the audience
They kept lacking so I combo'ed em quicker than CNN
Can't never know to make amends
Or blow em out the park so out of wind
And struggle oxygen far long my forgotten friend

Okay I speed off then I'm done
I will not turn behind my sons
I cannot
When there was no sun
I found a
Another source within

Speed off then I'm done

Soon as we link it's time to smoke up
You best be vocal, this ain't no shelter pot don't choke up
You cannot hold us, the gas the only think we cough up
The A1 octive, you know we low key had to boss up
A spades a spade we ran to Boston blew the block up,
My nigga back up, best know the flavor tryna clock us
Sit back and watch us, we moving this shit like it's rocked up
Shoot like Rocky, when he was Rambo got the pocky
A box of sticks, we at the Ritz Waltz through the lobby

I know you see me can't even copy nigga
Okay I speed off
Then I'm done
I will not
Turn behind my sons
I cannot
Where there was no sun
I found a
Another source within
Repeat
Okay I speed off then I'm done
