Oh, It's a gnat in here
Get out of here gnat
Got something you want to tell me gnat?
Cuff my nuts, place myself on house arrest
Locked in, judge, jury, bailiff, bet
When it rains I'm dry
Sun shines I'm wet
Push up demons fuck it doing bout 50 11 sets
Ignoring your texts like sweet babies who cry in the church
Oh if your partner got popped yesterday and school comes first
My favorite colors yellow maybe cause I'm yellow
And I got so much styles it's probably cause I'm ghetto
My mommy never cooked a cosby dinner
And often times I took a L for Mrs winters
But I'm getting off the subject
Off the boat got my luggae but the quote
Pack light styarts to echo through my mind
So I'm rushing now hushing now
Laid my suitcase down like prom night zipped it open started pulling out starting tossing memories socks, thoughts who pretend to be, boxer briefs, pants, pictures of frenemies killing me to make room, room, room, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things
Thought I bought a rollie but forget that I don't need it
Just let that holy water wash over my caesar dressing like that thursday in november
Know that they'll remember style, boil it then let it simmer down
We blowing smoke between the breeze
The twists are sengalese
No more backwoods blown we? of memories
We wired the intricacies of our logic
No hand in my pocket
Still got my hand on my weapon
He more malcom than martin a bit more baldwin than both
Need a cauldron for mixing a black man's soul into soup
So many? can't cope
You cracking jokes 'bout the soap
We more concerned with the truth
You niggas burning the booth these niggas burning the wick at both ends
Fade to black I'm ghosting in the light
Lately I been waking up at night trying to beat the day
Over confident I can't be issa rae
Make room, room, room, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things
I know what I know but you heard what you heard so you poked your head in got suspicion confirmed
Been on my feet for miles so my soul got some burn
Still its fuck how you feel on my bottle of pills
If you can't hold me down then you don't get the time
Yea yea Fame is less work nothing sacred no more
Either take what you want or you make what you earn
If I kill you I promise I'll pay for you first like oooh
If you love me grease my scalp with this 380 in my lap like oooh
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Use the answer to relapse, for the light
Lately I been sober
Chasing new highs
Cut the cord to my bungee
You can be yourself don't be shy
Take your time don't you rush things
