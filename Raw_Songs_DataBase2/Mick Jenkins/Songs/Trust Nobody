Running to tomorrow like fuck my actions until I run into tomorrow
I called the captain, he was sinking in a bottle
I called the captain, he was sinking in a bottle
And off the record I said dude get it together
Almost launched ya
I sure hope my last night operation as my favourite xan effect
Like if I don't remember nothing then I got like no regrets
I been dodgingfamily madly play around with death
You want call four fouls, I'm still paying off the ref
I'm still sticking out my chest, poppa said I'll get respect
That ain't work, million dollar smirk when charm take their work
Now respect don't mean shit, ain't worth my spit mixed in the dirt
That ain't work, million dollar smirk when charm take their work
Now respect don't mean shit, ain't worth my spit mixed in the dirt

I ain't got a lot of time to waste with these motherfuckers
You one hunnid in my space or you slow my pace, two face
I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace, yeah
I ain't got a lot of time to waste with these motherfuckers
You one hunnid in my space or you slow my pace, two face
I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace

I got devil horns, she got angel wings
When I fuck her got her singing up to heaven's gates
North Face bitch, I'm ready for an expedition
Wrist all stupid in the winter and the boot missing
Used to have to re-up, now I got my bag
Fuck what any haters say bitch I'm in my bag
Knock him stone cold then I take his bitch for takeout
Rocking stone, looking gorgeous everyday now
Never taking L's cash rules everything around me, yeah
I don't need a pill to fit in my surroundings, yeah
Mick brought the water, sip that in the club yeah
Money trees, bad bitches, more love yeah
Throwing bands like a quarterback
Switch hoes like clothes, leave 'em in the past

I ain't got a lot of time to waste with these motherfuckers
You one hunnid in my space or you slow my pace, two face
I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace, yeah
I ain't got a lot of time to waste with these motherfuckers
You one hunnid in my space or you slow my pace, two face
I might have to pull it off the waist in this motherfucker
Get to spraying like it's mace
