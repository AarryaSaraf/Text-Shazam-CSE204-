How you gonna move when it's time to sign that dotted line
And you're no longer able to speak your mind
Fix your shit
Spend a bit switch your image
Cop a whip maybe a chain or two with the pendants
The rollie compliments it 100k to your dependents
Work through your agreement til you can say you're independent
But please do not get it twisted niggas forget that it ain't that easy
They'll do you greasy then hide their hands the shit is treason
Consecutive W's but executives fucking you
Industry sucking you dry tell me what're we coming to
Disingenuous energy from people you run into you
Cut them off the machine you shut it off
No telling what you'll come across going through the process
To become a boss these day you can't tolerate another loss
Disloyal jewelry your chain came with a double cross
But that don't hide the fact they see you as the underdog
Show them how to make it with art form
All could've been easy now you gotta make it hard for them
Before you leave the world let the people know it's all for them
Time is now either stand for something or you fall for them
Yeah

Ohh this is how I am
Ohh this is who I am

Ayo Keem niggas is looking for you man trying find out where the fuck you at
The fuck you been doing man
It's time to get this money nigga the fuck off your ass

I evolve
Never tried to hide my flaws
In this game you sink or swim
Fly or fall
Every bars a fire ball
Still cold enough to send a chill through your spinal cord
I'm the one the youngins and OGs get excited for
Power right inside my palm
This atomic penmanship enables me to write a bomb
Drop a song and wipe them all out
Long before the day they even see my final form
Hell will freeze before I conform high quality I perform
Silent storm how'd I keep it going for so long it's been a minute
Going strong for my niggas holding on by the thinnest piece of rope praying that I don't slip
The ones around me quick to say get a grip if ever I trip
I put my trust in them
Know I got way more than enough to win
This shit a race I'm leaving niggas in the dust again
A rush of wind when I get started
Promise I'll stay on it for my dearly departed they said I got it
But my shoulder bout as cold as my heart
I ain't felt love in half a decade
Headaches from stressing over my next phase in life
Same story I'm just working on my next page
The paper looking longer than an essay
Meanwhile I'm praying that all of my people make it in the best way
And live to talk about it the next day
Life is like a chess game
Say less more work less play
Constantly making sure that my head straight
Niggas be deadweight and bitches be deadweight
Everybody trying to get a piece of your bread wait
Once I hit the stage you gone see how this leg break
The whip got leg space
I left space in search of fresh state of mind

Ohh this is how I am
Ohh this is who I am

Aye
This truth still smoking
Chop the onion ain't no tears flowing
That dog in him he got years on them
That frog in him catch me in traffic
No hog in me y'all speak pig latin
That smog in me I still breathe easy speak easy
Moon shining on our wave these niggas drunk early
I'm jack hammered all my flows they seem to crack lately
Pat Swayze dancing dirty then I'm ghost on them
Rearview mirror is broke on them ain't no looking back
Touching souls we not just copping feels
For boutique go to Marshall Fields for department feels
Run a tight ship need loose leaf if you wanna talk for real
Just a young nigga making art for real
Touch a motherfucker heart for real
I pearl some wisdom all we needs a spark for real
No barber pole but shit is getting sharp in here
We cuttin up we know we bout to double up
Buckle up they say it get dark from here
