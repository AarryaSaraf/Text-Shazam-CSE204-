Money on my mind but those thoughts are fleetin'
Just a papercut but feel like I can't stop the bleedin'
100 flows fool, cruella couldn't spot my ceilin'
And I'm Spock with speakin'
Came with pro tools, no logic leakin'
I know the offense come from proper defense
Been breakin' patterns, know they lost the sequence
The last of somethin' we just not Mohicans
The first of nothin' we just got the blueprints
They way we comin' we'll have multiverses by the weekend
On to the new shit by the time the news hit
I take the old chips and buy the new dip
This shit is surfboard its not a cruise ship
The Open Sea just some deep blue shit
At foundation I found patience
I found actors no sound stages
Who okay'd to fake it till' you make it?
I can't take it, gotta remember this shit just the Matrix
Cant get complacent, had a mask on but I had to face it
AHHH

Illusion is my world
It soothes the strain
And moves me on
The truth is my alter ego
No fault in being honest
Honest honest honest

Boot up by my bootstraps, these avatar heels
Got me runnin around for new laps,
Like did anybody get through that?
Who got the plug, I am the plug
Unplug me for a minute G
I got the disks and all the games the players on this grid could need
Please, Breath
Or these things you want are truly what you need
See look the code is green
My bands are broad my land is odd it's in the metaverse
But I've been runnin round in cyber circles just to stretch the Hertz
Connect to church so we can praise the gods
My net worth is hogtied to horseshit don't step in dirt
I got some problems that I've yet to search
Solutions downloadin' in severed verse
If you can see these walls then get the clerk
They'd want us down here kept and hurt
And extra burnt no lessons learned no blessing birthed
I'm tryna find myself in terabytes of terrorism
Eccentric exorcisms Saturation heads are spinnin'
This consciousness is just a weathered prison
YUH

Illusion is my world
It soothes the strain
And moves me on
The truth is my alter ego
No fault in being honest
Honest honest honest
Honest honest honest
