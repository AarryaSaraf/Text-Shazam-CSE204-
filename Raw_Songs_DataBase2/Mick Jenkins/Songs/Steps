Ugh

I could give a fuck about a chain
Need a chance, need some change
Fuck a dance
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
Like to look at pictures out the frame
Got no chance in this game
Out your lane
I'm gone stay right here with my two step
With my

I think I could make her pussy backflip, aye
She could hold her water like a cactus, aye
I don't wanna take her 'round the atlas, aye
I just wanna fuck until my back ache
One step, step back bitch I'm a spectacle and I'm proud
This pedestal is where berettas blow but I'm not the man to take down
They finna milk the boy the minute that I come across as any type of cash cow
I got a pill addiction that I'm trying to kick, but when I kick the bitch kick me down
One step forward, two step back
Don't stress when they press the metal to my neck
I'm gold little boy the medal on my neck
Deflower women I got a meadow in my bed

Taking steps to do right by you
Taking steps to do right by you

With my two step
I take one step at a time
With my two step
I take one step at a time
With my two step
I take, hey
One step
One step at a time

I think I could make her pussy backflip, aye
She could hold her water like a cactus, aye
I don't wanna take her 'round the atlas, aye
I just wanna fuck until my back ache (I-I)
I gotta switch up my mind set
I don't got nothing but time, bet
Taking a step at a time, yes
Better myself, feel it in my chest
Now let me digress
I been away from the topic
I'm overwhelmed and I'm godless
My fear of god is ironic
It's pulling teeth in my conscious
And I don't know an orthodontist
Young hemophiliac
Blood over water but I downed in Cognac
Never get a rubber when I get to rub the cat
Irresponsible, but fuck I'll place my bets

Taking steps to do right by you

Fuck boy called thinking that he real cunning
Told me "can you check if your refrigerator running?"
Don't waste my time, I'ma see you when I see you
Then I made him run the freezer, bitch it ain't that funny
But I been writing my wrongs now
And I been trying to calm down
He put the gat to my face and I'm facing the fact that he won't put the gun down
Blow
That's crazy
Now my momma got one less baby
In the name of the "fuck you, pay me"
Thought you said that you would not betray me
Gave my spot away to get a bit of cash
I would died for you, man that shit fugazy

Taking steps to do
