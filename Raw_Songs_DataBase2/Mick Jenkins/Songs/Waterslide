Tweet tweet, Rockin' Robin wit it
Breathe deep, y'all be talkin' wit it
Sweet tea, sriracha ramen wit it
King me, got a problem wit it
I suggest you accept if you can't beat 'em join 'em
Anyone up on game be dem boys and
When the crabs in a bucket we just boil em
Everywhere you go, you can't avoid 'em be like
Aye aye, issa issa wave wave
If you make the grade grade, it'll get you paid paid
Goin till it's gone gone... we puttin' on on
Get that get that wap wap, this that nigga nod nod
Watch ya posture
Backbone
Flat broke
Sambo
Pack rows
Ipso facto
Know this yo last hope
Just cross tic-tac-toe
You lost then freestyle butterfly back-stroke

Hit this waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Drippin never dry (never, yeah yeah)
If you wanna ride (wanna ride yeah yeah)
Then you gotta climb (know you gotta climb)
Gotta put the work in (work)
Fuck the bullshit, all I hear is chirpin (chirp)
Better if you...
Hit this waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Bitch you know I'm right

I just try to stay authentic
Know a lot of niggas say they own it when they rentin'
Lemon when I bought it had to get the windows tinted
Lookin out them bitches all I ever see is gimmicks that niggas mimic
What's the intrinsic value when the lights around you just keep dimmin'
See niggas jumpin' ship, that just isn't how we swimmin', crushed linen
Fam is always gon' be wrinkles this shit ain't much different
Selfish denim know I'm cut different
Just know that I don't got no "I don't give a fuck" missin'
The thruth missin'
I spit it like a tooth missin'
Uncouth got the roof missin'
I just burst through the ceiling how did you get in?
Proof of purchase now whole crew got spent
For the okie doke you knew nothin
Had a big ass circle now you boxed in
Check me hula hoop with the shoebox blend
Low key hope you clocked in

This waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Drippin never dry (never, yeah yeah)
If you wanna ride (wanna ride yeah yeah)
Then you gotta climb (know you gotta climb)
Gotta put the work in (work)
Fuck the bullshit, all I hear is chirpin (chirp)
Better if you...
Hit this waterslide (waterslide yeah yeah)
Bitch you know I'm right

We don't stop we wit it on a work day
Party like a college on a Thursday
Cleanest water every day is earth day
I know what to get you for ya birthday
Play to win I want it in the worst way
Need a strategy the game is turn based
Cleanest water every day is earth day
I know what to get you if you...

Hit this waterslide
Drippin never dry
If you wanna ride
Then you gotta climb
Gotta put the work in
Fuck the bullshit, all I hear is chirpin
Better if you...
Hit this waterslide
Bitch you know I'm right
