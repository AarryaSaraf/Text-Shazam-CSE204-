Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
Lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine
Where my niggas at
Making something of themselves placing bigger bets
We got bigger fish to filet we ain't laying up
Don't give 'em that shit from the free throw, niggas fucking hacks?
Got the simulation glitching bitch we busting back
Now they leaning in to listen, got the baritone
Still a couple niggas drowsy off the  pack
I'm feeling energies I'm even peeping pheromones
I'm screening enemies like casting calls for Marvel flicks
Brought water to drink, brought water to gargle with
If it was salt water most at the surface like some snorkel shit
I'm in the dark water it's black and white just like the orcas is
Killing shit, Darth Vader even with the force
These niggas forcing it
Art paid us even with the failure, know I'm fortunate
Raw papers twisting up these joints, I'm no contortionist
Star gazer, look up at the sky and know it's more than this
Piss on niggas flows I'm Mr. Porcelain, please pardon me
Salt shakers for the seasoning it ain't no salt in me
Sharp razors in my company they not just ornaments
Far greater with my niggas, what's the coordinates

Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
It's a lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine

I was hotboxing the stain back at the gang way
I been chain smoking no chains just shorty namesake
I been lane switching I ain't switching the frame rate
Iron chef cooking you can't stay in the same kitchen
Whip it left handed my aim steady I can't sway
Bass clef branded they know that I keep it low key
Eight packs legend I can't stress it enough though
Nigga born from pain, I remember when I would hit purp up for that quarter thang
Got that bullshit off my shoulder like a halter top
 the type of nigga to cop Baltic ave
Been picking up the type of shit I ought to drop
On my Andre shit I might just go and grab a flute
'Cause flipping your shit for the mob is how they often flop
I gave 'em water and I heard someone talking flutes
A noble savage I can turn into Chernobyl if I drop this nuke

Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
It's a lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine
