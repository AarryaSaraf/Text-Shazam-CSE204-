Sometimes it's just bout the fit
I need my shit with a taper
I can't quit I'm too legit
Dropping jewels niggas dying off the vapor
Needed paper I got paper need a stapler
I got habits I got problems got enablers
Peep the patterns picking swatches switching flavors
Sometimes that shit just not it
I need the real fuck the cap'n
I need An accurate description of what happened
A? look like them boys relaxing
What you stand on in them nikes I'm just checking
I respect the lighter flexing fuck a hypebeast
Niggas characters so often they come typecasted
Eddie murphy I ain't really lacking no character
Don't try to compare us
Its apparent we lacking in parallel
Just said what I said my nigga pklease don't try to paraphrase
I had to come off the carousel
Niggas is still on they high horse
Ain't gotta do nothing by force
Right handed nigga play high keys
Taking my talents to hockey
Flows is too icey somebody stop me
Sometimes niggas can't do shit
I'm watching mother fuckers copy
Niggas use stencils niggas ain't banksy
Backbone like number two pencils
I peep it eaerly niggas should thank me
Can't fuck with you cause of who you with
Sometimes it's just bout the fit
I need my shit with a taper
I can't quit I'm too legit
Dropping jewels niggas dying off the vapor
Needed paper I got paper need a stapler
I got habits I got problems got enablers
Peep the patterns picking swatches switching flavors
Sometimes that shit just not it
I need the real fuck the cap'n
I need An accurate description of what happened
