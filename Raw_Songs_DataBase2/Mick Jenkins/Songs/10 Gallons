And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just
I ain't ever


Look at how a death affects you
Now I got two straps, ambidextrous
Homie got blew back now I'm next up
Mick and I two step, straightened your chest out
I been inside of the kitchen
I don't need any permission
Unless shawty tryna' get pipe
'Cause that be my bitches decision
I don't want no Margiela or Balenci's
You could not offend me
You could only push me to the edge and find lead from the end of my 50
Bitch I'm with the wind, see
Pop a motherfucker like Jones no Quincy, ugh
I been on the hunt for the Benjies, bruh
'Cause every thing that glitter lets me feel it in my soul
Big bro got popped and I pray for his soul
I feel less human when I sit back and morn
But it makes me feel something
I'm little bit torn on the topic
Corn on the cob
When you flow I'm appalled, homie stop it
Apostle of God with a god complex and I know y'all mother fuckers catch these optics
These op-op


And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away


And I'm back with a black mask
Anybody tryna brah-brah take a cat nap
I don't want to take another tablet of acid
I don't want to have another panic and flash back
Blood's thicker than water
I starved with my men, now we split up the lotto
And I could never cave, take a bitch to the grotto
And fuck 'til my dick hurt
"Distract me" is my motto
False loyalty to people
Where reciprocation is weak
My seven deadly sins, might occupy the whole week
I felt I owed her my life
For helping when I O.D
'Til Cherry told me "homie, you would do the same shit for me"
And that's true as fuck
My bitch green obsessed but got the bluest blood
And my burgundy soul's polysporin in the cut
And the water of the womb grows thinner than the blood
Spark up the cannabis
Bitch I'm intimate
I don't feel shit since bro got killed
And all of these pills really helping me handle it

Drop dead weight, it's water
Keep me away from the alter
My body is morphing and changing a lot
But my soul is the part that dont alter
Drop dead weight, it's water
Keep me away from the alter
My body is public and up for the taking
My soul is the part I don't offer


And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away

And I'm on ten
And I got a ten gallon water for squad
I'm a hit that bitch one more again
And I got tints all on my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
And I got homies I miss that died
I dont want to feel that shit again
And I hotbox when I'm in my ride
I ain't ever hiding just plotting on a run away
