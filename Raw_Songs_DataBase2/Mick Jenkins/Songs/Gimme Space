Yeah, I don't think you really who you say you is
You ain't really who you, who you say you is
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know
Look, If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma make it then
If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma gimme, gimme
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know

Before I caught a red eye, you could bet I caught a black one
You bring them toys out, better not be no cap gun
This ain't IG, niggas wanna expose your heart, they just gon' tap once
There ain't no Maybelline for make believe
My barber took a vaca, you could still come catch a fade with me
I'm Coach K. on bad days
I make the call, you wait and see
I'm not at all coy, I'm James Fauntleroy in rooms with ya'll noise
Step in that bitch, like what's the call boys?
Lil' niggas want buzz so bad, they drinkin' tall boys
I put my shooters on, ya'll can't assist me
Chris Paul voice
Pistol Pete of grippin' pens
I ain't ever aim and miss
I ain't know what famous is
I'll show ya'll what dangerous is
Niggas tried to take my life
Then they want to take a flick
I ain't even lace my kicks
Still made triple threat movements
My stutter step got 'em sweatin', don is a threat to 'em
My bread and butter bring envy, hunger and stress to 'em

Yeah, I don't think you really who you say you is
You ain't really who you, who you say you is
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know
Look, If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma make it then
If ya'll don't gimme space, I'ma gimme, gimme
I don't think you really know what dangerous is
I don't think you really, really know

These niggas done pissed me off
I'm off the top with all my moves
See any nigga actin' hard, I bet the iron switch him soft
I switch the safety off
Spit 32, he caught a mean one
Trigger finger crazy wild, the witness say she heard machine guns
Now we playin quidditch

I'm trying to catch a snitch
Fuck a cat and mouse I'm at this bitch
Don't run your mouth bout Mick
I'm from out south, I made it out that shit
22 in this Gucci pouch, you think my outfit slick
Goofy, now gimme the loose-leaf or you lose your coofie
Don't act fishy unless you raw as sushi
This ain't the movies but
Shit get spooky, I call slime ghoulie
Pull up with the tooly
Turn your fruits to smoothies
Double back and turn your smoothie soupy
Same shit over and over, all you niggas loopy
My eyes be on the skies, I feel like Snoopy
Told my homie scoop me, pulled up in a hoopty
Pulled up on some monkeys
I be with gorillas like a fuckin' zoo
Keep bitches bad and boujee
Niggas tame but still unruly
You could fuckin' sue me
And you will
When a off-duty shoot me 'cause he moody
And it's truly hate
