Uh!
Give a fuck if your pockets low
We been living lowkey
Wonder how we was poppin' bottles
This far below the poverty line
Won't no avocados but toast was on me
Early
What break-fast was hopping gates
Would do the same to Pearly
Mistakes add up
Some niggas could name the police
Some niggas always need somebody else name on the lease
Some of us struggling to find inner peace
I'm still fightin' a beast
I show love
I definitely wanted requited at least
The odds stacked against shorty
And despite that she preach
While I'm smoking my roach
Nigga been tree huggin' tryna widen my reach
More Vitamin-E
Really tryna widen my scope
They tryna tell me
My freedom abides in a vote
That died on a boat
So on that very water I choke
Most times I get tried for I speak
I die for I spoke
I cried when I seen
But
Never ask why 'cause I know
They give a fuck if you fly
We 'sposed to fly or sell dope
We 'sposed to give em' the key
So they can get in the door
Still had to kick in the door
Just to get in the door
When he was five
And we gon' call that boy a thug
For the rest of his life
Damn

Yea you know I walk through
Everything they taught me
Still feeling groggy
Heavy on the caffeine in my coffee
No Geoffrey
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly
Folk don't get to see themselves too often
Only look at mirrors through the smoke
Everything go rogue
Everything's costly

I fear no evil at all
I pray my closest don't fold
I know somebody gon' fall
Fuck saving face I can't keep changing pace
To stay up wit' yall
This ain't a race
See niggas running in place
To chase waterfalls
I can relate
I can't erase the times when I dropped the ball
Was tryna handle it all
I'm no Kyrie in the least
I had to learn it the Hardaway
Niggas Penny's be creased
A couple niggas deceased
I watched some niggas retreat
You ever had a peace treaty wit' niggas you still don't fuck wit'
I started turning my cheek
I had to turn a new leaf on niggas
Smoking swisher sweets
Was on them backwoods for some weeks
Then I got straight to the paper
My paper straight as a crease
Got paper weights for receipts
Got label mates we been scammed by the same man
We don't speak
The neighbors hate we don't speak
Don't come through preachin'
Just come through practicing' whatever you was gon' preach
And scratch my back if you reach
Gotta match my joint if you smoking
These niggas will do you like leeches
I'm seeing ghost like it's bleach
I brought my sand to a fire hydrant
Created a beach
I put my sole in these beats

Yea you know I walk through
Everything they taught me
Still feeling groggy
Heavy on the caffeine in my coffee
No Geoffrey
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly
