Aye, put me on
Put me on
Put me on

Aye, put me on frontstreet
We done did enough sneaking through the back door
We done grew enough roses from concrete
I done stamped up two whole passports
I done hopped in my motherfuckin' Jansport
Niggas grown till it's time to communicate
Niggas grown till it's time to apologize
Niggas smoke like you trying to fumigate shit
You know roaches will live through anything
I thought vultures would wait till a nigga die
These birds can't wait till a nigga breathe
Swear to god I hate when a nigga lie
Especially when I gave you my energy
Can't rent space in my head, tryna enterprise
New whip, butterfly tryna pollinate
Bi-coastal, the truth tend to polarize
I find globally lies tend to dominate shit
Gotta say it to my face when you come in mine
Gotta put it in the air if you blowing smoke
Better win a Golden Globe if you running lines
Running deep, got layers like artichoke
Check it, don't speak on my name if you summarize
Came way too far, you gotta say it all
Didn't wear it on the surface, it was underlined
These days gotta put me on frontstreet
No cut scenes, just the one-shot
Call it Clifford, got the red in the front seat
And the loud turn heads like a gunshot
Bullshit stop flows like a blood clot
No, I don't stretch my stories, no bungee
Break bread when a nigga, get hungry
We can all ride like I'm in the humvee

Doubt that, nigga, put me on frontstreet
We done did enough sneaking through the back door
We done grew enough roses from concrete
I done stamped up two whole passports
I done hopped in my motherfuckin' Jansport
Niggas grown till it's time to communicate
Niggas grown till it's time to apologize
Niggas smoke like you trying to fumigate shit
You know roaches will live through anything
I thought vultures would wait till a nigga die
These birds can't wait till a nigga breathe
These niggas let a whole groupo of kids die
Government can't tell me anything
Bitch look straight in my face then tell a lie
Think I'm gon' give up my energy
But you no longer dealing with beginner me
These days gotta put me on frontstreet

(These niggas let a whole group of kids die)
Gotta put me on frontstreet
(Bitch look straight in my face and tell a lie)
Aye, put me on
(But you no longer dealing with beginner me)
Put me on
Frontstreet
