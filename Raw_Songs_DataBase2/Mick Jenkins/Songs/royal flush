You my everyday of the week
I see our next hand in your eyes
A royal flush
We don't gotta speak too much, uh

And when you're ready
We can play 'em
And if you love me
Don't play face down
When you're ready
I'm all in
And if you love me
Don't play face down

You're my prize, I don't show off often
Can't bring you to the parties 'cause they all start bussin' in my ends
Mmm, I love 'em, but you just something different
Meet my mama and my cousins
Got me outta character too soon
'Cause I know you look good in a black suit
And I know you think about these things too, don't lie
I don't wanna rush it 'cause we got time, mmm uh

And when you're ready
We can play 'em
And if you love me
Don't play face down
When you're ready
I'm all in
And if you love me
Don't play face down
(Don't play face down)


Let's call a spade a spade
I think I got the hands for the games you play
Flop the nuts, now it's training day
You want the turn for a change of pace
I know the river be my saving grace
I sipped your water but I can't shake the taste
I'm on tilt, it's no paper chase
I'm more built, drop the ankle weights
I'm on stilts, fuck the low-key shit
Had high hopes when I came your way
A royal flush and we exchange and face, like


And when you're ready
We can play 'em
And if you love me
Don't play face down
When you're ready
I'm all in
And if you love me
Don't play face down

And when you're ready
We can play 'em
And if you love me
Don't play face down (Yeah, yeah)
When you're ready (When you're ready)
I'm all in
And if you love me
Don't play face down
(Don't play face down)
