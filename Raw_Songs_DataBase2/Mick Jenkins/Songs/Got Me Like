Every day, keep on analyzing
Every day, keep me satisfied and I know
I can be wrong but you move in silence
I can be wrong but you keep denying

Tell me what I want to know
Don't leave me alone
Don't run away my love

Yeah, you got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (La)
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)

Just like nicotine, you're a fiend fiend
How you leave when I'm all you need?
Honestly, got me tripping, falling super speed
Would you listen? Got me begging, please, but

Would you love me, would you let it go?
Would you love me if nobody knows, knows, knows?
Nowhere to go, go, go, go, go, go

You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
You got me like, you got me like
You got me like, you got me like
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La)
La, la, la, la, la (La)
(La, la, la, la, la)

Uh, uh
Pistol whip-like grip that shit is tight, you caught me slipping
Just complete the mission, I was not supposed to stay
Still the fastest break, a nigga appetite, it's different
Thought that I might call, I didn't know what the fuck to say
Usually speak in sway, you spoke in my tune
I was so amazed, I was running away
That shit was tsunami, kamikaze, I deplane
No you not insane, I just can't explain

You got me like, la, la, la, la, la
(I just can't explain)
La, la, la, la, la (Ooh)
(You got me like)
(You got me like, you got me like, you got me like)
You got me like, la, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
(Mm, la, la, la)
