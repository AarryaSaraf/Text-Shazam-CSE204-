// The Valley Of The Shadow Of Death //

Uh!
Give a fuck if your pockets low
We been living lowkey
Wonder how we was poppin' bottles
This far below the poverty line
Won't no avocados but toast was on me
Early
What break-fast was hopping gates
Would do the same to Pearly
Mistakes add up
Some niggas could name the police
Some niggas always need somebody else name on the lease
Some of us struggling to find inner peace
I'm still fightin' a beast
I show love
I definitely wanted requited at least
The odds stacked against shorty
And despite that she preach
While I'm smoking my roach
Nigga been tree huggin' tryna widen my reach
More Vitamin-E
Really tryna widen my scope
They tryna tell me
My freedom abides in a vote
That died on a boat
So on that very water I choke
Most times I get tried for I speak
I die for I spoke
I cried when I seen
But
Never ask why 'cause I know
They give a fuck if you fly
We 'sposed to fly or sell dope
We 'sposed to give em' the key
So they can get in the door
Still had to kick in the door
Just to get in the door
When he was five
And we gon' call that boy a thug
For the rest of his life
Damn

Yea you know I walk through
Everything they taught me
Still feeling groggy
Heavy on the caffeine in my coffee
No Geoffrey
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly
Folk don't get to see themselves too often
Only look at mirrors through the smoke
Everything go rogue
Everything's costly

I fear no evil at all
I pray my closest don't fold
I know somebody gon' fall
Fuck saving face I can't keep changing pace
To stay up wit' yall
This ain't a race
See niggas running in place
To chase waterfalls
I can relate
I can't erase the times when I dropped the ball
Was tryna handle it all
I'm no Kyrie in the least
I had to learn it the Hardaway
Niggas Penny's be creased
A couple niggas deceased
I watched some niggas retreat
You ever had a peace treaty wit' niggas you still don't fuck wit'
I started turning my cheek
I had to turn a new leaf on niggas
Smoking swisher sweets
Was on them backwoods for some weeks
Then I got straight to the paper
My paper straight as a crease
Got paper weights for receipts
Got label mates we been scammed by the same man
We don't speak
The neighbors hate we don't speak
Don't come through preachin'
Just come through practicing' whatever you was gon' preach
And scratch my back if you reach
Gotta match my joint if you smoking
These niggas will do you like leeches
I'm seeing ghost like it's bleach
I brought my sand to a fire hydrant
Created a beach
I put my sole in these beats

Yea you know I walk through
Everything they taught me
Still feeling groggy
Heavy on the caffeine in my coffee
No Geoffrey
I ain't tip toein' that's too costly

// Things You Could Die For If Doing While Black //

I just wanna smoke my weed

I just wanna speed one time
I wanna do VIP one time
I just wanna speak my mind
I just wanna post my bail
I ain't even do the crime

Might wanna ask a question
Might call the police for protection
Might wanna protect myself
I just wanna help myself
I might need meds myself
Just one caretaker to tell you I'm sick if I can't take care of myself

I just wanna love my girl

Wanna throw a lil rice (yea)
Wouldn't that be nice (yea)
Just wanna smoke my weed and love my girl

// Stiff Arm //

I keep dripping over these flows
I keep the stiff arm, you too close
Swiss army knife I keep like seven different type of bros
At least two keep a pole
At least 3 from the streets
I know Five live by the code
Savages in the fold
Halogens on bright, y'all know slime heavy with the smoke
Grind heavy tony hawk
Hands on, do it manual more [?] in my walk
Kick push all the hoes, no Fiascos I'm Spock
No tobacco just weed
Too much Tabasco, I'm hot
This shit is Hasbro, all games
I cannot dap up no opps
I keep a stiff arm, don't tweak
I hit the heisman on beat

I keep rolling up I just smoked
Fact is some niggas just weeds
Fact is some niggas gon' grow
Fact is some you don't need
I keep the stiff arm, you too close
Too many hands on this blunt, too many
Too many words left unsaid
Too many times left on read
Too many times watched you front, too many
Too many hands on this blunt

It's too many people I don't know
Too many hands in my face, in my pocket
Shit gets out of pocket
You gotta watch it
You gon' learn this shit
If I only had my left eye I might burn this shit
I digress, it's only sage and this is burning shit
[?]
And it's too many heads in this bitch, boy
It's too many heads on this blunt, too many
Too many heads on this blunt, too many
I keep a stiff arm, you too close
I keep a swiss army knife too
(I keep a stiff arm, you too close)
(I keep a swiss army knife too)
(I keep a swiss army knife)

[Ayinde Cartman:]
A few thousand pounds of what the fuck now
Y'all scared we gonna pick up the pace and trample our way out
Y'all gonna make us pop the trunk and trample the whole town
Unstoppable together so we plucked from the crowd
The hot topic tossed around that no one talks about
A 10 feet tall issue in plain view
Our existence is the elephant in every board room
How we larger than life and lurking in the shadow?
How the lion the king when I can slap him with my nose?
Take our plant base for weakness
Stay preying on our soul
Bring up what y'all did to us and now the schools uncomfortable
Y'all can ban critical race theory but it's the bedrock of your homes
We easier to muzzle when we made to feel alone
A huge burden when you way too much
Thick skin with a sensitive touch
Can't shrink, don't mean it don't hurt
Enormity, it's a gift and curse
We gon' wait for recognition or flip the conference table first
Their fear or ours, ain't no telling what's worse

// Contacts //

Tell you how I feel inside
They say it ain't trill enough
They say it ain't drill enough
I'm coming from the illest side
I just know it's real enough
Fuck what niggas think of that
The salt is pink, the ink is black
The grass is green, the link is broke
Flowin' like the sink is broke, the drip is so consistent now
Watch him grow complicit, oh you flipping now?
Shit hit different, I need scissors now, cutting ties
Taperfading with' no clippers, don't ask no Kawhi's
Turn stone cold, you get to fucking with' my Oberweis
Stretching out, my shoulders wide
All my burdens boulder size
Mama right off Bouldercrest
I was right off 63rd, you know the vibes
Archetypes and prototypes, I know those guys
Press me, I could go get my shit notarized
Instantly, no polaroid's
Instantly, I'm Jonah, y'all gon' have to throw me overboard

Couple nights in the belly of the beast
Nigga came out like he know the lord, overjoyed
I don't understand
When is y'all niggas gon' realize, uh
Real eyes realize real lies, huh
Real eyes realize real lies, help me see the truth

Tryna be more James, I walk in Peter shoes
Sparrows gotta be my views
Vintage frames I see 'em through
Fear of God, I'm steppin' in, no weapon formed, the needle move, the record scratch, the blessings pouring
Almost like I'm preapproved
For everything my credit good, my checking strong
My breakfast good, I'm shredding wheat the tears is gone I'm back in form
Overhead just like my baggage I unpack it for him
Don't exaggerate I'm accurate this javelin throwin'
Tryna get my point across
Olympic preparations all these habits form
Elevated patterns, I can taste some pH balance off
Went against the wave but I'm no Hasselhoff
Ain't no more low-key I took the silence off
Old school but the mileage new
Seen it from the pilot's view
Gotta be more hands on it no way I get these calluses off
Skate grip, only 'cause they shape-shift
Famous for the fallacies
We been watchin' matadors
Y'all still putting batteries in niggas backs, empowered by they salaries
Should see 'em when the camera's off, you know the drill
Hear the wrong thing and then I'm Holyfield
Ha, help me see the truth
Tryna be more James, I walk in Peter shoes
Sparrows gotta be my views
Vintage frames I see 'em through

// Scottie Pippen //

I was trippin'
I was definitely trippin' now that I think back
I was bitter
No matter how I shoot, I'll never win it all
On my own, yeah, without you (Without you)
It's the same thing for me
I was trippin'

I was just used to that shit
It's like suicides at the practice, I was conditioned this way
You a brand new conditioner
Didn't realize that I was auditionin' though
Bring all of your big ambitions this way
Don't tell me no lies, I'm learnin' I'm missin' it, huh
You should recognize a nigga is different this way
Let's randomize, and way more intentional now
Goes all the way down to your hips and the distance they sway
I got the mirage and kissin' the lip-gloss you use
I count up the freckles and all of the dips in your face
Nothing can touch that joy
Bit of better of your feet
I always sleep at your place

I been trippin'
I was definitely trippin' now that I think back
I was blue, I was crippin'
I was trippin'
No matter how I shoot, I'll never win it all
On my own, yeah, without you (Without you)
It's the same thing for me

You wouldn't entice the young man
Your voice was nearly enough to suffice at that time
That isn't likely these days
You know what I mean, we sacrifice for this love
I know for sure it's not overprized over her
And that's not to say it wasn't expensive as fuck
That's not to say we didn't roll a dice over here
Scratchin' our head, it wasn't no lice
Just real life committed to her, all of her vices would clear
She committed to me despite the advices we heard
We thought it was sweet, it's not over wives over here
Feel like a mail bird, a pepper dice for a year
Still we throwin' rights over here
We both have walls up so high
Reachin' new heights over here

I been tripping
I was definitely tripping now that I think about it
With the crew, I was different
Eyes were red
I was bitching
Bullshittin
No matter how hard I shoot
I will never win it all, on my own, without you

// Gucci Tried To Tell Me //

Lost in the sauce and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
I got no facade, I can't change the course
A titanic lost, if we lose this vibe
I'm no Randy Moss, but I'll catch ya feels one day
Smoking trees I planted
Smoke in peace, she painted
Lost in the sauce

I find myself in all your crevices
Heaven sent, don't gotta wonder why you levitate
It's evident your pull is actually gravitational
When I switch up, pray you pick up on this gravitas
My tongue will twist my heart a kamikaze
I make these statements 'cause they bona fide
Won't blow my high, but damn consistently I'm blown away
Flow shit your way, whole time I'm tryna have you flewed out
Bump Ella Mai, I see us boo'd up
She stole my soul must be in blue suede shoes
I'm in her Kool-Aid, she got the juice, I call her Kool G
Don't leave the crib we catching blu-rays
Blend it well we sipped a smoothie
King, it's just a Tuesday
Won't hesitate I'm sure as Al B
By her side or in her shadows, that's where I'll be

Lost in the sauce, and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
You know consistently I'm blown away (away away away)
You got me good
You got me gone
Wasn't even smoking stoned
Wasn't even smoking strong

Lost in the sauce, and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
You know consistently I'm blown away (away away away)
I got no facade, can't change the course
A titanic lost, if we lose this vibe
I'm no Randy Moss, but I'll catch ya feels one day
Flag on the play I'm moving on?

Lost in the sauce

// D.U.I. //

Influence (must be)
Niggas want me on the board now (trustee)
Just in case they can't implore you they'll nudge me (tuh)
Influence (must be)
Influence (must be)

Who you follow, who you needing? (trust me)
It's gon' show who you believe in
Influence

I hear them talkin' but I ain't concerned, nigga this patience
The streets teach you how to wait your turn what you in a hurry for
Death around the corner and they sell that shit at the corner store
Two for five nigga, fuck it free ninety nine
Whole bird on a flight how I flee from a crime
You and your crew peas in a pod
Put you in the same coffin
Keep Clorox you stained often
That shit you dropped was soft nigga, I felt it rain harder
I dropped the scope in the water
I'm getting high like my father
I catch a flashback every time it rock up
Some of my niggas gone some locked up
Remember when those was just lines from a song now it's my life
They say I lived it too long
What the fuck is a PTSD I'm D.U.I. with a Glock nineteen nigga

Influence (must be)
Who you follow, who you leading? (trust me)
It's gon' show who you believe in
Niggas still teethin', schemin'
Nevertheless I peep it
Never impressed the sequel is never progressive
How ironic, wasn't grown with hydroponics I clone bits and pieces
I own memories in my leaves
This nigga knew how to dress and now I'm all into clothes, but ain't no crease if I fold
Ain't no peace if I bleed
Connections I don't want, they telling me I need
They need me to say, or may need me to see, or may need me to tweet
And I may need two fucks
Say what I mean on these beats
Y'all read in between, y'all marvel at these flows
We keeping em clean
We keeping it authentic
Who need to be screened
Who really the fam, who really here to see and be seen

Influence (must be)
Why niggas who don't know me in my face saying they love me
Influence (must be)

// Speed Racer //

We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up
We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up

I'm tryna take off, me and my migos
La familia, my flows they on Danny Trejo
Better get familiar, my mind state on kill these niggas
Tryna kill these niggas, know the grind, paper, feel me
Nigga you don't feel me nigga, I need stages and megaphones
I need money, no advance, fuck a mega loan
I'm skipping rocks that I swear used to be my stepping stones
I'm stepping light like I'm on ice so none of my lessons clone
Please do not hate me 'cause you less informed
Thought it was one of those no-weapons-formed situations
Caught implications of other, that's why I'm on your line
It's not as simple as you make time for what you make time
You know me well if we FaceTime

We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up
We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up

// Truffles //

Sitting in my room
Then I did some shrooms
Now I'm on the moon

It was
Go yard totes
And Carhartt's tees
And art talk
The coldplay carpet
Round my feet
The dolce scarf is
Round my face
Forgot my mask

Fuck!

Fuck up her mood ring
Leaving the tri state
I'm on trip
Shawty don't trip
She know I come home with my plate
Smoke out the zip
Joint on my lip
I'm off a 8th of the truffles
Weight in duffle
Lose and come right like we played in bubble
Tear shit down play in the rubble
True shit we ain't saying Subtle

Niggas is leeches
Niggas is weeds dawg
Life ain't a beach (bitch)
This shit a see saw
Shit is egregious
Still slaves it's a secret
Still want the white man to tell you you
Prestigious
Rubbing shoulders with the demons
Niggas is tweaking

Aw hell naw
Here go another young nigha making trouble (yea)
Young nigga making trouble (wait)
Young nigga making trouble (huh)

Got paid now he eating in the chef kitchen
He don't want the truffles
Trees funkier than the truffles
Think they want me In a muzzle

Aw hell naw
Heres another nigga think he see it like the Hubble

Aye. This nigga speaking his mind! Aye
This nigga shit ain't like mine!

Wait
Aw hell naw
Here go another young nigga making trouble (yea)
Young nigga making trouble (wait)
Young nigga making trouble

Young nigga making double that money
You Taxed on then trippled principle
I need patience cause I know that I'm gone get the Whole thang gotta get it in intervals
Got the bases loaded
I'm tryna make it a soul train line right at the home plate
Talk shit in the interview
Then I put back on my dolce scarf
Say too much and they'll finish you
I am not stupid
I ain't no goofy
Know what the truth is
Some shit just truthy
Too many movies
Nighas be thinking it's reall life
Til it's real life and they living it foolishly
This shit is merely a still life
Of a I'll life
Now we reading a eulogy

Aw hell naw

I can't go for the stain no
My nigga
I can't control the gang no
My niggas
All think different ain't the same see
I figured
If I wanna stay sharp minded gotta keep me some sharp niggas
And watch out for shark niggas
No weapon formed
Not even that stark nigga
I'm chasing the dark liquor
With clear water
It break it apart quicker
I'm breaking the blunt down
Put the gun down
Now smoking some raw niggas

// Is, This Cigarette //

Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
Lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine
Where my niggas at
Making something of themselves placing bigger bets
We got bigger fish to filet we ain't laying up
Don't give 'em that shit from the free throw, niggas fucking hacks?
Got the simulation glitching bitch we busting back
Now they leaning in to listen, got the baritone
Still a couple niggas drowsy off the [?] pack
I'm feeling energies I'm even peeping pheromones
I'm screening enemies like casting calls for Marvel flicks
Brought water to drink, brought water to gargle with
If it was salt water most at the surface like some snorkel shit
I'm in the dark water it's black and white just like the orcas is
Killing shit, Darth Vader even with the force
These niggas forcing it
Art paid us even with the failure, know I'm fortunate
Raw papers twisting up these joints, I'm no contortionist
Star gazer, look up at the sky and know it's more than this
Piss on niggas flows I'm Mr. Porcelain, please pardon me
Salt shakers for the seasoning it ain't no salt in me
Sharp razors in my company they not just ornaments
Far greater with my niggas, what's the coordinates

Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
It's a lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine

I was hotboxing the stain back at the gang way
I been chain smoking no chains just shorty namesake
I been lane switching I ain't switching the frame rate
Iron chef cooking you can't stay in the same kitchen
Whip it left handed my aim steady I can't sway
Bass clef branded they know that I keep it low key
Eight packs legend I can't stress it enough though
Nigga born from pain, I remember when I would hit purp up for that quarter thang
Got that bullshit off my shoulder like a halter top
[?] the type of nigga to cop Baltic ave
Been picking up the type of shit I ought to drop
On my Andre shit I might just go and grab a flute
'Cause flipping your shit for the mob is how they often flop
I gave 'em water and I heard someone talking flutes
A noble savage I can turn into Chernobyl if I drop this nuke

Honestly, I doubt it if I only seen it on the Internet
It's a lot of niggas bred, not a lot of niggas thorough
How this thing that I love gon' kill me, is this, cigarettes
Is it nicotine

// Reflection //

Put a mirror in a nigga face and he'll run
Tell em that you love him, he may pull out his gun
Look just like me even down to the walk
Noticed the difference probably soon as we talk

I do not politic with the fools
Counterfeit systems, I'm more than kind of bending the rules
Donavin Mitchell, I'm definitely finna talk all this jazz
Constantly victim, I'm more than kind of hip to the blues
That's why I can give a shit 'bout the news
Excel despite we consciously victim
These niggas like to strip us from truth
Large contradictions, I'm 6'5" tryna fit in the coupe
Large contributions to culture and somewhere someone sitting in cubes didn't approve
No ice cubes in my Riesling and you should know that
Wash the chicken before you season it, you should know that
That's a metaphor, my nigga please don't get caught off the Prozac out here nodding off
I'm out here getting to these visions I was plotting on
I windowshopped it then I copped it now I got it on
And I know everything that came before that dotted line these days
Held a mirror to my face (who you think you talking to huh?)
I didn't run away
I ran in place

Put a mirror in a nigga face and he'll run
Tell em that you love him, he gon' pull out his gun
Look just like me even down to the walk
Noticed the difference probably soon as we talk
We only talk about ball
We only talk once a year, not even that, I don't call
I haven't called in like three
He 6'2" I'm 6'5" he used to make me feel small
I used to think he was strong now I know he just weak
Got me climbing a mountain it's all cliffs and no peaks
I was slide, hydroplaning, it's all drifts and no grip
It's all good, don't trip
I used say that with tears
He only heard with his ears
We speak with more than our lips
My shoulders Pringle, no chips
I ain't gon' make it, nuff said
One day I didn't get upset
Some shit just is what it is
I put that shit on my kids though, I can not go out the same
That carpal tunnel my wrist, I'm way too deep with the script
It's paralyzing in fact
The analyzing the facts
Calculating the trauma to iterate it on wax
Fam, if it wasn't for rap
This shit a mirror of sorts, got me seeing myself
See niggas see they reflection and get to peeing themselves
Them untethered connections ain't really freeing at all
Cold shoulders I just pray I get to see them shits thaw
Bulldozing through the haze that's why it's coming so raw
And I ain't sorry at all

Put a mirror in a nigga face and he'll run
Tell em that you love him, he may pull out his gun
Look just like me even down to the walk
Noticed the difference probably soon as we talk

// Rug Burn //

Uh!
Niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow
Like their cousins stayed over the weekend
Real niggas know
Real bitches quote

Got no time to complain
I'm just tryna maintain
Ain't really tryna explain, why my streaming ain't main my nigga
Little did you know
But all my real niggas know
Yea my real niggas know
When they see me they live
They be like Mick you top five
I be like nigga, I know
I like to keep it a buck
I used to keep it like eighty
I hope you feeling my growth
Still niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow and don't smell the feet in their face
One by the head and the toe
Sweat for the bread with no yeast
I had the croissants and sweets
Seen niggas beg for the dough
Seen mamas knead the whole week
Seen butter melt on the biscuit as father's head for the door
I got the bread when he loaf
Had run ins with some prosciutto I gave em mirrors and smoke
And now I'm here with my toast
Finna bust at the sky and make shit they hear if they woke
I know the real ones a quote
I know my real niggas know

Niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow like can I just crash at your crib for a few, got nowhere to go

Real niggas know [20x]

I ain't gotta say shit
I ain't gotta make a list
I ain't even gotta trip when they skip acknowledgment
Kept a chip on a nigga shoulder and his pockets thick

Real niggas know [20x]
