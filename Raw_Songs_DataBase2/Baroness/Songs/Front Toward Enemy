So, I lied
It was a cold summer
By fall, true winter flows like a virgin spring

We're headed for disaster
But I won't close my eyes until it's over
So carry on
Some wars I gladly died in
But most fights only got me bloody
I carried on
And when every drop of blood I shed
Was spilled in vain
I carried on

We're headed for disaster
Disaster
Front toward enemy
We can only face
Front toward enemy

Front toward enemy
Enemy

There's a mile of rope that lays between my shoulders
It doesn't mean that I intend to hang
And I'm not afraid of dying
Like I know I should be

So, I lied
It was a cold summer
By fall, winter's truth will flow like a virgin spring
