The stars that shone between us
Were bluish-green and golden-like
Beware the hand that feeds us
Where the birds of prey
Hold onto the stolen light

Throw me an anchor
I hope you learned
When you gave me fire
I made it burn

The stars that shone between us
Were bluish-black and gold
The colours spreading everywhere
Begin to fade
Like bleach on poison-ivy skin

This is an emergency
This is an emergency

The stars that shone between us
Were all in monochrome

This is an emergency
The last one out will pay
This is an emergency
This is an...
Emergency

You'd throw me an anchor
And hope I'd learn
When you hold me to fire
You'd think I'd burn

When you bathe in fire
I'd throw you an anchor
I know you learned
When you hand me a lighter
I will make it burn
