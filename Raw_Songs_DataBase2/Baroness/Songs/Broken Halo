She is the deepest ocean
That I could hope to drown in
If my iron wings should break again
I hope I'd fly into your eyes

Cold and grey
Your eyes were cold and grey
I would do anything
To feel like I'm on fire again

I wouldn't hold my breath and stop the tide from rising
I'd open up my lungs

Let me hold your salt and sorrow in place
Like a wind that never breaks

I would tear my heart out
I'd walk a thousand crooked miles
Then I'd start a fire
Turn the world to flame
To watch it shining in your eyes

Cold and grey
Your eyes were cold and grey
I would do anything
To feel like I'm on fire again

I won't close my eyes to keep the sun from rising
I'll hold them open wide

Let me hold your broken halo inside
Like a sun that never shines

I hope your eyes
Are black on fire

Let me hold the salt and sorrow in place
Where the waves will never break
Let me hold your broken halo
Where the sunlight never shines
