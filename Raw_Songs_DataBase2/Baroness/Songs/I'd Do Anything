If you pulled gently I'd fall right back into line again
You help me check myself and all that I surround
It was moments ago
Knew exactly what to say
Spilling on the ground
The words forever gold and grey

When I make my escape
Will I get sucked up by the rain?

I am selfish, I am wrong
I'm scared to be alone
Every aching joint breaking at the bone

I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive
I would do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything, anything

The world keeps burning
So it's back into the fire again
You kept me low but I am
High above the ground
No, you didn't miss a word
You know exactly what I said
"I lost myself when I loved my enemy"

I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything to feel like I'm alive
I would do anything to feel like I'm alive again
I'd do anything, anything
