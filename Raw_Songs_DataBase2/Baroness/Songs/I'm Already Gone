Did I make a huge mistake
When I said your name?
Oh, I miss the sweet perfume
Of oil and gasoline
All the stars, all the suns
All the air I breathe
All the empty bottles that I leave

Before you know
I'll be on the open road
Now I'm black and green
Golden at the seams

I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone

All I made were big mistakes
Always went too far
All the stars, all the suns
All the air I breathe
All the empty promises I keep

Before you know
I'll be on the open road
Now I'm black and green
Golden at the seams

I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
Too late, so long
I'm already gone
And I'm already gone
