I see through this demise
The hallowed serpent unwise. 
He is learned in the ways of decay,
And he shone as winter's dawn fades. 
As brazen as the turn of the tide,
And certain as our season fades. 
So fill your cup to the hilt, 
Hew and sew our crops anew,
Rest and wake and comprehend faith.
So toil, that this haze unfolds, 
And pray that this harvest decays
