// Rays On Pinion //

Save your soul
It's bright with holes
Rays on pinion
Lay me down

Our trust lies in mighty wing
As we thrust ourselves into the drink
Pitched boats sail and ploughmen toil
To drift on and work the soil

Stow your gaze
Away these waves
Stain reflection
May we drown

This is our last goodbye
This is our final cry
This separation of bird and bone
Is an introduction to tide and lung

We've resigned ourselves to soar home
Despite these wayward rays

// The Birthing //

Holy rake
You piss and shake

Comely waif
Your knees abraid

Turn your back on the birthing
It's sweet again
Keep it tucked in your eyes
Wet and alive
Seaweed inside

Holy rake
Comely waif
Birthed blisters
Rake

// Isak //

Isak
Hands in the ground
Buried traces of sound scream

Hem in the seed
Water to salt
Salt into rain

Isak
Tender the swine
Carry the hare and the barrow home

// Wailing Wintry Wind //

See inside
Till you find me blindly
Slice the rind
Till you see me bleeding
Thousand blades
Of an unbeliever
Sift the sand
Hear the wail of winter winds

// Wanderlust //

Perambulation
Wading
Milk the keel through tidal slough at dawn
On and on
Grating and lapping at the swollen stinking skin
Imitation
Mating muscles cut through cord
Through mountain's own
On and on
Sated but engorged on mother's milk and fed as twins
Bold defecation
Raise the bow and aim for crimson dawn

// O'Appalachia //

Raise your voices
This is where the good times went from me
Breathe in choruses
This is where the waning sated me
Stand in valleys
This is where the rivers coursed my veins
Line the shoreline
This is where my blood will ebb away
