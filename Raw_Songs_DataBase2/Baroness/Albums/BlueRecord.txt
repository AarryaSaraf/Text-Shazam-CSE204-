// The Sweetest Curse //

Curse with me
Profane and discreet
Make her move
Cross veins and chamomile

Soft and sweet
Seasalt silver-meat
Buried deep
In crowskin overcoat

Save your breath
This may be the last
There is no novelty here on the earth

O'saviour!
Forever threadbare and faded
Drunken and arcane...
Curse the day

O'saviour!
There's rotgutted whiskey in ladies
For to ease the pain...
Or drown away

Save her!
You've crushed all the bones and the cradles
All along the way...
Along the way

// Jake Leg //

Jake leg!
Steal this wine away
Flay me
Underneath the brine

Running away
Through the sick and the pure
"Mind your feet!" lest they firmament tread

Crawl past the soft
Spiraled sinewy teeth
"Soiled dove!" steal the fruit of it's jaws

Lady!
Keep those hounds at bay
Feed me
The fruits of Avalon

The body's a vessel
The hands find a cure
"Flesh is weak!" and my lip needs a meal

Weak in the knees
And you're wet on the floor
"Ace of staves!" we will dance evercome

// Steel That Sleeps The Eye //

Steel that sleeps with the morningstar
Would that I could sin once more

Blades will sing over stone and field
That their song might grace our fall

Pallid limbs in the raven's thrall
Fracture sulphur honey skin

Waves are screaming abraxan hymns
So that shoreline virgins cry

Reel in place
'til the bastards take me away
Sober taste of the eyes

// Swollen And Halo //

The steel that sleeps the eye
Needs nor tax nor toll
The kings with men might lie
Swollen and halo'd

Her sweetest skin burns

Now I've buried all the gold beneath my hide
Now I'll swallow breath with blood

Of pole and anchor
Of stone and mitre
Of god and beast and
Wine and fish and man

The virgin ground stains

Now we've wandered through the polestar's dusty floe
And my crown is breath and blood

// A Horse Called Golgotha //

Call the boy
He's down the hallow
Cull the tide
Distill the rye

Now it's time for medication
Stallions on the eiderdown

The stained horizon
Ablaze with revolvers
Stampedes and bridles

Exorcise the family demons
Stallions on the eilderdown

The stained horizon
Of the dark rein and rider
The steed named Golgotha

// O'er Hell And Hide //

I took my black teeth down to the sea
Brother of mine
I washed myself in your steely gaze

We read your name o'er jaguar hide
Brother of mine
You saw terminus and bruised your knees

I lashed their bodies to the wheeling suns
Brother of mine
You tossed wet bluebirds in the air

I sensed the whetstone's dark embrace
Brother of mine
Tender and rude like tiger skinned

We once were lechers, rakes and rogues
Mother of mine
You're coming through

We swam with sages, trout and thorns
Father of mine
You're coming through

We swallowed truncheon, shield and child
Sister of mine
You're coming through

We spoke with sinners, snakes, and slaves
Daughter of mine
You're coming through

// War, Wisdom And Rhyme //

Only an angel can feed
On ashes and ovaries
Blame the pegans and saints

They are one

War, wisdom and rhyme
The peach and the rattlesnake

We are grave
We are graves
We will die

Maybe the sawgrass did feel
Burnt confederate steel
Spoil't milk on the grave

We were wrong

War, wisdom and rhyme
The catfish and bayonet

We are grave
We are graves
We will die

Grave fire
War, wisdom and rhyme

We will...

// The Gnashing //

All of your fears are well founded and true
All my hands are callous and cruel
All of my arrows that riddle you through
Are bullets that fire me back into you
All of the rivers are boiling with thirst
All my hands are covered with earth
All of my children that gnash with their teeth
Are paperback novels and dogs scratching fleas
