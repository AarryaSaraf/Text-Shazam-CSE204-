Album: OutOfTime

// Radio Song //

Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio
Yo! turn to that station

The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

When I got to the house
And I called you out
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song on the radio
It makes me sad

I meant to turn it off
To say goodbye
To leave in quiet, that radio song
Hey, hey, hey (ha ha)

I've everything to show (everything to show)
I've everything to hide (everything to hide)
Look into my eyes
Listen

When I got to the show
Yo ho ho
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song, and the DJ sucks
It makes me sad

I tried to turn it off (turn it off)
To say goodbye my love
That radio song
Hey, hey, hey

The world is collapsing
Around our ears
I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it

Yeah, baby, baby, baby

I tried to sing along
But damn that radio song
Hey hey hey

I've everything to show (everything to show)
I've everything to hide (everything to hide)
Look into my eyes
Listen to the radio

I turned up the radio
But I can't hear it
No, I can't hear it

Hey, hey, hey
Say what?
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Say what?
Hey, hey, hey

Check it out
What are you saying?
What are you playing?
Who are you obeying?
Day out, day in, huh?
Baby, baby, baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their life- radio listeners

// Losing My Religion //

Oh life, it's bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up

Consider this
Consider this, the hint of the century
Consider this, the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come
Flailing around
Now I've said too much

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream, dream

// Low //

Dusk is dawn is day
Where did it go?
I've been laughing
Fast and slow

Moving in a still frame
Howling at the moon
Morning found me laughing
Up and down, down

Low, low, low
Night suits me fine
And morning suits me fine
I've been so happy, happy
Way up high, high

In between
Down below
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I said the morning
It isn't your time
Barefoot naked
I can see your lines

It doesn't bother me
If you are right
Your grass is grassy wet
Your light white is bright
Light white, light

I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

You and me
We know about time
We know how things go
They come and go
They live and grow
They pass and go
And glow and glow
Up and down
High and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I skipped the part about love
It seems so silly and low
I skipped the part about love
It seems so shallow and low
Low, low, low
Low, low, low

I like your hands
All full of glory
All full of glory

// Near Wild Heaven //

Whenever we hold each other
We hold each other
There's a feeling that's gone
Something has gone wrong

And I don't know how much longer I can take it
House made of heart, break it
Take my head in your hands and shake it
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

Whatever it takes I'm giving
It's just a gift I'm given
Try to live inside
Trying to move inside

And I always thought that it would make me smarter
But it's only made me harder
My heart thrown open wide
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

(Inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

I'm holding my hands together
Holding my feet together
Holding myself together
In this near wild heaven
Not near enough

Near wild heaven
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

(Living inside, living inside, living inside)
Near wild heaven

// Shiny Happy People //

Shiny happy people laughing

Meet me in the crowd, people, people
Throw your love around, love me, love me
Take it into town, happy, happy
Put it in the ground where the flowers grow 
Gold and silver shine

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing 

Everyone around, love them, love them
Put it in your hands, take it, take it
There's no time to cry, happy, happy
Put it in your heart where tomorrow shines
Gold and silver shine

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing 

Whoa, here we go

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing

Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people holding hands
Shiny happy people laughing

Shiny happy people holding hands
People, happy people
People

// Belong //

Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She got up from the kitchen table
Folded the newspaper and silenced the radio
Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea, sea

Those creatures jumped the barricades
And have headed for the sea
She began to breathe
To breathe at the thought of such freedom
Stood and whispered to her child, belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; belong

Stood and whispered to her child, belong
She held the child and whispered
With calm, calm; belong

These barricades can only hold for so long
Her world collapsed early Sunday morning
She took the child held tight
Opened the window
A breath, this song, how long
And knew, knew; belong

// Half A World Away //

This could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away here
And I had sworn to go it alone, hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Go it alone 'n hold it along
Hold

Oh, this lonely deeps and holy way
Half a world, half a world away
My shoes are gone, my life spent
I've had too much to drink
I didn't think, I didn't think of you
I guess that's all I needed
To go it alone and hold it along
And haul it along and hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this lonely world is wasted
Pathetic eyes, high-alive
Blind eye that turns to see
The storm it came up strong
It shook the trees and blew away our fear
I couldn't leave it here
To go it alone, hold it along
Haul it along and hold it
Go it alone hold it along
Hold

Go it alone and hold it along
Haul it along 'n hold it
Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall
Hold

Oh, this could be the saddest dusk I've ever seen
Turn to a miracle, high-alive
My mind is racing, as it always will
My hands tired, my heart aches
I'm half a world away to go

// Texarkana //

20,000 miles to an oasis
20,000 years will I burn
20,000 chances I've wasted
Waiting for the moment to turn

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Walking through the woods, I have faced it
Looking for something to learn
30,000 thoughts have been wasted
Never in my time to return

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

All my life
Waiting to find

40,000 stars in the evening
Look at them fall from the sky
40,000 reasons for living
40,000 tears in your eyes

I would give my life to find it
I would give it all
Catch me if I fall

Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall
Catch me if I fall, catch me if I fall

// Country Feedback //

This flower is scorched, this film is on
On a maddening loop, these clothes
These clothes don't fit us right
I'm to blame
It's all the same
It's all the same

You come to me with a bone in your hand
You come to me with your hair curled tight
You come to me with positions

You come to me with excuses
Ducked out in a row
You wear me out
You wear me out

We've been through fake-a-breakdown
Self-hurt, plastics, collections
Self-help, self-pain
EST, psychics, fuck all

I was central, I had control
I lost my head
I need this, I need this

A paperweight, junk garage
Wedding ring, a honey pot
Crazy, all the lovers have been tagged

A hotline, a wanted ad
It's crazy what you could've had

It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need it, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

It's crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had
I need this, I need this

Crazy what you could've had
Crazy what you could've had

// Me In Honey //

I sat there looking ugly, looking ugly and mean
I knew what you were saying, you were saying to me
Baby's got some new rules
Baby said she's had it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time on me
It seems a lot to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Knocked silly, knocked flat, sideways down
These things they pick you up and they turn you around
Say your piece
Say you're sweet for me

It's all the same to share the pain with me
It's all the same, save the shame for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

Baby's got some new rules
Baby says she's had it with me
There's a fly in the honey
And baby's got a baby with me
That's a part, that's a part of me

Left me to love
What it's doing to me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

What about me?
What about me?
