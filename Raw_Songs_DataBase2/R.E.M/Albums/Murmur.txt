// Radio Free Europe //

Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason: it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't Country at all

Radio station: decide yourself

Keep me out of Country and the word
Wheel of fortune's leading us: absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the floor
That this isn't nothing at all

Straight off the boat, where to go

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide: defy the media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't fortunate at all

Radio station: decide yourself

We're calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide yourself: come in on a boat 
Media's too fast
Keep me out of Country and the word
Disappointment into us: absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe

// Pilgrimage //

Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune

They called the clip, a two-headed cow
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck, a two-headed cow

The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune

Speaking in tongues, it's worth a broken lip
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured this will not last
Take a turn for the worse
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck, a two-headed cow

The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune
Pilgrimage, pilgrimage

Speaking in tongues, it's worth a broken lip
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck
Rest assured this will not last
Take a turn for the worse
Keep your hate, clipped and distant
Keep your luck, two-headed

The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune
Pilgrimage, pilgrimage

The pilgrimage has gained momentum
Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune
Take a turn, take a turn
Take a fortune, take a fortune

// Laughing //

Laocoön and her two sons
Pressured storm, tried to move
No other more emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Run the gamut, sated view
Know them more, emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing

In a room, lock the door, latch the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Ran the gamut, settled new
Find a place fit to laugh
Lock the doors and latch the room

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune

Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune

// Talk About The Passion //

Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

Empty prayer, empty mouths, combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths, talk about the passion
Combien, combien, combien de temps

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Combien, combien, combien de temps

Talk about the passion, talk about the passion
Talk about the passion, talk about the passion
Talk about the passion, talk about the passion

// Moral Kiosk //

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock, but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head

It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
She was laughing like a Horae
Put that knee into our landslide
Take the steps to dash a roving eye

It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head

It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight
Inside, cold, dark, fire, twilight

// Perfect Circle //

Put your hair back, we get to leave
Eleven gallows on your sleeve
Shallow figure, winner's paid
Eleven shadows way out of place

Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room

Pull your dress on and stay real close
Who might leave you where I left off
A perfect circle of acquaintances and friends
Drink another, coin a phrase

Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room
Heaven assumed, shoulders high in the room

Try to win and suit your needs
Speak out sometimes but try to win

Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room
Standing too soon, shoulders high in the room

// Catapult //

We were little boys, we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, ope your mouth

Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Catapult (catapult), catapult
Catapult (catapult), catapult

We were little boys, we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, ope your mouth
We in step, in hand, your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope, a question

Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Catapult (catapult), catapult
Catapult (catapult), catapult

March could be darker, March could be darker
Catapult (catapult), catapult
Catapult (catapult), catapult

We were little boys, we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, open your mouth
We in step, in hand, your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope, a question

Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Did we miss anything, did we miss anything
Catapult (catapult), catapult
Catapult (catapult), catapult

// Sitting Still //

This name I got we all agreed
She could stop, stop it well rid
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still

I'm the sun and you can read
I'm the sign and you're not deaf
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

This name I got we all agree
She could stop, stop it well rid
We could bind it in the sist-
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

You can gather when I talk, talk until you're blue
You could get away from me, get away from me

I'm up to par and Katie bars the kitchen signs but not me in
Set a trap for love, big kill
Don't waste your time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
Can you hear me

// 9-9 //

(Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reinforced.
Now what does that mean? Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord to hesitate.)

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongue, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards
Down her back

Give me a couple, don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongue, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards
Down her back

Give me a couple, don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation
What is in my mind, what is in my mind

(Steady repetition is a compulsion mutually reinforced.
Now what does that mean? Is there a just contradiction?
Nothing much. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake, oh, come on, hesitate, hesitate.)

Got to punch, right on target
Twisting tongues, got a stripe
Down your back, all nine yards
Down her back

Give me a couple, don't give me a couple of pointers
Turn to lies and conversation fear, conversation fear
Conversation fear, conversation fear

// Shaking Through //

Could it be that one small voice doesn't count in the room
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way
Could this by three be ten, honor marches on
Yellow like a geisha gown, denial all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

Are we grown way too far, taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune
In my life

Ears that are still, children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha gown, denying all the way

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

Shaking through, opportune
Shaking through, opportune

// We Walk //

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the wood, we walk
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the woods, we walk
Take oasis, take oasis
Take oasis, take oasis

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the world, we walk
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Oh, oh, oh
Into the, oh, oh, into the, oh, oh
Up, up, up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

// West Of The Fields //

Long gone intuition
To assume are gone when we try
I dream of a living jungle
I'm on my way back home, couldn't find shyer

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fields

Dreams of Elysian
To assume are gone when we try
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try I listen with my eyes, oversimplify

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone

The antelopes are strange
Trying to sicken me
The antelopes are strange
Trying to sicken me

Dreams of Elysian
You assume are gone when we die
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try to listen to your eyes, when we die

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fields

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of fields
