// A Month Of Saturdays //

Five o'clock Friday
All my work is done
I can hardly wait
Let's take the server
Let's sling it around
Let's make it taste so sweet

I wanna take all the Saturdays
I wanna stay up late
I wanna stomp my feet on the ground
I wanna celebrate

A month of Saturdays, Saturdays
A month of Saturday, Saturdays, ah

I'm tired of waiting for the weekend to begin (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday)
I'm tired of punching in (Wednesday, Thursday)
Give me a holiday that never ends (Friday, Saturday)
Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend
Give me a weekend, weekend

A month of Saturdays, Saturdays
I'm talkin' Saturday, Saturdays, ah

Shout

Give me a weekend, weekend, weekend

// Animal //

Hey what's the big deal? 
Tell me how to feel? 
I know where we boomeranged and fell from grace. 
Point me to the stars I'm up for the chase. 
I know where we fell on our face. 
Jump with me. 
You jump with me. 

Hey, what's the big deal- 
I'm an animal. 
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(It's calling me to work it out.) [x2]

(Whoa) 

I don't wanna boomerang. 
I don't wanna cannonball. 
I'm not angling. 
I don't want to fall. 
Tell me I'm the anchor of my own ascension. 
Tell me I'm a tourist in the 4th dimension? 

Hey, what's the big deal- 
I'm an animal. 
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(It's calling me to work it out.) 

(Whoa) 

work it out. 

I am vibrating at the speed of light. 
Take my hand, we'll wind up the night. 
Spin me, win me, lift me, kiss me. 
Trip me, trust me, cuss me, judge me. 
touch me now. 
you take my hand. 
you trust me now 
you understand. 

Hey, what's the big deal- 
I'm an animal. 
(The answer landed on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(The future and the truth, on my rooftop. Whoa.) 
I'm an animal. 
(It's calling me to work it out.)

(Whoa) 

I am vibrating at the speed of light.

// Bad Day //

A Public service announcement followed me home the other day 

I paid it nevermind. Go away. 

Shits so thick you could stir it with a stick- free Teflon whitewashed presidency 

We're sick of being jerked around 

Wear that on your sleeve 


Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 

Count your blessings. 

We're sick of being jerked around 

We all fall down. 


Have you ever seen the televised St. vitus subcommittee prize 

Investigation dance? Those-ants-in- pants glances. 

Well, look behind the eyes 

It's a hallowed, hollow anesthesized 

"save my own ass, screw these guys" 

smoke and mirror lock down 


Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 

Count your blessings. 

the papers wouldn't lie! 

I sigh. Not one more 


Its been a bad day. 

Please dont take a picture 

Its been a bad day. 

Please 


We're dug in the deep the price is steep. 

The auctioneer is such a creep. 

The lights went out, the oil ran dry 

We blamed it on the other guy 

Sure, all men are created equal. 

Heres the church, heres the steeple 

Please stay tuned--we cut to sequel 

ashes, ashes, we all fall down. 


Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, Count your blessings. 

Ebrace the lowest fear/Ignore the lower fears 

Ugh, this means war. 


Its been a bad day. 

Br. 


Broadcast me a joyful noise unto the times, lord, 

Count your blessings. 

We're sick of being jerked around 

We all fall down. 


Its been a bad day... 

Pleaase...

// Fretless //

He's got his work and she comes easy
They each come around when the other is gone
Me, I think I got stuck somewhere in between
I wouldn't confide in the Prodigal Son
The die has been cast, the battle is won
The bullets were blanks, a double aught gun
I couldn't admit to a minute of fun

They come and they come and they come and they come
I accepted with a gentle tongue
No words spoken, no need to speak

Take it, stomp twice, ring the bell
Tether that ring and phrase
Enough with the rifle and talk already
We all know what it means
Take this conversation to your great divide
I can only swallow what I ate
And I don't hate him
And I don't hate her

They come and they come and they come and they come
I accepted with a gentle tongue
No heart broken, no need to speak

(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone
(Don't talk to me)
Don't talk to me about being alone

Reach for each other before you leave
Reach peace with a E-A-see
Don't threaten me with a gentle tease
Don't threaten me with angry
Please, please, please
Don't try to tell me what I am

(Talk to me)
Don't talk to me
(Talk to me)
Don't talk to me
