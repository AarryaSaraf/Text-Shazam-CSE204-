Now my suspicion's on the rise
I have known, I have known your kind.
Please don't talk, don't make me think
Order up another drink
Let me let imagination drive.

Can't you see
I need
Nothing too deep.

Imagination
Come alive
Suspicion
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.

Listen to the devils in my ear.
Tell me what, what I want to hear
You're so funny, you're so fine
You're so perfect, you're so mine.
That I never had an opportunity
To hide
No, I've never had a chance

Can't you see
I need
Nothing too deep.

Imagination come alive
Suspicion
Tonight, I'll dream tonight.

Look into my eyes.
They hypnotize.
The lights, the drinks.
Let the music carry you away

My eyes are blurred
My sights are limited
Am I sensing a familiar twinge?

Please don't speak
Make me think
It's all too deep

Imagination
Come alive
Suspicion
Step down, I'll dream tonight

Step down, I'll dream
You're so naked baby
Carry me away
Dream, dream.
