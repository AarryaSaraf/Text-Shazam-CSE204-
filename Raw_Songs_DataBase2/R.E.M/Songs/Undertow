I know what I wanted.
I know what I wanted.
I know how I wanted this to be.
You go down to the water.
Drink down of the water.
Walk up off the water, leave it be.

This is not my dream sister.
It is cold in heaven and I'm not sprouting wings.
I'm drowning...me.
I'm drowning...me, yeah.

Brother can you see those birds?
They don't look to heaven.
They don't need religion they can see.
They go down to the water,
Drink down on the water,
Fly up off the water, leave it be.

This is not my time sister, 
It is cold in heaven
And no one's coming after me.
I'm drowning (breathing ourselves) me (breathing ourselves).
I'm drowning (breathing ourselves) me (breathing ourselves) yeah.

You know I am tired.
Cold and bony tired.
Nothing's gonna save me, I can see.
I can't say I'm fearful, I can't say I'm not afraid.
But I am not resisting, I can see.
I don't need a heaven, I don't need religion.
I am in the place where I should be.

I am breathing water, I am breathing water.
You know a body's got to breathe.
I'm drowning (breathing ourselves) me (breathing ourselves).
I'm drowning (breathing ourselves) me (breathing ourselves).
I'm drowning (breathing ourselves) me (breathing ourselves).
