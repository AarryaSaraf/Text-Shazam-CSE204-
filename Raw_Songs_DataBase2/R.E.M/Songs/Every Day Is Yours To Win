With the walk (walk)
and the talk (talk)
and the tic-tac clock (clock)

With the rock (rock)
and the roll (roll)
and the bridge (bridge)
and the told (told)

With the brilliance (brilliance)
and the light (light)
with the sting (sting)
and the hide (hide)
and the road ahead of you.

I cannot tell a lie
It's not all cherry pie
But it's all there waiting for you
Yeah you

Hey Yeah
Hey Yeah
Hey Yeah
I know

With the walk (walk)
And the woods (woods)
And the southern fudge (fudge)
There's an old look bitter and blue

While I'm nothing but confused (confused)
with nothing left to lose (lose)
and if you buy that
I've got a bridge for you

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
I know

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
I know

Oh...

Every day is new again
Every day is yours to win
And that's how heroes are made

I wanted (I wanted) to win (to win)
so I'd said it again:
That's how heroes are made

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah
I know

Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah (Hey Yeah)
Hey Yeah
I know

Ah...
