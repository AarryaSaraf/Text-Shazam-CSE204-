Hey baby
This is not a challenge
It just means that I don't love you as much as I always said I did

I was wrong
I have been laughable wrong
Sandpaper, paper mache, chalk, and hung out web

Of the city and your skin now..
I didn't have to be afraid
I didn't have to feel so stupid
I can see myself! I can feel

That's just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Discoverer! 
Laughing! 
Discoverer!

Floating across Houston
This is where I am.
I see the city rise up tall.
The opportunities and possibilities.
Well, I have never felt so called.

Remember the vodka espresso night of discovery,
Remember that?
Laughing! Discovery!
Oh how I look back and reflect
How I felt it, how it set.
I don't have to feel so wrong
Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Just the slightest bit of finesse
Might have made a little less mess
But it was what it was,
Let's all get on with it, now!

Discoverer! 
Discoverer! 
Discoverer! 
Discoverer! 
Discoverer!
