// (At Your Best) You Are Love //

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me

Let me know
Let me know

When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began

But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know

Let me know

Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

'Cause when you're you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Let me know, know

Stay at your best, baby
Stay at your best, baby
Stay at your best, baby

// Alabama //

Yup, duplex in New Orleans east
I was writing down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleeping on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stinging me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt in law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wife-beater
Bare feet and bra-less, titties swinging
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok classics
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Maxes
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feeling unnatural
This what I would do just to show you
That it's special now

What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?

// Mine //

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

// U-N-I-T-Y //

U-N-I-T
U-N-I

My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six under oath, don't want no hocus pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my facemask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman, Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew
Like niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowin' down? Are you holdin' down?
Whoever held you down
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you
Swished the buckets with ya, who was fuckin' with ya?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now is it forced black?
Hail Mary on the fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah

Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy, North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy and 'Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky

U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche Bugatti-design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl

You deserve to have the best in life"

// Commes Des Garcons //

He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs
When he's lit he show 'em
Kept it faded on the sides
We were seeing someone
We was dating on the side
He was seeing double
I was spinning hula
We were spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feelin' like a power tool
Finna move a nigga out his momma house now
That's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Would that diamond shine for real?
Shine for real

Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go

Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons
Comme des Garçons, Comme des Garçons, Comme des

// Ambience 002: "Honeybaby" //

Oh yes, oh slide

Xenons with the blue color
If that's a lease 'least it'll look cool on ya
That your business and I'm off when I'm on ya
Like holidays, I get off on ya

// Wither //

Over where the trees burn down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes

And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
And tonight I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (when I was young)
See me (too) wither
(When I was young)

Know that (me) I've enjoyed the sunshine
When I was young, know it happens all—(me)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine—(me)
Know it happens all (me)—all the time (me)
Know it happens all (me)—all the time (me)
When I was young (me, me)

// Hublots //

Turn the mountain view, find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
Run

I know you're in there somewhere
Can't wait for someone, something you need
Someone out there
Try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with

Late at night sometimes it helps
You don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment life can end
This'll all be over with

I know you're in there somewhere
Can't outrun love,it's something you need
It's been so long

Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight? Platinum

// Sideways //

Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo!

I was in all them hours in it
10K, toking mid strokes
Prime prime time of my life with you
Putting prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights with you
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a minute
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the biggest out next week
On me on, my partners

When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sitting sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late

// Deathwish (ASR) //

[Part I: Impietas]

Are you against me or are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?

[Part II: Deathwish]

Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless?
Leave myself at the mercy of you
At the mercy of you
And I be needing my sleep in peace
Need to trust you
At the mercy of you

You
At the, at the, at the
At the, yeah, at the
At the, at the the

// Rushes //

Gonna be somebody, oh I follow
Oh and it's so cloudy
Running showers and the mist so fly
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
Oh I see the lines, there's two lines (walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, to be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (It's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet)
Infatuation's your rush
(Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah
Do you wish you were me?)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop (Do you wish you were me?)
All what happens to be, now it happens to me, upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel
(What happens to me)
Bet you wish you was me
(You, just you and me)
(I need some help on my feet)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I be up to my feet
I wake up feeling weak
Wake me up in a week
(It's like drivin' round) (Stroke me, suck me, pipe me down)
(Two is a crowd, quieting down)
(Bite me down, pad me down, do whatever to fly me down)
It don't matter, pipe it down
Two is a crowd, quieting down

What stays and what what's gone and what's here still
And what's here still
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, rid
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel

// Higgs //

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs

What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video; only difference is, it's flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours

Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love

// Mitsubishi Sony //

That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone
Niggas sound like Reggie
(Already, ran through already
Nigga going in, fuck it)

Pray to the pipe (fuck it) I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big body Merc, LED lights and it's all overprice
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah they're watching my fence, like they're next to my kin
Like they're paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my my
Get it, get it
