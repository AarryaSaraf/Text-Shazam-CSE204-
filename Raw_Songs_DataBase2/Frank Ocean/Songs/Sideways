Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo!

I was in all them hours in it
10K, toking mid strokes
Prime prime time of my life with you
Putting prime numbers up though
On them 777 flights with you
Take a shower with it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a minute
Outta wedlock, God forgive it
Then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at the Garden
Let the LED roll, deer hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the biggest out next week
On me on, my partners

When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up they gon' hate
When I'm down they gon' celebrate
Sitting sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late
