One, two

Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (Maker)
My heart (You heart) breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going that way (The same)

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasing after all the same
Chasing after our ends

Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossing in style someday
My dream maker, heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going the same

Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasing after our ends
Chasing after our ends

Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me
