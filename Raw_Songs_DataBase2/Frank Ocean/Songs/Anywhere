Oh, girl you blow my mind every time that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing 'cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait 'til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bed, little shorty ain't scared

We just do it anywhere; we just do it anywhere,
We just do it anywhere; we just do it anywhere
In the back seat of my car, oh no, she don't mind!
We'll be all up in your office, put in that over time!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
