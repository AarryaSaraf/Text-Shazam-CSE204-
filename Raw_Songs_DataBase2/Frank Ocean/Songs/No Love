OK, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinning down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen and pad; gotta work out
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard

You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

OK, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie
You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
You're my only, baby you're my only
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl
I know it's hard

You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no

I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
I can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
To get back up to you
Never had a clue

I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love
I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love
I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain

No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
