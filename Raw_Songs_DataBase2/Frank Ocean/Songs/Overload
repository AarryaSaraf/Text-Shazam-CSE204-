Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know I'm not weak, these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind, oh, I
I got cargo with me
All these memories feel
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now

I been moving buses, further and further
I just can't do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload

Drag my life along by the end of a rope
Trying to make by, I'm trying
On the other side, someone's tugging hard
They only getting stronger, oh, I
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me out, help me out

I been moving buses, further and further
I just can do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

I been trying to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands
Can't hold up the world
It's coming down, it's coming

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me

Overload, overload, overload
Overload, overload, overload
