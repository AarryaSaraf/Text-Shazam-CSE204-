// When You Came //

When you came
Warm and tender and bittersweet
And surrendered to the love I had to give
I started to live, ooh, yeah, pretty baby

When you came, baby
Satisfaction was a dream fulfilled
Our reaction was so positive and I've
Never felt so alive

I never lived until you came
Ooh, baby
My life has never been the same

I blew my mind
Like a rocket at the end of countdown
Made my heart beat like a thousand drums
To each others and then some
All that happened to me

Yeah, when you came
For a moment, we were all there was
Nothing else existed, not the earth or the sky
Just you and I

I never lived until you came
Oh, baby, no
My life has never been the same
Ooh, baby, yeah

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came

My, my, my, my, my
My life has never been the same
I, I, I, I, I
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came

Ooh, I never lived until you came
Ooh, baby, no
My life has never been the same
Ooh, baby, yeah
I never lived until you came

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
My life has never been the same

I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came
I never lived 'til you came

// Get Out Of Town //

Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move, baby
If you're gonna be in this vicinity
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Lover, you got just about an hour
Before I get home and take a shower
Watchin' the clock tick-tock and steady
For makin' love, I'm makin' ready
With you I'm plannin' some delight tonight
You got it comin' and, oh

I maybe here to get it now
Oh, please, say you'll stay
It's gonna be a guess so you can bet it now
But if you think, 'no', then go

Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move, baby
If you're gonna be in this vicinity
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Hey, lover, lover, I feel sensuous and tingly
Thinkin' how you look lookin' at me
Not worth a 'maybe' or an 'I might'
Your eyes are givin' me the 'go' light
And I better mind, that look is genuine
Looks like you want me 'cause

Hey, your smile is so inviting now
I don't have no way
Think makin' love with you would be exciting now
But if you think I'm wrong, so long

Get out of town, go catch your plane
Hop on a bus or take a train, baby
Get out of town, if you remain, baby
I'm tellin' you before the evening is through
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Ooh, lover, you can be talkin' 'bout the weather
And really be sayin', let's get together
It's not what you say but how you say it
And I want it too so I'll obey it
That certain sound that keeps me hangin' around
Is drawin' me to you, hon

Yeah, I'm comin' at you now
Oh, I'm on my way
You'll always be mine if I can get you more
So take me on or be gone

Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move
If you're gonna be in this locality
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

So good
So good
So good
So good

Get out of town
(Get out of town)
Get out of town
(Get out of town)

// Do Like I Do //

You got to do like I do, oh, like I do
When we're far apart and your lonesome heart
Makes your eyes wander to somebody new
You might want them so much, you can look but, oh, don't touch

You got to do like I do, recognize desire as a physical need
That you can rise above, oh, like I do
Don't love the one you're with? Search 'til you get with the one you love
Oh, like I do, you got to do like I do

When you're out with your friends and the coupling off begins
And the heavy rappers start to hit on you
If the question is romance, let the answer be, "No chance"
Do like I do, let it in one ear, right past your smile out of the other

Oh, like I do, don't let another lost soul
Talk you into going undercover, do like I do

I know gossip would take a love so good
And spread the proof of one of us is playing, they been saying
Oh, don't give me that he said, that she said that they said, that we said
On it goes

How the stories starts and stops, nobody knows
But I got my baby
Check them so they know that they can go 'til it freezes over
Oh, like I do

Even if they try 'til the fourth of July
Comes in our door, yeah
They never gonna break us up
If you do like I do

Like I do, oh
Like I do, oh
You got to do like I do
Do like I do

// Open //

Open
My love for you is open
My love for you is open to
Whatever you wanna do
My hearts door is open
No more positive feeling

All the signs of passion
And warm desire
Their welcome hand is out for you
To come on inside

Open
You don't have to knock to come in
And let love begin

My golden arms are open
To embrace your body
With all the holdin' two arms can give
Pull all this with me

Want you to know that
Just tellin' you
That is the key
Too much been locked up inside of me
Open

Open
My mind is always open
Suggestions that you're ready to make
I'm ready to take

Open
My love for you is open
And all the stops, when I become yours
If you make it so

There ain't no stoppin' you
Love is the key
Return as my lover
It's all I ever will be

You gotta be open
Well, everything is open
Everything that I wanna do
Is depending on you

Open...

// So In Love //

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

We make music without playin' a note
In a private place, together we'll be
Listenin' to a tune somebody wrote
That fits our situation to a T

Yeah, a voice on the stereo singin' softly
Describin' what I feel about you
The singer just seems to know all about it
Seems like the writer must
Have sat down and wrote this song about us

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

Yeah, my kingdom exists wherever you go
I sit down beside you and I'm on my throne
You're my queen and I just want you to know
Your love has been another zone

So into you and I'm with every bit of me
And it's where I want to stay for good
Got a lifetime supply of me to give to you
Let no one tell you this is not it
'Cause when it comes to true love, you know we got it

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

In the room, we're just two silhouettes
The only light is from the fireplace
Ooh, we're close as any two people can get
And a look of love is shimmering on your face

Passionate kiss of fire that you get with me
Arouses me to want to make love
Stimulates my entire sensitivity
Oh, it's so good when we touch
All the time will never be too much
Never, ever be too much

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

(So in love, in love, in love)
And you and me will always
(So in love, in love, in love)
So in love, baby
Do say you'll always stay
(So in love, in love, in love)

So in love, baby, yeah
So in love, baby, yeah
(So in love, in love, in love)
So in love, baby, yeah

// Like Nobody Can //

Moment to moment, you fill my hour
Like nobody can, oh, baby
You can make me feel love's power
Like nobody can, oh, baby

Two people love and don't know why
Just because they are wherever they may be
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
And I love you because you're you
Oh, darlin', and because I'm me

Oh, lean on me 'cause it's only those we love
Who comfort leanin' like nobody can
Life is only life but for me
You give it meaning like nobody can

I mean these things, I mean every word
No sense wastin' breath just sayin' words that may sound good
If there's no substance there, ooh
So I express myself by sayin' what you make me feel
It's comes from deep inside somewhere, oh

It's heavy to discover that your lover can make you sad
Really sad like nobody can
We'll go back and lay down beside you and proceed to
Make you happy and you're happy that somebody can
Somebody can

You do it for me, baby
And you do it for me, baby, ah, yeah, yeah
(Like nobody can)
You take my heart and soul, mind and body
And make me feel good, oh, you make me feel good
(Like nobody can)

// Castles Made Of Sand //

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand
Oh, no

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Blown apart
By strong ocean breeze
Scattered, scattered
In a million tiny pieces
Unstable, unable

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Washed away
When the tide starts to change
And nothing left, nothing, no, nothing
Not a trace of where it stood
Weak foundations, mere imitation

Well, if our love is made of sand
Then let it be a desert land
A desert land
Let it be strong and free
And wide and warm
Like a desert land

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

(Castles made of sand)
No, no, don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Castles made of sand
(Don't let our love be made of sand)
Castles made of sand
(Not yours and mine)
Castles made of sand

Let it be strong and wide
Free and warm
Like a desert land
(Castles made of sand)
Don't let our love be made of sand

Oh, baby, don't let our love be made of sand
(Castles made of sand)
Let it be strong and wide
Warm and free
