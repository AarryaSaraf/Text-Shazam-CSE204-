Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough, now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be

You're so good, you're so fine
You're like my beauty queen
My mama and baby combined
I love your ways
You're got personality and charisma for days

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be

You plant a seed
And now the more I have of you
The more that I need
Can't help how I care
I don't want to be greedy
But I don't wanna share

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Blow it, blow it, blow it...

You rang my bell
Ding dong, now I've got a story to tell
So loud and clear
I've got to do my best to keep you here

Go on and strut your stuff, baby
I can't get enough, baby
Mister Catch has met his match

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I, I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be, oh...

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be
Well, well, well, well

Baby love, I can't get enough now
Don't you know you're making it tough now
For anybody else and me
I get the feeling deep down inside me
If your love was ever denied me
Alone is what I would be
