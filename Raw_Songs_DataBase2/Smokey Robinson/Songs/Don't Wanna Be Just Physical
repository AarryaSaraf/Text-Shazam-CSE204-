The moment that I saw you, baby, I knew
That we could be lovers
There are other guys that want you, I know it's true
And you're only human
If I kiss you, kiss you all night
If I hold you, squeeze you real tight
Tell me, baby, tell me would it be right
If I can't be your only one

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me
I don't wanna get physical
Don't wanna be just ph-physical
I don't wanna get physical, baby
Don't wanna be that typical

Sexual attraction when that's all it's for
Can leave you so empty
Mental satisfaction can mean so much more
I wanna love you completely
Can you tell me that you really care
Or do you want me for a one night affair
Tell me, baby, 'cause if you're not prepared
To let me be your only one

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
But that's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me
I don't wanna get physical
Don't wanna be just ph-physical
I don't wanna get physical, baby
Don't wanna be that typical

Body language says a lot
It's sweet conversation, baby
Feels fine, but it's much better
When you've got mental stimulation
I wanna give you my all
I don't wanna take your body and run
I want you to be my one and only one
I don't wanna be your sexual urge
I want whatever's inside of us to merge

Ph-ph-physical
Yeah
Ph-ph-ph-physical
Don't wanna be just physical
Ph-ph-ph-ph-ph-physical
Well, well, well

Well, physical
I wanna give you my all

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me

I don't wanna get physical, no
It's nothing personal, no
That's how it's gotta be, baby
Just between you and me
