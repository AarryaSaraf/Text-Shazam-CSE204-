Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

We make music without playin' a note
In a private place, together we'll be
Listenin' to a tune somebody wrote
That fits our situation to a T

Yeah, a voice on the stereo singin' softly
Describin' what I feel about you
The singer just seems to know all about it
Seems like the writer must
Have sat down and wrote this song about us

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

Yeah, my kingdom exists wherever you go
I sit down beside you and I'm on my throne
You're my queen and I just want you to know
Your love has been another zone

So into you and I'm with every bit of me
And it's where I want to stay for good
Got a lifetime supply of me to give to you
Let no one tell you this is not it
'Cause when it comes to true love, you know we got it

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

In the room, we're just two silhouettes
The only light is from the fireplace
Ooh, we're close as any two people can get
And a look of love is shimmering on your face

Passionate kiss of fire that you get with me
Arouses me to want to make love
Stimulates my entire sensitivity
Oh, it's so good when we touch
All the time will never be too much
Never, ever be too much

So in love, so in love
So in love, so in love
So in love, in love
So in love, in love, in love

(So in love, in love, in love)
And you and me will always
(So in love, in love, in love)
So in love, baby
Do say you'll always stay
(So in love, in love, in love)

So in love, baby, yeah
So in love, baby, yeah
(So in love, in love, in love)
So in love, baby, yeah
