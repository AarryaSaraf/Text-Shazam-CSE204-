Been having problems with my woman
Been walking the floor
Can't sleep at night
But I know now if we make up
Even if we break up
For me every things gonna be alright

Cause I have prayed on it 
I have turned it over to the only one
Who can solve any problem
I say Father, oh Father, let your will be done

Child is doing drugs and hanging with the wrong crowd
Stead of getting better seems to be getting worse
Did every thing I could but it didn't do no good
So now I've done what I should done first
I got down on my knees and said, help me please

And I prayed on it (I have prayed on it) prayed on it, prayed on it
I have turned it over (I have prayed on it) to the only one
(I have prayed on it) who can solve any problem
And said Father, oh Father, Father, let your will be done

Father, let your will be done (Father let your will be done) in my life

Trouble on your job your boss is so demanding
Your money getting funny and your bills overdue
Your whole life situation is just trial and tribulation
I know one thing that will see you through (ah)
Just go to the place where you fall on your face and you (Have you prayed on it) pray on it
You got to (Have you prayed on it) tell your problem to the only one who can solve any problem
(Have you prayed on it) Father let your will be done
Oh have you prayed on it (Have you prayed on it)
Pray on it, pray on it, pray on it, pray on it, pray on it (Have you prayed on it) (Ah)
Have you gone to the place where you fall on your face and you've prayed on it (Have you prayed on it)
Have you got on your knees and said Father please prayed on it (Ah oh)
(Have you prayed on it) Have you grabbed Jesus' train
Have you grabbed Jesus' train (Have you) (Ah oh) (prayed on it)
Have you prayed on it
