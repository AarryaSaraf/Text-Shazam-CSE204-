Yes, baby...

The guys all fall over each other
Just to get next to you
They try too hard and they smile too much
I admit that I've done it too

How can you blame us for actin' like fools
Hangin' around like we do

When everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

I wish I knew what I could do
To stand out from the crowd, yes
To be the one (that you) you reach out to
And put your arms around

How can you blame me for wanting to be
The only that you see

When everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

Oh, touch me, baby
It would feel so good
Oh, kiss me, baby
'Cause I know it would
Ooh, love me, baby
Come on love me, love me
(Yeah)
Love me, oh
Love me, love me, baby
Ooh... yes

I hope someday I'll wake up and see
The one you're holdin' is me
(Holdin' me)

Everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say sounds so fine
Every time we meet I feel a little lighter
Tell me how can I make you mine

Everything you touch shines a little brighter
Everything you say comes out right
Every time we meet
I feel a little lighter, lighter, lighter
(Tell me how can I)
Tell me how can I make you mine tonight
