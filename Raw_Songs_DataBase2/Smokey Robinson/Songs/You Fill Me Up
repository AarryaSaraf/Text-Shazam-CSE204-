You fill me up all the time
You make my days so much brighter
You fill me up all the way
You make my load so much lighter

Oh and I
I'm so thankful to be loved by
Loved by somebody like you

You fill me up deep down inside
Way way way down you light that flame
You fill me up with a burnin' passion
All you have to do is say my name

Oh and I hope I can be
Whoever it is
Whoever it is you need in me

You fill me up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh my cup of you is overflowing
Yes, and loving you like I do
I tell myself, it's not just for sayin'
You gotta be showin'
Show it, show it, show it, show it, show it, show it

You fill me up
You fill me up
