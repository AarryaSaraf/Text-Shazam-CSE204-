Girl, I'm standing there beside you
This is a decision of my own
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never stand alone

I wanna make love to you
Want to make wild and tender, sweet, sweet love
But whether or not we do
I will never desert or let anything hurt you, ooh...

Girl, I'm standing there beside you
This is a decision of my own
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never stand alone

Some people just love like me
And then hope that they're not being used
Look at me and who do you see
A friend or a tool, a man or a fool, ooh...

Even if you go away
My love will remain
Somewhere deep inside of me
Unpretending, never, never ending

Girl, I'm standing there beside you
If you ever need a helping hand
Girl, I'm standing where, if you only knew
Then you'd know you'll never have to stand alone
As long as there is me
