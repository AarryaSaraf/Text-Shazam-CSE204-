What once was a dream
Will now become
Two hearts
Will now be one, hey

Were gonna write the book on happiness
Pages that time cannot erase
Starting here and now, oh...
Starting here and now, oh...
From this time and place

Oh, what a beautiful day
To take a vow
Pray that the things that we say
Will last from now on
I do take you for mine

Were gonna lock our lives together now
Unshakable, unbreakable embrace
Starting here and now
Starting here and now
Starting here and now
From this time and place

What love has joined together
Only love can put asunder
And we are
What love has joined together
