Bought a pound of writing paper
It's balled up and scattered all around my place
I've been trying to write and say what
I found it hard to tell you face to face

I tried to get real deep and poetic
Put on a little word show
I borrowed from playwrights and poets and songwriters
But I'll just simply say what I want you to know

I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line, well, well

I think a million thought of many
About you and believe me and never fails
To be way too many to mention
But there's one thought that always prevails

I love you so much
I, I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
If I said all the things in my head
That's the bottom line

Why do I do
Things that make me seem so unconfident
A phrase in love has no need to be fancy
It just needs to be truly meant, truly meant
Truly, truly, truly

I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I could preach or say a ten-day speech
If I write every day and all night
If I said all the things in my head
No matter what I do, I just love you
That's the bottom line

I love you so much
Baby, I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line

I love you so much, so much, so much
Love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you so much...
