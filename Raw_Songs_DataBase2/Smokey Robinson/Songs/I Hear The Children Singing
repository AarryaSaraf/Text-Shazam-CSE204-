I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry
I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry

Why did we grow up
What were we thinking of
Why didn't we stay young
And so in love
I hear the children singing
But I hear a tiny voice cry

Why can't I find love
Like we knew
When we were young at play
Will I ever hear the music
Will my sadness stay
I'm only a child
A tiny voice cries

I long to hear the melody
The one we danced to yesterday
When we used to laugh sadness away

I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry

My love remains young
And memories linger on
So a grown-up like me
Is forever a child

I hear the children singing
But amidst the melody
I hear a tiny voice cry
