Baby, I can tell what's wrong
My heart has been cold too long
Come fill me up with love
My heart yearns for passion

Yes, my eyes will soon light up
Tears of joy inside, each drop
Since you came in my life
Things began to happen

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you

You're some kind of lover
Some kind of friend
(Together)
We'll be together till the end
Come fill me up with love
My heart years for passion

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you
(Tearing it apart, tearing it apart, just like you)

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you
(Searching for love, searching for love)

There's a girl on my mind all of the time
Funny, she looks just like you
There's a song in my heart, tearing it apart
Searching for love just like you...
