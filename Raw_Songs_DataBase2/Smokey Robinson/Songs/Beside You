Beside you
That's where I want to be forever
I'm like a soul lost in the river
Searching for a helping hand
Ooh
I love you (yes I love you)
I guess my dear that's why I need you
Please don't leave me bewildered, sad, and blue
Make all my dreams come true

Each night as I lay sleeping
I see no one but you
Oh, I know, if I should bore you
You'd find somebody new

I'd wish you joy
But if you found your new love made you sad and blue
Always remember there's a place in my heart
Place in my heart for you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Beside you, that's where I wanna be forever
I don't ever wanna make you sad or unhappy
I don't wanna make you feel bad
I don't wanna make you uncomfortable
I'll always wanna be beside you

Ooh
Beside you
Yes beside you
I wanna be with you forever
Yes I love you
Love you
Beside you is where I wanna be
Yes, beside you
