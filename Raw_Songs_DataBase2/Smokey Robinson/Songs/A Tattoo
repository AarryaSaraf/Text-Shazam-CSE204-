Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

A tattoo, baby, that's you
The world can see your brand on me
Like a tattoo charm on a sailor's arm
Oh, like an arm tattoo
Oh, baby, that's you

A tattoo, baby, that's you
Deep within, now, under my skin
You can't be erased
No, you can't be replaced
Never can be erased
Ooh, you can't be replaced, no

A tattoo, baby, that's you
A permanent picture
Love painted on it
To say the least, ooh, a masterpiece
Yeah, to say the least
You show a masterpiece, ooh...

Tattoo, ooh, what can I do
You're a true work of art
Etched deep in my heart
You're my tattoo, Mother Nature true
Yeah, and another tattoo
Whole lot more like you, oh, baby

Tattoo, I can't have you
On a look faces show
When your heart isn't gold
Got to be on mind like a neon sign
Oh, got to be on mind like a neon sign
Yeah, got to be on mind like a neon sign

Yeah

Ooh, baby, uh
Alright...
Oh, mama

Tattoo, baby, that's you
Yeah, baby, alright
Oh, alright
Ooh...

Alright, alright, alright
