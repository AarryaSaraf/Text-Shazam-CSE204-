Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ
Don't play another love song

I have always felt from the heart
We're so much more together than we are apart
And I know it's true

While the city sleeps under the stars
And the moon creeps its way across my heart
And the songs we made love to
Are playing in my car

And they break my heart
Got me wonderin' where you are

Please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
It's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Oh, please don't play another love song tonight

And if I ask to much, please understand
That I've lost touch and I might need a hand
And your music has got me missin' her again

And it breaks my heart
Wonderin' where she'll be tonight
Wonderin' where she'll be tonight

Please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
Well, it's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Please don't play another love song tonight
Don't play another love song

I have always felt from the heart
We're so much more together than we are apart, yeah
And I know it's true

So please don't play another love song
Play a broken heart song
Don't make me cry alone
I've got no use for love songs
Now that I'm on my own
It's such a perfect night
To hold somebody tight
Oh, please don't play another love song tonight

Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ
Don't play another love song
Please, Mr. DJ...
