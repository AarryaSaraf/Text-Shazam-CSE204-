Put your love in the light, let it stay there
There's no use going on playing solitaire
Fulfill your need
Fulfill your need

Since love's hurt you so bad, now it's taboo
Come closer now, let me comfort you
Fulfill your need, oh, baby
Fulfill your need

A need can prove costly, yet it isn't worth a cent
If two hearts don't love with a mutual intent
Love needs love and doesn't cost a dime
It's owned by two hearts, working and giving all the time

There's a light burning low in my window
If that old love fire in you can again glow
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need

Ooh, fulfill your need
Oh, baby, fulfill your need, need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need
Oh, baby...
