Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky

Somebody sold you a bill of goods
It turned out bad
But don't you know you're not the only fool
Love ever had
Love let you go
So you're sinking low
But hold on to me and together we can...

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Baby, we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky

Reach up and grab you a piece of it
Take you a share
Don't you know you're within reach of it
From anywhere
You're just out of touch
From hurtin' so much
But take my hand and you know we can...

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Baby, we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky

Ooh, yeah
Touch it, touch it
Baby

Down in the dumps is a crowded place
You're one of the crowd, yeah
Why be among them when you could be
High on a cloud
You're in a rut
How come and for what
You don't have to be
Come lovin' with me

(Touch the sky)
And touch it, touch it, touch it, touch it
(Touch the sky)
You and I can touch the sky
Baby we can both touch the sky
Touch the sky, touch the sky

Ooh, yeah...

Touch it, touch it...

Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Baby, you and I can touch the sky
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah, ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Touch the sky
Touch the sky
You and I could touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it
Touch it, touch it, touch it...
