Well, ooh, baby
(Hurt's on you)
Oh, say it again
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Ooh, baby

Love is full of surprises
For most we don't prepare
It makes a fool of the wisest
And sometimes seems so unfair
How could you lead me on, ooh, baby
Knowing I love so strong
Didn't you notice the pain
That day we stood in the rain and I cried
But you said, "what can I do"

Hurt's on you
I can't help it we're through
Love's put the hurts on you
I don't know what to do
Love's put the hurts on you
Hurt's on you, baby
Yeah

Time brings on many changes
What's up one day is down the next
Cards switch hands, the table rearranges
And now it seems that you're perplexed
I could have told you that
One day, one day you would be back
Now you're feeling the pain
Of the blade that cuts both ways

Hurt's on you
Now you're feeling it too
Love's put the hurts on you
I don't know what you should do
Love's put the hurts on you
Yeah, hurt's on you, baby

(Hurt's on you)
Hurt's on you, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you
(Love's put the hurts on you)
I don't know what you should do
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, 'cause love has hurt me too, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, hurt for you, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
It's your turn to be blue
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Yeah, love has hurt me too, baby
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you
(Love's put the hurts on you)
Hurt's on you, baby...
