Love is five foot somethin' with flashin' eyes
Irresistible merchandise
Love is walkin' towards me with open arms
Settin' off my desire alarm

Yes, it's you lady
Love is you lady, hey
Yes, it's you who can do
The same old things
And make me feel good every time

Fun is magic moments for two, it seems
Sharin' intimate secret dreams
Fun is ten more seconds of touchin'
We never seem to get too much in

Yes, it's you lady, yeah
Fun is you lady
Yes, it's you who can do
The same old things
And make me feel good every time

Every time, every time, yeah
Every time is like the first for me
And I know that I will never be free from you
Free from you, free from you, free from you

Mind reader, my movin' closer is no surprise
You automatically synchronize
Mindblower blew my mind, but before I knew
I had fallen in love with you

Yes, it's you lady, oh
Mind blowin' you lady, baby
Yes, it's you who can do
The same old things
And make me feel good every time
Make me feel good every time

Oh, yes, it's you lady
Love is you lady, yeah, now
Yes, it's you who can do
The same old things
And make me feel good every time
Make me feel good every time

The same old things
And make me feel good every time

Every time, yes, it's you
