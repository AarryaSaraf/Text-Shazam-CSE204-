Softly, softly

Baby, don't cry
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

If you say it's your life
Then I gotta ease your pressure
So that you can see just who I am
And if you say it's our love
Then I gotta make it tighter
But not so tight that you can't breathe
Don't you understand

Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

If you say it's your mind
Then I've got to come inside you
To help you find a way to soothe your thoughts
'Cause those tears that you shed
Just don't become you
So lay down with me in love and we'll get lost

Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm loving you softly
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm not that hard on you
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Your tears just might cost me
Where does it hurt

Oh, show me, baby...

Oh, baby, don't cry
Baby, don't cry, no, no, no
Let me wipe away all your tears
Wash away all your fears
Don't cry no more
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm here, oh...
Don't cry no more, baby
(Baby, don't you cry)
I'm here

Show me where it hurts
(Baby, don't you cry)
Show me
I'll do everything I can for you
(Baby, don't you cry)
You know me
Baby, don't cry
(Baby, don't you cry)
Don't cry no more
Was it something that I did...
