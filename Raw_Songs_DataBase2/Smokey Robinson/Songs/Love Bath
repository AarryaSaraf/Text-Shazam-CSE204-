Let's Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Let's take a love bath baby

Put some water in the tub and do the body rub
Touchin...
Close as can be, I'm touchin you... you're touchin me

Lets take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Lets take a love bath baby

Hot! As a love can be
We got! all the time we need
I- E, don't want to end this night
Soft candlelight, everythings right

Lets take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby

Lets take a love bath baby

[Instrumental]

You, what a wonderful sight
All wet glowin' in the candlelight
I want to stay here forever
I want to see, if you can take all of me

Let's take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Take a love bath baby
Lets take a love bath baby
