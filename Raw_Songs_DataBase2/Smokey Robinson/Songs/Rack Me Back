They called me Good Time Charlie
That's who I was 'til you came along
Now all the girls and guys are so surprised
'Cause Good Time Charlie is gone
There's been a major change somehow
My friends don't even recognize me now

Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Well, well
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over

Now I was no Casanova
But you can believe I've had my share
Until your love took me over
Now nobody else can even compare
Well, you're teaching me what love is about
Your love is wiping everybody out

Rack me back, oh, baby, shake me up, work me over
Oh, rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Well, well, well, well, well

Now I was my own person
And I answered to nobody but me, oh...
I was partying hardy
Foot loose and fancy free
I don't know how you do what you do
But I can't wait to have it being done by you

Rack me back, shake me up, work me over, oh, baby
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Oh, baby, baby, now
Rack me back, shake me up, work me over
Ooh, rack me back, shake me up, work me over...
