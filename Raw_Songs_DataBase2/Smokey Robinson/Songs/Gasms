Eyegasms
When I look at you, it makes me feel better than good
And what I see is you and me together forever
I'm knocking on wood
Every kind of gasm in the book
Each I has 'em everytime I take a look

You give me gasms
Eyegasms
You the one responsible for my gasms
Gasms gasms (Gasms gasms)
Gasms gasms (Gasms gasms)
You give me gasms

Eargasms
When I hear your voice my eardrums start to quiver
It's a sexy sound makes my love come down
And I know, you can deliver
Any kind of gasm on the list
The gasms you don't give me I don't think exists

You give me gasms
Eargasms
Soft and sweet or the kind the neighbors heargasms
If I think about you right now gon give me gasms (Gasms gasms)
Every little thought somehow gon give me gasms (Gasms gasms)
You get those mindgasms, those hard to find gasms
Gasm gasms

Eyegasms, eargasms
Just thinking about you or when you're here gasms
Every kind of gasm ever known
And a few I think are only mine alone

You give me gasms, gasm gasms
You give me gasm gasms, gasms
If I think about you right now gon give me gasms (Gasms gasms)
Every little thought somehow gon give me gasms
You give me those mind gasms
The kind you give me are the kind that are hard to findgasms (Gasms gasms)
Gasm
You give those great gasms
When the mornings early, or when the night is lategasms (Gasms gasms)
You give me those real gasms
The kind that after your gone, but I still can feel gasms (Gasms gasms)
