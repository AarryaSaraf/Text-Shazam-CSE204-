All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

No triangle ties for you and me
No hanky panky
Yes, that was the vow I lived by for you
And how did you thank me
By doing the things we promised each other
We would never do
By running around and painting the town
And breaking my heart in two

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

If you've gotta play, it seems like you
Would be more discreet
And not be so thoughtless enough to expose
Your game in the streets
Now think about me and how it would be
If you were in my place
Just be for real and think how you'd feel
I don't even wanna show my face

Yeah

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free

All my life's a lie
I've been telling everybody
You belong to me
All my life's a lie, my life's a lie
Thinking you were mine and all the time
You've been running free
