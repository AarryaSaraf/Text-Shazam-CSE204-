Winded, weak, lost, bewildered, hurt, all alone
Naked in the wind, tattered, and torn
I know a place where sadness grows small and scatters
Where the joy of love unfolding seems to fill the air

In my corner, love remains
In my corner, loves awaiting you
(Love is waiting for you to call on it, baby)
Loves awaiting you
(Love is waiting for you to call on it, baby)
You, baby

Gentle, and amused, delighted, satisfied
Comforted, and jealous, so highly prized
I know a place a broken heart can be reborn
Empty feelings live again, shattered dreams restored

In my corner, love remains
In my corner, loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Love

Loyalty, security, patience, strength, and trust
Tenderness, and service, safety, and warmth
I know a place that holds these things close and dear
All the best of everything shining bright and clear

In my corner, there you are
In my corner, like a shining star
In my corner, love remains
In my corner, love's awaiting you

Love's awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Tender love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Sweet delicate love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
