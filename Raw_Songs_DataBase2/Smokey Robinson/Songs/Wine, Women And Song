We're the singers in a travelin' show
Pack our bags again and off we go
He gave his ring and love, but this I know

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I say, let's settle down, on this, he declines
For neon lights and no vacancy signs
His wonderland of fame and me he combines

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I wish that we could spend one week alone
Just him and me, but it's so plain to see

That all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

My lady, I've seen all your shows
And wrote you a thousand letters
I sure would love the chance
To make you feel a little better

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

And I want you to be my everything
But he is your man and I'm just a fan

He turns the ladies' heads wherever he goes
On our private life, they even impose
They think I'm lucky, 'cause it's me that he chose

But all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I wish that I could fill his life with love
Sufficiently so he'd only need me

But all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

Wine, women and song are his life
He wants me to just be a wife, yeah
Wine, women and song are his life
Yes, wine, women and song are his life

My lady, I've seen all your shows
And wrote you a thousand letters
I sure would love the chance
To make you feel a little better, yeah

Ah, but he is your man, I'm just a fan
He is your man and I'm just a fan
I think I could make you feel better
But he is your man and I'm just a fan...
