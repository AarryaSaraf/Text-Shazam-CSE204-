Little girl, little girl
Stay away from me, oh
'Cause you know when you come around
It's harder to resist you now, oh
When I first felt grown and left home
You were just a baby
And the last thing on my mind
Was you'd ever be a lady
Little darling, now you're all grown up
And the change is drastic
Got me thinking just to be with you
Would be so fantastic
And I've made up my mind
That the very next time
You look at me the way you do
I'm just gonna say to you, ooh...

Little girl, little girl
I think I've got to have you, yeah
Wonder what your folks would think about
What I'm thinking if they only knew
Would your mama be hurt
Or put herself in your position, uh, uh
'Cause your mama looks so good right now
I know she still get propositioned
And your daddy will be on my side
If he goes by his man thing
Yeah, you're a woman
But the fact that you're his baby
Might cloud his understanding
Still, I've made up my mind
That the very next time
Your passion for me is revealed
I'm gonna show you how I feel

I hope the world don't mind our love
But under the circumstances
I want to be with you so much
'Til I'm gonna take my chances, oh, baby

Little girl, little girl
I'm old enough to be your dad, yeah
But this need that I have for you
Is something that I've never had, oh...
And I've known you such a long, long time
We're almost family
Oh, that makes it just as difficult
As a feeling can be
Still I've made up my mind
That the very next time
You let your feelings for me show
I'm gonna let the world know, oh...

I hope the world don't mind our love
(I wanna be with you, baby)
But under the circumstances, yeah, yeah
I want to be with you so much
'Til I'm gonna take my chances
Take my chances, baby

I hope the world don't mind our love
But under the circumstances
I want to be with you so much
I'm gonna take my chances
Take my chances, baby...
