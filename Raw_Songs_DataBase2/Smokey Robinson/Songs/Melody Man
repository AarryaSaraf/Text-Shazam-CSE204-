Now you don't have a particular lyric
And they don't necessarily rhyme
But it's always the same old story
And it breaks my heart every time

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Now you don't have a particular tempo
And you're not necessarily fast
But my keeping up with you is such a hard thing
Like a man with his leg in a cast

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Well, well, well
You can play me anyway you want to
You can play me anyway you can, baby
Play me anyway you want to, baby
I'm your melody man
Play me, baby, play me

Play me, baby, play me

Well, now, you're the one musician who can play me
And I've never been played this way
And you know that all you have to do is touch me
And I play whatever you say

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Ooh, play me anyway you want to
You can play me anyway you can, oh, baby
Play me anyway you want to
'Cause I'm your melody man
Baby, I'm your melody man

Play me, baby, play me
Play me loud in front of the crowd
Play me, baby, play me
Play me tender, make me surrender
Play me tender, make me surrender
'Cause, baby, I'm your melody man
Oh, baby, I'm your melody man

Oh, play me, baby, play me
Play me loud in front of the crowd
Play me, baby, play me
Play me tender, make me surrender
Play me tender, make me surrender
'Cause, baby, I'm your melody man
Ooh, baby, I'm your melody man

Melody man
I'm your melody man
Melody man
I'm your melody man
Play me, baby, play me...
