Rain, rain, go away
Sunshine, I miss you
It keeps on raining
And into each rain, some life must fall

This time it's mine, maybe one day
You'll know your stormy Monday
Right now your sun seems to shine
But you just might have your rainy Georgia night

'Cause it keeps on raining
And raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall, fall

Some stormy person has the power
To start your April shower
Yes, and that old storm seems to worsen
You can't remember if it's April or December

Ooh, it keeps on raining and raining
And raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall
Fall, fall (rain)

Rain, rain, go away
Sunshine, I miss you

I keep crying and crying and crying
Yes, and even a house of stone
Will surely weaken
When the roof is leaking

Yes, it keeps on raining and raining
And raining and raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall
I tell you, into each rain, some life must fall, fall

Into each rain, some life must fall
