You don't need words to sing along
'Cause this is just a humming song
I tried to write a verse for you
My mind was blank, no words came through

I searched for words to say just how I feel
Whenever you are near
You are the melody in harmony with me

Mmm-hmm-hmm...

Lost for words, all I feel is a melody, hey
Lost for words, all I feel is a melody

I hear a new song everyday
Inspired by the words you say
Your song of love plays on and on
Oh, our love is all in song

There are no words that can't express the joy
You brought into my life
You' re the melody in harmony with me

Mmm-hmm-hmm...
