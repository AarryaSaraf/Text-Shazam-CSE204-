Making love to you is dynamite
Just a touch can make my soul ignite
Then you kiss me and you light the fuse
Kiss me, woman, yeah
Our lips were made to use, ooh, baby
I can't wait 'til the fire goes to the load
That makes the love we feel inside explode

Ooh, baby, it's dynamite, dynamite
Girl, I love it when you blow my mind

Making love to you is T-N-T
That explodes into ecstasy, oh...
Don't you want to feel that feeling too
Feel it woman, yeah, while I'm close to you, oh...
What's the deal, that power you possess
That blasts me off to joy and happiness

Ooh, baby, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite
Girl, I love it when you blow my mind

Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby

Ooh, could it be that you and me
'Cause some kind of force that has a strong reaction
All I know is what I feel
To be with you means total satisfaction

I come to you with true love and that's a fact
All the king's men and horses couldn't hold me back
Oh, I can't wait to be close as we can get
Anticipation of you has me so upset

Ooh, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite, ooh...
I love it when you blow my mind, ah...
It's dynamite, oh, girl, it's dynamite
I love it when you blow my mind
Blow me away

Blow me away, baby
Blow me away, baby
Ah, blow me away, baby
Ah, blow me away, baby

Ooh, it's dynamite
Oh, girl, it's dynamite
I love it when you blow me away
Blow me away
Blow me away, baby...
