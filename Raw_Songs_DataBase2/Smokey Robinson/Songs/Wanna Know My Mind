Wanna know what I think about
When my day is beginning
Wanna know how come I'm tripping out
When my head starts to spin around

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind

Wanna know what I am inside
And if outside is a cover
Of all of the people I may display, yeah
Whether I'm one or the other

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind

Nobody else should know
Nobody but you, the joy I'm thinking
I should have told you so
But you know, you've been running some
And making it hard for me to show you
Where I'm coming from, yeah, yeah

Nobody but you should know
The joy I'm thinking, baby
But you know, you've been running some
And making it hard for me to tell you
Where I'm coming from, no

Wanna know what I think about
When lost in deep concentration
Ooh, unlock my head and check it out
You know you've got the right combination

Wanna know my hopes and aims
Wanna know my goal
Wanna know my joys and pains
Wanna know my soul

Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind
Do you wanna know my mind, oh...
Wanna know my mind, ooh...

Wanna know my mind, ooh...
Wanna know my mind, baby
Wanna know my mind
Wanna know my mind...
