You see, love is so close
Turn out the lights
Just a touch away
I got love on my mind
Just you and me
No need to rush this feeling
We're just a touch away
We'll just take our time

Girl, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
It's just a touch away
(Just a touch away, baby)

Turn on the music
Let the feeling grow
Let's get into the rhythm
Take it nice and slow

Baby, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

Ooh, baby, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

Ooh, baby, I'm reaching out for you
Come to me now
We're so close, we're so close

So close, ooh, yeah

Ooh, yes, it's you and me all night
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

(All night)
All night long
Holding each other so tight
Love is so close
We're just a touch away

(Just a touch away, baby)
Just a touch, just a touch
(Just a touch away)
Ooh-wee, baby
(Just a touch away, baby)
Just a touch
(Just a touch away)
Oh yeah

Just a touch away, baby
(Just a touch away, baby)
Yeah
(Just a touch away)
Just a touch away
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
(Just a touch away, baby)
Ooh, just a touch away
(Just a touch away)
You'll need me, baby, yeah...
