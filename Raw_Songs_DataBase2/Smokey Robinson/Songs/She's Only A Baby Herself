Bad boy, made love to my daughter
What's your mind daddy gonna do
Shame on you, oh, yeah
Bad boy, bad boy, stole my baby's mind
Then you had to take her body, too
Shame on you, oh, Lord

Well, now, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself

I think back, think back, sixteen years ago
Her mama smiled, 'cause she gave to this world
A fine girl, oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Whoo, and now, now, now, now, right now
I see her mama cry
Thinking that she's failed and it's her fault
The girl got caught
Her little girl got caught

And now, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my child, my child, ooh, yeah
And she's only a baby herself

That's the song of the father
Of the girl who gave in
To the boy who made her feel like a woman
And this song may be sad
But he knows in his heart
He's gonna love that little baby that's coming

My daughter's gonna have a baby
Oh, and she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Oh, my child, my child, yeah...
