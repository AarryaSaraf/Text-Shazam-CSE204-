Answer the phone, it's only me
All I wanna do is talk to my children, oh, yeah, yeah
Don't want to bother her or you, my man, no, no
But if you have a man at all, you'll understand
Ooh, the problems between her and me
They are foolish things that we did, oh

Haven't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no
Haven't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids

Even the judge, he understood now
Gave me the right to see 'em, at least on the weekend
Oh, now, buddy, you got the woman now
She chose to let me go, ah...
But if you love my kids at all, you got to know
Oh, but there's an ocean between her and me
Made of tears we often hid, ooh...

That ain't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no, now
That ain't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids

As long as I respect your home
And don't come around
Trying to cause you pain and misery, ooh...
I got the right to be with them
Oh, they got the right to be with me
I'm talkin' 'bout the kids, man
They got the right to be with me, oh...

I, I, I, I don't use my kids
For no excuse to spy on you, no
Prying into your private life
Is something I won't do, oh...
But when the woman and I broke up
Of each other we got rid, oh...

But that ain't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no, now
That ain't got a thing to do with the love...
That ain't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids
