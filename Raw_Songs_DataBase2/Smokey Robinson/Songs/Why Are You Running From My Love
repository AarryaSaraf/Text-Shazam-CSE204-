Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

Could it be love has played
A cruel game on you
Did you believe in dreams
That never did come true
Then someone caught your heart
To end your lonely nights
Whispering promises
That faded with the light

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

Girl, I know what it's like
To watch my castles fall
Thought I had love for sure
I had nothing at all
So I turned off my heart
Claimed that this was the end
But now that you're in my life
I want to love again

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of
Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of

We've both known pain
Let's now know joy
Don't let our sorrows
Ruin our tomorrows now

Why are you running from my love
What could you think I'm thinking of, thinking of
Why are you running
What could you think I'm thinking of

Why, why, why, why, why
Why are you running from my love

You know you're out
Stopping me to count on time, ooh, baby
You know you're out
Stopping me to count on time, ooh, baby

Why, oh, why, oh
(Why are you running)
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, why
(Why are you running)
I wanna love again
I wanna love again, I wanna love again
(Why are you running)
I wanna again
(Why are you running)
Why, oh, why, oh...
