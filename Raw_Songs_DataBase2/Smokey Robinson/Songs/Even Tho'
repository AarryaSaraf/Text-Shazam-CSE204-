Even tho' love was just a game to me
You are my lady, I can't set you free
Even tho' at times, I broke our sacred vow
I needed you then, I need you now
Even tho' your tears flow like falling rain
I'll kiss you, love you, wipe away your pain
Even tho', even tho', even tho'

Ooh, baby, baby, don't leave me to cry
It's still a great love affair
I've been the fool, I've been the fool
Even tho' we almost made it there

Ooh, baby, baby, don't leave me to cry
It's still a great love affair
I've been the fool, I've been the fool
Even tho' we almost made it there

Stay here with me, lady
Walk with me through sun and rain
I'll make you happy, my lady
Love will never be the same
Even tho', even tho', even tho'
Even tho', even tho', even tho'
Even tho', even tho', even tho'
