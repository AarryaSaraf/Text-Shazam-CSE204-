Oh, oh, oh... baby

I don't know where you've been
All I know is when
We said goodbye, we thought it was forever
Others we both have tried
Just made us both decide
Our happiness is when we are together

Love, love made us feel so right
Feel so right, oh...
Love, love was our guiding light
Oh, yeah
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here tonight

It could be loneliness
Or a test to see who's the best
Or two people's prayers that didn't go unheard
There are many reasons why
We might be here, but I
Think I can sum them up in just one word

Love, love made us feel so right
Love, love was our guiding light
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here

No doubt in my mind
We were meant to be
I was led to you
You were sent to me

Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Love brought us here
Oh, brought us here tonight

Love, love made us feel so right, yeah
Oh, love, love was our guiding light
So there's nothing to fear
'Cause love brought us here

Love, love made us feel so right
Made everything feel right
Sing it, sing it, sing it to me
Love, love brought us here tonight
Let me feel your love
(Feel it, feel, feel)
I wanna feel your love
Love, love made us feel so right
Love, love, love, love, love
Oh, oh, love
Love, love was our guiding light
Let me feel it, let me feel it...
