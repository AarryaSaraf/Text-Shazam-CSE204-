I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you all the time

Here they go again
Thoughts of you and me
Lovin' there and then
Wherever we might be
Simple things like touching in public
Private touches goin' unseen
A look that says what goes without sayin'
But I know what you mean
You know what I mean

I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you all the time

Here I go again
Dreaming while awake
My mind is racing like the wind
I can't put on the brake
The signal says "proceed with all caution"
Get out and run right through
'Cause I can't wait to get to that feelin'
I only know when I'm with you

Oh, I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
Calling you all the time

(Come on baby keep it comin')
(Come on baby keep it comin')

I keep calling you baby
I keep calling you in my mind
I keep calling you baby
Calling you all the time

(Come on baby keep it comin')
(Come on baby keep it comin')

I keep calling you baby
Calling you baby
Calling you baby
Calling your name
