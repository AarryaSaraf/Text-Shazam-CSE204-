You may dismiss me as unimportant
A guy who's only in the corner of your eye
Right now I know I'm just a fleeting moment
I'm just an easy friend on whom you can depend

But darling, there will come a day, oh
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
Oooooh baby

I only see you in little glimpses
We work together in a world of nine to five
While I'm daydreamin' of champagne and kisses
You pass right by me, hardly know that I'm alive

But darling, there will come a day, oh
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
Oooooh

Oh baby, oh baby
Oooooh oh oh baby
Yeah

I only see you in little glimpses
We work together in a world of nine to five
While I'm daydreamin' of champagne and kisses
You pass right by me, hardly know that I'm alive

But darling, there will come a day, baby
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
To you, to you

There will come a great big day, yeah
When you look at me, my baby, another way
There will come a day, baby
Look at me, look at me

There will come a time, baby
When I'll be all yours, you'll be mine, baby
There...
