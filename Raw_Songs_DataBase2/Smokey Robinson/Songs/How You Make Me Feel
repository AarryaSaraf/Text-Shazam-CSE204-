When you get that look on
I could write a book on
All the ways I'm hooked on

How you make me feel
How you make me feel

Got my motor running
One touch and I'm done in
So much sexy fun in

How you make me feel
How you make Me feel

You make me feel like everything's okay everyday
You make me feel like everything's alright every night
I'm addicted to you
Nothing about me is restricted to you
I can't wait to see what you're fixing to do

Cause I know
Whatever it is
Is gonna feel better
Said I know
Whatever it is
Is gonna feel better
Better better better better

Don'tcha know you make me
Feel like everything's alright every night
