Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand
Oh, no

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Blown apart
By strong ocean breeze
Scattered, scattered
In a million tiny pieces
Unstable, unable

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Washed away
When the tide starts to change
And nothing left, nothing, no, nothing
Not a trace of where it stood
Weak foundations, mere imitation

Well, if our love is made of sand
Then let it be a desert land
A desert land
Let it be strong and free
And wide and warm
Like a desert land

Castles made of sand
Don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

(Castles made of sand)
No, no, don't let our love be like
Castles made of sand

Castles made of sand
(Don't let our love be made of sand)
Castles made of sand
(Not yours and mine)
Castles made of sand

Let it be strong and wide
Free and warm
Like a desert land
(Castles made of sand)
Don't let our love be made of sand

Oh, baby, don't let our love be made of sand
(Castles made of sand)
Let it be strong and wide
Warm and free
