Watch what you say
You gotta speak with a little more discipline
Our little brothers and sisters are listening
There's a subtler way
That you can say any idea you want to express
You can tell them of love without every detail
And let life and time do the rest
Some don't know the meaning of everything you say
But they repeat you anyway

So you've gotta be kind to the growing mind
Said you gotta be kind to the growing mind

Watch what you do
Think of the future, people, you may be creating
Our little brothers and sisters are imitating
You're a who's who, they wanna be like you
So set a positive example
Life is a pie you don't eat all at once
Every now and then you taste another sample
Soon enough, they start to find out
What it's all about

So we gotta be kind to the growing mind
Said we gotta be kind to the growing mind

Think about it, everybody

Watch what you say
You gotta watch what you say and what you do
Our little brothers and sisters look up to you
Now you can be sexy, it's alright especially
When it's done at the right time and place
Try to remember that a young mind
Is a terrible thing to waste
Let us remember it's up to you and me
It's our responsibility

Yeah, we gotta be kind to the growing mind
You're little brothers and sister need you to be
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
You and me, gotta be
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
Temptations, tell them, oh, yeah
We gotta be kind to the growing mind
Oh, we gotta be kind to the growing mind
You and me, gotta be, kind, kind, kind
We gotta be kind to the growing mind...
