Strange how we move through life
Feeling in the dark
Seeking to be a winner
But missing the mark
Then someone comes along
Like magic they appear
All of the shadows fade
And everything is clear

That's what you've done to me
Since you have come to me

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light

I, I was a one-man band
A loner for so long
I thought I was so in tune
But I was off-key and wrong
You, you brought to my song
Joy I could never find
Melodies haunt my heart
Sweet music divine

Oh, what you've done to me
Since you have come to me

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light
(The light)
Light, light

All the lonely nights
Filled with fear
One touch from you
And they all disappear
My fears all disappear

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and tender light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light, oh...

Love is the light
(I've seen the light)
That leads the way
(I've seen it shining so bright)
A glow of light, sweet love
Sweet love, sweet love
(So warm and lovely)
Warm and lovely light
(I've seen the light)
The blessing of love tonight
Love is the light

I've seen the light
I've seen it shining so bright
A glow of light
So warm and lovely
I've seen the light
Love is the light

I've seen the light
I've seen it shining so bright
A glow of light
