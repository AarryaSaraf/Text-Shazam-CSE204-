Share it
Come on, share this night with me
Share it
Come on, share this night with me

Baby, come share it with me
Don't you know that we've got nothing to lose
But it's pretty plain what we stand to gain
And it's something everybody can use

Baby, share it
Come on, share this night with me
Whoa, baby, share it
Come on, share this night with me
Baby, ooh, baby

Baby, come share it with me
Give a little and get some in return
And what we don't know about each other
What a perfect opportunity to learn, ooh...

Oh, baby, share it
Come on, share this night with me
Come on, share it with me, baby
Come on, share it with me, baby
Oh, baby, please give me one fine night of sunshine
Give me one fine night of sunshine
Share it with me, baby

Slow rock, y'all, yeah
Rock, rock
Ooh, yeah

Baby, come on
Give me one fine night of sunshine
Give me one fine night of sunshine

Slow rock, y'all
Rock
Rock, rock

Rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock

Oh, baby, share it
Come on, share this night with me
Come on, share it with me, baby
Come on, share this night with me
Come on, share it with me, baby
Oh, baby, please give me one fine night of sunshine
Give me one fine night of sunshine
Share it with me, baby
Come on, share it with me, baby...
