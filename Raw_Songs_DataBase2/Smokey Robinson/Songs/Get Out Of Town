Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move, baby
If you're gonna be in this vicinity
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Lover, you got just about an hour
Before I get home and take a shower
Watchin' the clock tick-tock and steady
For makin' love, I'm makin' ready
With you I'm plannin' some delight tonight
You got it comin' and, oh

I maybe here to get it now
Oh, please, say you'll stay
It's gonna be a guess so you can bet it now
But if you think, 'no', then go

Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move, baby
If you're gonna be in this vicinity
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Hey, lover, lover, I feel sensuous and tingly
Thinkin' how you look lookin' at me
Not worth a 'maybe' or an 'I might'
Your eyes are givin' me the 'go' light
And I better mind, that look is genuine
Looks like you want me 'cause

Hey, your smile is so inviting now
I don't have no way
Think makin' love with you would be exciting now
But if you think I'm wrong, so long

Get out of town, go catch your plane
Hop on a bus or take a train, baby
Get out of town, if you remain, baby
I'm tellin' you before the evening is through
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

Ooh, lover, you can be talkin' 'bout the weather
And really be sayin', let's get together
It's not what you say but how you say it
And I want it too so I'll obey it
That certain sound that keeps me hangin' around
Is drawin' me to you, hon

Yeah, I'm comin' at you now
Oh, I'm on my way
You'll always be mine if I can get you more
So take me on or be gone

Get out of town, get on the road
You better leave if you don't want this passion
Get out of town, get on the move
If you're gonna be in this locality
You know that I'm gonna track you down and love you, girl

So good
So good
So good
So good

Get out of town
(Get out of town)
Get out of town
(Get out of town)
