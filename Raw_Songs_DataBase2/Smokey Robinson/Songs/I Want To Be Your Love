I want to be your love, I need to
I am the bearer of this need to need you
I used to be a sailor on the sea of life
When love's waters got too deep, I always sailed
It never failed

But now I want to stay right here and touch you
(To stay right here)
'Cause I could never get too much you
I may be the secret love of all your fantasies
But I hope I can fulfill at least a few
If you only knew

How much I want to be your love
(I want to be your love)
I want to be your love, yes, I do
(I want to be your love)

I'll be good to you
I'll be sweet and gentle and kind, yes, I will
Let me be your love
Truer love you'll never find
Never, never

Old fickle me, who's wanted to be
So many things in life
At last I think I found what's best for me
My destiny

I want to be your love
(I want to be your love)
Please, let me
(I want to be your love)
Oh, if you really want me
(I want to be your love)
You know you can get me
(I want to be your love)
So let me be your love, your love
(I want to be your love)

I'll be good to you
I'll be sweet and gentle and kind, ooh, baby
Just let me be your love
Truer love you'll never find
Let me be your love...
