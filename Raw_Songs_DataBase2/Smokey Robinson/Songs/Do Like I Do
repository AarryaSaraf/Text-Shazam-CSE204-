You got to do like I do, oh, like I do
When we're far apart and your lonesome heart
Makes your eyes wander to somebody new
You might want them so much, you can look but, oh, don't touch

You got to do like I do, recognize desire as a physical need
That you can rise above, oh, like I do
Don't love the one you're with? Search 'til you get with the one you love
Oh, like I do, you got to do like I do

When you're out with your friends and the coupling off begins
And the heavy rappers start to hit on you
If the question is romance, let the answer be, "No chance"
Do like I do, let it in one ear, right past your smile out of the other

Oh, like I do, don't let another lost soul
Talk you into going undercover, do like I do

I know gossip would take a love so good
And spread the proof of one of us is playing, they been saying
Oh, don't give me that he said, that she said that they said, that we said
On it goes

How the stories starts and stops, nobody knows
But I got my baby
Check them so they know that they can go 'til it freezes over
Oh, like I do

Even if they try 'til the fourth of July
Comes in our door, yeah
They never gonna break us up
If you do like I do

Like I do, oh
Like I do, oh
You got to do like I do
Do like I do
