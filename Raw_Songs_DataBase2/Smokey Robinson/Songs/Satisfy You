I would
If I could
Find a hundred other undiscovered ways
To satisfy you

Everyday
Right away
When I wake up
I make up my mind
To satisfy you

In my Head
In my Bed
I'm the only person
Who knows just what to do
To satisfy you

Your satisfaction and what you need
Is important to me
I'm doing my best
To plant a seed

So love can grow
And you can know
In your Mind in your Body
In your Heart and Soul
In life my road
My Aim my Goal
Is to satisfy you

Get timing now
Play
Yeah

Your satisfaction and what you need
Is important to me
I'm doing my best
To plant a seed

So love can grow
And you can know
In your Mind in your Body
In your Heart and Soul
In life my road
My Aim my Goal
Is to satisfy you
