Ooh, baby...

Are we lovers forever
Or just borrowing days
I know when we're together
Feels like something that should last always
Temporary temptation
Or a permanent joy
Should I make preparation
To be cast aside like broken toy

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Ooh, baby
I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Ooh, baby

From the middle of nowhere
Through the outskirts of bliss
To the inroads of heaven
When my lips feel your kiss
Just how far have I traveled
Where have you taken me
Will love's riddle unravel
Or forever be a mystery

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
Oh, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, I love the nearness of you, baby, yeah

Ooh, if we ever got parted
I'd be lost, that's a fact
How we ever got started
Well, as I look back to be exact

I don't know, tell you, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you

I don't know too much about it
But I know I can't do without it
I know is that I love, I love the nearness of you, yeah
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that I love the nearness of you, baby, oh...

I love the nearness of you, baby, yeah
Ooh, I love the nearness of you, ooh...
I don't know too much about it
But I know I can't do without it
I know, I know I love the nearness of you, baby...
