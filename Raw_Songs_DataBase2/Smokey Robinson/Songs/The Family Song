Gemini and Aquarius
Well, I'm talking 'bout
Leo the Lion and Sagittarius
What a groovy combination
Dig that foursome, yeah
Living in a four-way situation
'Til some more come

Two guys and two girls together
In one love that's strong
Singing that family song
Yeah, singing that family song

First the Twins met the Waterman
Waterman said, "Twins
I'm gonna make you mine if I can"
Then one day soon, the Lion
Raised his head and roared aloud
(Uh-huh, now)
And Waterman and Twins
Were feeling mighty, mighty proud
And by and by
The Archer let the arrow fly
(Yes, he did now)
And made four where there was three
And made sure that there would be

Two guys and two girls together
In one love that's strong, yeah
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song

Gemini and Aquarius
Well, I'm talking 'bout
Leo the Lion and Sagittarius
A groovy combination, air and fire
Of each other, they should never tire, no

Two girls and two guys together
In one love that's strong, yeah
Singing that family song
Singing that family song
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song, ooh...
Singing that F-A-M-I-L-Y, family song
...
