Trying it again
This time I've gotta win
I'm trying again to reach your love
The signs of time were wrong
You couldn't belong
You felt your high was much above
Though in your heart you knew what to do, well
You wouldn't listen to what it said
Your mind took control of body and soul
And caused you to be misled

But I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love, yeah
I'm trying to reach your love, baby

Well, I'm calling on you, girl, to be my world
Every ocean, very continent
Be the sky, be the sun, be my all, be my one
The one that heaven must have sent
You get low, you got class
Take it slow, you're too fast
There's time to do it all
Baby, now is the time
Take your love, make it mine
Why don't you hear my call

'Cause I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love, oh...
I'm trying to reach your love, baby
Reach you love, yeah
I'm trying to your love, baby

I'm trying to your love

Oh, I'm gonna keep trying
There's no, no, denying
I'm try, try, trying to reach your love
I'm trying to reach your love, baby
Trying to reach your love, baby

I'm trying to reach your love
I'm trying it again, yeah
Trying to reach your love, baby
Yeah, yeah
I'm trying to reach your love
Trying it again
Oh, trying to reach your love, baby
Trying it again...
