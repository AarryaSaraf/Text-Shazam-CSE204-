It's a good night for staying at home
A good night for doing the town
A good night for living it up
And it's a good night for settling down

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

It's a good night for parties and fun
A good night to get some exposure
A good night be with someone
Snuggled up in a little enclosure

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

I woke up this morning
And I look so forward to
This evening coming
So that I could be with you
Tonight has been given
To do what we want to do
Morning, be my friend
And take your time dawning in

It's a good night, don't leave it too fast
Don't let it end too soon
A good night, please let it last
At least 'til tomorrow or noon, ooh...

Good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right, ooh...
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

Oh, it's a good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me, baby, well
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right

Ooh, it's a good night, baby
So right, baby, baby
A good night, baby
So right for everything
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Except for you and me saying goodnight
Don't say goodnight, baby
That wouldn't be right, ooh...
Don't say goodnight, ooh, baby
That wouldn't be right

Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, ooh

Don't say goodnight
Ooh, baby
Don't say goodnight, ooh
That wouldn't be right, no, baby
Don't say goodnight, ooh...
That wouldn't be right
Ooh, baby
That wouldn't be right
Ooh, don't say goodnight...
