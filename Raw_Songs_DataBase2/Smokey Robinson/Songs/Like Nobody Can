Moment to moment, you fill my hour
Like nobody can, oh, baby
You can make me feel love's power
Like nobody can, oh, baby

Two people love and don't know why
Just because they are wherever they may be
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
And I love you because you're you
Oh, darlin', and because I'm me

Oh, lean on me 'cause it's only those we love
Who comfort leanin' like nobody can
Life is only life but for me
You give it meaning like nobody can

I mean these things, I mean every word
No sense wastin' breath just sayin' words that may sound good
If there's no substance there, ooh
So I express myself by sayin' what you make me feel
It's comes from deep inside somewhere, oh

It's heavy to discover that your lover can make you sad
Really sad like nobody can
We'll go back and lay down beside you and proceed to
Make you happy and you're happy that somebody can
Somebody can

You do it for me, baby
And you do it for me, baby, ah, yeah, yeah
(Like nobody can)
You take my heart and soul, mind and body
And make me feel good, oh, you make me feel good
(Like nobody can)
