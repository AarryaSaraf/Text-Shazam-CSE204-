Now I'm not a stranger to feeling good
Neither devil nor angel am I
I may not have loved as many as I could
But you're one of the ones I just had to try

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

Ooh-wee, baby

The number one song's on the radio
I've heard it a thousand times or more
Why it sounds better, I don't really know
But it's never sounded quite this good before

Before we touched, before we kissed
It never sounded quite like this
One more time, play it again
That's the best it's ever been
You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

The whole world seems brand new
I feel like I do, because of you
Because of you, because of you

So strange
But just because of you
Everything I do
It's just like I've never
(Never, never, never)
I've changed
I'm like a brand new me
All feelings seem to be
Better than ever
Better than ever

The whole world seems brand new, whole world
I feel like I do, because of you
Because of you, because of you

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been
You touched me once, you touched me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
That's the best it's ever been

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been
You loved me once, you loved me twice
(Never been better)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been

You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
(Kiss me, kiss me)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(Oh, babe)
That's the best it's ever been
You loved me once, you loved me twice
(Love me, oh, yeah)
The second time was twice as nice
One more time, do it again
(One more, do it)
That's the best it's ever been...
