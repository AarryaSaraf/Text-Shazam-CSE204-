Gone again
You never seem to need me
'Til I'm gone again
I remember when
I had never gone from you before

Every now and then
At night I wake up crying
'Cause I'm gone again
And, lately, where I've been
Makes me need to be with you once more

But makin' up and breakin' up
Is taking up too much of our precious time
So this time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again

Oh, but makin' up and breakin' up
Is taking up too much of our precious time
So this time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again

This time, I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again
I'm gonna wait 'til when
I'm gonna wait 'til when
I can return and never be gone again, again
Gone, gone again
