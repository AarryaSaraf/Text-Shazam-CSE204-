Ooh, baby

Two hearts, two of a kind
Love at first sight, why do they say love is blind
Slow down, we don't have to move fast
'Cause the love that is real is made to last

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

We paint a picture walkin' down the street
Leaves are fallin', baby, so are we
Hand in hand, that's the way it should be
How could somethin' so easy make me feel so complete

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

Take it easy, oh
I want o feel your every emotion
Don't talk
And we'll makin' love in slow motion
Oh, slow motion, baby
Oh, slow motion, baby

Take it one heartbeat at a time
Close your eyes and let your soul unwind
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat

One heartbeat at a time
One heartbeat
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat

One heartbeat
One heartbeat
Sooner or later it'll all fall in line
If we take it one heartbeat
If we take it at a time
