Nothing I can say against the man you love
Nothing I can say, 'cause I don't blame you
For feeling like I do
Your man happens to be my best friend, no, no, no
The only hang-up is I love you too

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

Vividly I can remember when he and I were boys
'Cause that was when he gave me my very first clue
While rapping about the woman
Who would share our future lives
We both painted a picture that is you

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

It could have been worse
I mean, what if a stranger had found you first
Since it wasn't me, then I'm glad it was him
'Cause to know you this way is better
Than never to know you at all

A thousand times I've asked myself
If I'd take you if I could
But I'm sworn to silence by the unspoken oath
If we three could talk about it
It might do me some good
But I fear to speak might make me lose you both

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
I'm a silent partner in a three-way love affair
Silent partner, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

A silent partner in a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner
Silent partner

A silent partner in a three-way love affair
