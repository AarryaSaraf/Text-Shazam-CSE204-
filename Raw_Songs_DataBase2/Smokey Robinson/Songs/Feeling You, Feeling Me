I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
The tenderness, the thought
The dream I've always sought, I see

Emotions clearly state what both of us are feeling
Words would get in the way, your moves are so revealing
I like your look of love and it's reciprocal
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
We touch, we understand
With words unspoken, we agree

This magic moment brings a unique sensation
And I'm responding to the soul of your vibration
I see your eyes aglow and I know that you know
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

Of you feeling me
Feeling me, feeling you

Yes, baby, ah, yes, baby
Feeling you, feeling me

It's always happening in storybooks and movies
And now it's happening to me and, ooh, it sure is groovy
I like your look of love and it's reciprocal
Hush now, don't say you care, my whole being is aware

Of you feeling me
Feeling me, feeling you
I'm feeling you
Feeling me, feeling you
Feeling you
I'm feeling you

Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling you, feeling me
Feeling, feeling
Feeling me, feeling you, feeling me
Feels so good...
