Yeah, little darling
Little darling, little darling

Even mountains will crumble
Rivers will dry and stars will fall
And the kings will be humble
The meekest of men will be standing tall
Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything

But you are forever
Baby, you are my now and then, oh...
You are forever
Darling, I cannot remember when
I didn't, ooh... love you

Yesterday is a memory
Tomorrow will come and fade away
But my love is eternal
I promise you it will always stay, oh...
Time changes, rearranges
Things come and go, but one thing I know is

You are forever
Baby, you are my now and then, oh...
You are forever
And, darling, I cannot remember when
I didn't want you, need you, love you
Yes, love you, ah, love you, love you, love you

Time changes, rearranges
Mountains and kings, everything

But you are forever, ooh, baby
Baby, you are my now and then
You're forever and ever and ever
I cannot remember when
I didn't love you, really love you

You're forever and ever
Baby, baby, ever, ever, and ever and ever
I, I cannot remember when
I didn't, ooh... love you
Ooh, love you, love you, love you
Can't remember when I didn't love you
Love you, love you, love you, yeah
Love you, all my life it seemed I love you
Even high in the breeze, I love you...
