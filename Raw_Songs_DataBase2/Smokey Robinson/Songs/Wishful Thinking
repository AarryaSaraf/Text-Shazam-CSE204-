The night's electric
When I'm dancin' close to you
It's just like magic
A feeling too good to be true
And when I kiss you
Girl, it feels so wonderful
You say you love me
It's like some kind of miracle

Then I realize
I'm just a victim of imagination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin'
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin'

You're my obsession
But you don't even know I'm there
I'm lost inside this
Imaginary love affair, hey
Guess I should give up
But then again you never know
So I keep dreamin'
About you when I should let go

It feels so real
When I'm caught up in this fascination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin'
It's only wishful thinkin'
(Only wishful)
Just a fantasy, you love me too, girl
It's only wishful thinkin', alright
Wishin' you loved me is all I do, girl

Hey, then I realize
I'm just a victim of imagination

It's only wishful thinkin'
Just a fantasy, a sweet illusion
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
And though you don't love me
I can't help dreamin', oh, yeah
It's only wishful thinkin', baby
Just a fantasy, you love me too, girl
It's only wishful thinkin'
Wishin' you loved me is all I do, girl...
