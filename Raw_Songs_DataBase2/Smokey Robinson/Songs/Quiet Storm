Soft and warm a quiet storm
Quiet as when flowers talk at break of dawn, break of dawn
A power source of tender force generatin', radiatin'
Turn me on, turn them on

You short-circuit all my nerves
Promising electric things
You touch me and suddenly there's rainbow rings

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Oh, blow baby

Windy sigh, weaken my
Butterfly caught up in a hurricane, hurricane
Lucky me, I'm better free
Suddenly I'm caught up in your somber rain

Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my life

Shower me with your sweet love
I will bathe in every drop
Through all the seasons let it pour and never stop

Quiet storm, blowin' through my life, through my life
You're just like a quiet storm, blowin' through my life
Blow baby, blow baby
