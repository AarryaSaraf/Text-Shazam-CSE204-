It's no good, it's no fun
You're unhappy with ten secret loves
If your lover has one
It's no fair, you say there's no way
You're unhappy with all of the rules
When your lover starts to play, starts to play
All the little games that you've been playing
Two can play the game, there's an old, old saying
What you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby

There's no tears, there's no laughter
True love leaves you and you're just a shell
For the ones who come after
The ones who come after
Every square inch of ground you cover
Will circle back to hunt you down, lover
What you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby, oh...

Yeah

There's no joy, no smile
It's no fun taming all your playthings
If your real thing runs wild, runs wild
Think about it, baby
That's all you gotta do
And give me what you'd give me
If I were you
'Cause what you give is what you get

So if you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby

If you plant the seeds of wildflower
Don't expect to tame a mild flower
If you plan to cheat and keep on lying
Don't expect for me to sit home crying
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby
Gimme what you want, what you want, baby...
