// Blues Ain't Nothin' //

Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Honey she can't love him when she wanna
She go to love him when he can

Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
You got to grab man when you can baby
And love him when you will

She might be down in the church house kneelin' down to pray
Down in the church house kneelin' down to pray
She been lovin' that man
Drove her heart insane

Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lovin' a married man
Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lovin' a married man
Honey she can't get him when she want him
She got to love him when he can

She left him walkin fast - cryin didn't have nuthin to say
Walkin' fast - didn't have nuthin to say
You know the woman be here in the morning
Oh she won't be back today

I'm gonna sing it new time for muddy water, singin deep down in the blue
Sing it for muddy water, singin deep down in the blue
Oh muddy did 'em first
Honey now I'm gonna do 'em too

My horse gone lame, believe you done gone blind
My horse gone lame, believe you done gone blind
I wouldn't be here in the mornin baby
Might get back in a coupla days time

// Hard Way //

Well, I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go
I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go

I've been down and out
When the ground was covered with snow

I used to get so worried
I could cry the whole night through
Yeah, all know I'd get so worried
I would cry the whole night through

Think about my troubles
And the hardships I've been through, yeah

Someday I may get lucky
And find me a place to go
You know someday I may get lucky
And find me a place to go

I've tried and tried
It's been a hard, hard way to go

Well, I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go
You all know I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go

I've been down and out
When the ground was covered with snow
Yes, I have

// Strut //

You should have never said you loved me as you laid across my folding bed
You should have never said you loved me as you laid across my folding bed
Drinkin' your white lightning, baby, talkin' all out of your head

You said, "Baby, baby, baby... buh-buh-baby, baby that's all right with me"
You said, "Duh-duh-dad, daddy, daddy... daddy that's all right with me"
You can have my juicy lovin' but don't you throw it in the deep blue sea
...

// Going To The River //

I'm going to the river
Gonna go overboard and drown
I'm going to the river
Gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the gal I love
She just have left this town

When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I would be
I would be the one to cry

Well, if you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
If you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
I'm tired of living
Living in misery

// Blue Light Boogie //

They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I went to a party, was nothin' there but bobby socks
Went to a party, man you oughta seen 'em to reel and rock

They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I started rockin', man I threw my left foot out
I started swingin', somebody begin to shout

You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

The girls boys, they made so much noise
They even had a raid
But when the police got there all they could find
Was ice cream and lemonade
Oh, what a party
I'm so glad I didn't stay at home
Oh, what a party

They didn't treat me like I was a chaperone
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

The women had they're heads laid on their fellas' shoulders
Who were boogie-woogeyin' and squeezin' em up in the room
I couldn't see how they was dancin
Cuz their feet, they didn't move

// The Hoochi Coochi Coo //

She's doing the hoochi coochi coo
They're swirling in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo

Hey, mama, you better come real quick
Tell papa to bring a hickory stick
She's shaking like she's breaking
And I know she'll soon be aching
From doing the hoochi coochi coo

She's spinning like a top
Shimmying with that steady rock
Dipping up and down
Then she go, round
Round and round

Hey, mama, what you you gonna do

Hey, mama, just look at little Sue
They're swishing in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo

Spinning like a top
Shimmying with that steady rock
Dipping up and down
Then she go, round
Round and round

Hey, mama, what you you gonna do
Hey, mama, look at little Sue
They're swishing in the kitchen
I know she'll get a licking
For doing the hoochi coochi coo

// That's How Strong My Love Is //

If I were the sun way up there
I'd go with love almost anywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down
Just to let you know I'm still around
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tear
You can go swimming when you are here
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm

That's how strong my love is, darling
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

I'll be the ocean so deep, deep and wide
Catch the tears whenever you cry
I'll be the breeze after the storm has gone
To dry your eyes and love you warm

That's how strong my love is

That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is, baby
That's how strong my love is

That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
So much of loving, so much
So much, so much of loving

That's how strong my love is, c'mon
That's how strong my love is, be young
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is

// Down Home Girl //

Lord, I swear the perfume you wear
Was made out of turnip greens
And every time I kiss you girl
It tastes like pork and beans

Even though you're wearin' them
Citified high heels
I can tell by your giant step
You been walkin' through the cotton fields

Oh, you're so down home girl

Every time you monkey child
You take my breath away
And every time you move like that
I gotta get down and pray

Don't you know that dress of yours
Was made out of fiberglass
And every time you move like that
I gotta go to Sunday mass

Oh, you're so down home girl
Oh, you're so down home girl

I'm gonna take you to the muddy river
And push you in
Just to watch the water roll on
Down your velvet skin

I'm gonna take you back to New Orleans
Down in Dixieland
I'm gonna watch you do the second line
With a umbrella in your hand

Oh, you're so down home girl

I'm with you baby
You're so down home
Ow! Yeah, too much
Outta sight
You're so down home girl

// Stranger In My Own Home Town //

I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town

My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down
Oh no, can't get him down

I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago

But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more

My home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more

I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
Yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down

I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down

I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh, but you can't keep a good man down

// Sitting On Top Of The World //

I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blonde-headed woman, she's the cause of it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Saw her in Dallas, in El Paso
So come back baby, I need you so
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

I worked all summer, spring and fall
Blonde-headed woman was the cause of it all
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Don't come here running, holding out your hand
I have me a woman, you can grab your man
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Saw her in Dallas, in El Paso
Blonde-headed woman, you know I need you so
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Don't come here running, holding out your hand
I have me a woman, you can have your man
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

Mississippi river, so big and wide
Blonde-headed woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

// I Can't Help Myself (Sugarpie Honeybunch) //

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go, go, go
Leavin' just your picture behind, baby
I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers and wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron string, baby
And there's nothing that I can't do

Sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see

Tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
Honey I'm not tryin', I've tried
But every time I see your face, baby
Oh, I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burnin' in my heart, tearin' me apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

Sugarpie honeybunch
[?] I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugarpie honeybunch
Honey, I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else, baby
