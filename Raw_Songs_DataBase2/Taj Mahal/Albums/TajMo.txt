// Don't Leave Me Here //

How the weather in the country?
How the weather down south?
How the weather in the Delta?
How the food taste in your mouth?
Butter beans and cornbread, grits and greens
Candied yams and black eyed peas

If you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Ooh, y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

When you see Ludella, tell her hey for me
Last time I saw her, it was in my dreams
She's the sweetest thing under the sun
When I think about some lovin', she's still the one

Now if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Well you know, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

What they doin' in Vicksburg down in Aberdeen?
They got more fine big-legged women
Than any one man ever seen
What they doin' in Jackson and little old Itta Bena?
I ain't been to Clarksdale since 1963

'Cause if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

How the weather in the Delta?
Sure cold up here
Baby run off and left me late last year
It was just before Christmas
Deep, deep snow on the ground
Came home later in the evening
She done tore my playhouse down

So if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Ooh, y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

Don't leave
Please don't leave me here, mmm
Please don't leave, ooh
Please don't leave me here

Ooh, well I'll be
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me here

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave

// She Knows How To Rock Me //

I'm goin' downtown
Get me a rockin' chair
Gon' let my baby rock me
On away from here
But she knows how to rock me (know how to rock me)
Lord, she sure can rock me (she sure know how rock me)
If ya ever been rocked
Then you know just what I mean (know just what I mean, come on!)

Yeah, she can rock me up
She rock me, down
Rock me, cross

// All Around The World //

What's all the fuss about?
Why can't people just get along?
Maybe we oughta talk about
All the good we got goin' on
Everybody knows there's a better way
Everyone hopin' and prayin' that one day

There'll be love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)

Can't you just feel it everywhere
It's a powerful spirit up in the air
Won't be no reason to sing the blues
And there won't be nothin' on the radio
But some good news

There'll be love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)

You know we're gonna bring about
A positive change
I can't help thinkin' about
How it keeps on gettin' so strange
How do we get away
From the misery and pain
And still feel the sunshine
In the pourin' rain?

And have love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)
Yeah, there gonna be some love
Yeah, love (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)
All around the
There'll be peace and understanding (There'll be dancin')
There'll be joy all around the world
Happy children singin'
Around the world

// Om Sweet Om //

There's a big 'ol sound coming from the sky
Something that you can't really analyze
Like a big ol circle around the sun
There's a little 'old circle 'round everyone
Way down in the jungle, between the trees
Deep in the desert, under the sea
The wind and the rain make a sacred sound
It's way out in the country, it's in the middle of town

Om, sweet home
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on!

Wait a minute, let's go outside
Open up your heart and let's pray a while
Hear the world all around you, let it all in
There ain't no beginning and there ain't no end

Om, sweet home (sweet)
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on!

There's a big ol' sound coming from the sky
Something that you can't really analyze
When the sun goes down from dusk to dawn
And he don't really care who it shines upon

Om, sweet home (sweet)
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on (don't you know I'm saying)
Om, sweet home
Om, right on (right on)
Om, sweet home, right on, right on, right on (sweet home, right on, oh yeah, right on, right on)

// That's Who I Am //

I'm a preacher, I'm a sinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I got everything, I got nothing
But I'm a fool for some real good loving
I was looking for myself when I found you
And your love was all around
Now I can't see my life without you
Oh, that's who I am
That's who I am
Right now

I'm a lover, I'm a fighter
I'm a reader, and I'm a writer
I got a ball, and I got a chain
But I'm free of misery and pain
I was looking for myself when I found you
And your love was all around
Now I can't see my life without you
That's who I am
That's who I am

I'm ready to surrender
To you and I together, babe
The way your love has changed me
Will stay with me forever

And I was looking for myself when I found you
Your love's all around
Now I can't see my life without you
And that's who I am
That's who I am
Yeah, that's who I am
That's who I am
Oh yeah, that's who I am, yeah baby
That's who I am
Right now

Got to play it for the Reverend Charles Cobb
Dean Carpenter
Rev Porter on it
Hawkins, Higginbotham
Mister Cole
Yeah, I missed my step
Yeah, Adele Pickens
Mister Dean
Sister Davis

// Squeeze Box //

Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

Well, the kids don't eat
And the dog don't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy never sleeps at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in and out
She's going in and out and in and out

Cause' she's playing all night
And the music's all tight
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
You know, Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy don't sleep at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in
In and out and in and out, in and out and in
She goes in and out and in and out, in and out and in

// Waiting On The World To Change //

Me and my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to be persistent
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would've never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
Oh, they can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
Not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change

And we're still waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
Keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
One day, the younger generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting, yeah
Waiting on the world to change
(Keep on waiting) yeah
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
