// Never Let You Go //

Like the stars in the Hawaiian sky
Sweet honey, you know you shine
There's none brighter, baby, in my eyes
I'm so happy that you're mine, all mine

Your smile is my sunny day
Chasing all my many troubles away
The way you kiss so tenderly
Don't you know you make my life complete?

And when I'm far away
In some old distant land
I know I can hold on
'Cause it won't be too long
Till I'm back in your arms

And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna love you right
I'll never let you go

Sugar, when I'm on my fishing boat
You're the star that leads me safely home
Other honey just don't taste as sweet
You're my one and only queen bee

'Cause your smile is my sunny day
Chasing my many troubles away
Baby, with you standing by my side
I'm gonna be happy till the end of time

It only takes one glance
Into those pretty eyes
I know I can walk the line
You and me, we'll be just fine
With your hand in mine

And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, ooh , baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna love you right
I'll never let you go
Ooh, and, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go

// Further On Down The Road //

Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days
Just the warm warm fun
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be
I'll be glad to learn from you
And I know you will be glad to learn from me

If we get down, if we get sad
We can cheer up each other cuz things just ain't so bad
If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be

Day by day, baby, just one step at a time
Cuz woman, you have given me so much
Just to ease this stubborn little achin' heart of mine

I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they might say
Woman, you've been lovin' in my corner
All... all the way, baby

Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days
Just the warm warm fun

Honey, you will accompany me...

// TV Mama //

I was in my bed a'sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was in my bed sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was dreamin' 'bout my TV Mama, the one with the big, wide screen

She got great big eyes and little bitty feet
And in the waist, she's so nice and neat
She's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, man, she makes me scream

She just taste like candy, boys, I really go for sweets
I love her from her head down to her little bitty feet
Yeah, she's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, oh yes, I'm bound to scream

I'm just kind-a rollin', tumblin', talkin' all out of my head
Well just I'm rollin' and tumblin', man, I'm talkin' all out of my head
And when my baby shook me, man, I fell right out of bed

// Slow Drag //

Said I'm tired a little, and doing my time
The judge said, Son, I give you one to 99
I give you one, give you 99
Give you one, give you 99
You know you doing time partner, cause you have done the crime

Said I'm tired of living, in this low-down prison cell
And I wouldn't have been here darling, hadn't been for Big-Legged Nel
I wouldn't have been in the hoosegow, that jailhouse, cause of Big-Legged Nel
I wouldn't have been in the jailhouse, cause it was Big-Legged Nel
She said she was from New Orleans, needed protection, cause she had something to sell

If I ever get out of this prison, I'm going to do just like I please
I'm gonna take off straight running, to the nearest bunch of trees
Baby I'm gonna be run, run, run, run, run, run, run, running to the nearest bunch of trees
I'm gonna be running, running, run, running to the nearest bunch of trees
I'm going to be running so fast, pretty baby, looks like man'll be running on his knees

Said I'm tired of living, and doing my time
The judge said, Son, give you one to 99
If I don't get no loving in the morning, before I come to chambers, give you 99
If I don't get no corn liquor before chambers in the morning, I'm gonna give you 99
You know you doing time partner, because you have done the crime

// Hello Josephine //

Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me baby?
Like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler
Woo, woo, woo

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella
Every time it rained
You used to cry so much
It was a cryin' shame

You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk
I used to tote you on my back
Now you try to make believe
It was a thrill at that

Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me baby?
Like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler
Woo, woo, woo
