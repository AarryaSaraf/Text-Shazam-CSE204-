// Oh, Susannah //

It rained so hard the day I left
The weather it was dry, sun so hot
I'd like to froze myself to death
Susanna don't you cry
Singin' oh, Susanna don't you, don't you
Don't you cry 'bout me
'Cause I, 'cause I'm on my way to Alabama, baby
With your banjo upon my knee

Well now it rained so hard the day I left
The weather it was dry, don't you know that
I would like to froze myself to death
Susanna don't you cry

Singin' oh, Susanna
Baby, don't you cry 'bout me
'Cause I ,'cause I'm on my way to Alabama
Baby, with that banjo upon my knee

Come along, baby true love, baby
Honey, make me strong
Oh, woman when I'm standing near you, baby
You make me feel ten feet tall

Singin' singin' oh, Susanna
Baby, don't you cry 'bout me
'Cause I'm on my way to Alabama
Baby with your banjo upon my knee

Well I come from Alabama
My true love for to see
I'm goin' down Louisiana
Baby, don't you cry about me

Singin' oh, Susanna
Baby, don't you cry 'bout me
'Cause I'm on my way to Alabama
With the banjo upon my knee

Oh, give it up, give it up
Give it up, give it up, oh
Talkin' 'bout, oh Alabama
With the banjo upon my knee

Honey, oh, on my knee, baby
Oh, woman on my knee
Said but don't you understand?
It's on my knees

// Tomorrow May Not Be Your Day //

Hey if it's love you want

Baby don't you wait too long
Oh, mama don't you wait too long
Oh, honey don't you wait too long
Cause tomorrow may not be your day

You know we all have our sad times
And then again we all have our glad times
But everybody in the whole damn world
Need a friend
