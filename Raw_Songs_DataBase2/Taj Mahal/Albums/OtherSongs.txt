// Chainey Do //

I went down town the other night
Nobody will love you
Everything... and none ain't right
Nobody will love you you
Nobody will love you child
Nobody will love you true, true, true!
Nobody will love you baby
Nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do

Went down town with my head...
Nobody will love you
Looking for a woman, don't need no man
Nobody will love you you
Nobody will love you child
Nobody will love you true, true, true!
Nobody will love you baby
Nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do

I love my pop and I love my baby...
I love my biscuits...
Somebody will love you you
Somebody will love you you, child
Somebody will love you you,true, true!
Somebody will love you you, baby
Though nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
Get it, baby?

Went downtown to love, man
Nobody will love me!
Everything wrong and none ain't right
Nobody will love you you
Nobody will love you child
Nobody will love you true, true, true!
Nobody will love you baby
Nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
No, nobody will love you like a Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
Chainey, Chainey Do
