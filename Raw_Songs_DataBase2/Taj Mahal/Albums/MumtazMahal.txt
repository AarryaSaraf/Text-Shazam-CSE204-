// Johnny Too Bad //

Walking down the road with a pistol in your waist
Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road with a ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbin' now you're stabbin'
Now you're lootin' now you're shootin'
Boy too bad
You're just robbin' and you're stabbin'
Now you're lootin' now you're shootin'
Boy too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to?
One of these days when you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to?

You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There'll be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock for rescue
There'll be no rock

[?]
Johnny you're too bad...
