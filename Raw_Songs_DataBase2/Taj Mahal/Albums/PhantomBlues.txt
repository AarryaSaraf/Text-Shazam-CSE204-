// Lovin' In My Baby's Eyes //

Look here baby now you know I can
Be the one to be your man
Baby now you know I knew I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Oh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
See that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Look here baby now you know darn well
Love you better than another man could tell
Love you baby
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
I say lovin' in my baby's eyes
I say lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold your pictures to my breast
Love you baby
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
You see the lovin' in my baby's eyes
Have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Love ya baby
Love ya baby
Mama now you know I do
Love ya baby
Love ya baby
Do anything for you

I said, late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold you pictures to my breast
Love you Mama
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Oh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me that magic in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

// Cheatin' On You //

It's the end to all my high jinx
It's the end to all my capers
Sort of a three way story
(The kind you read about in the Sunday papers)

All I was gettin' over
Havin' both cakes and eatin' them too
But to my surprise
My slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you
Been cheatin' on you with
Somebody's been cheatin' on me

Thought I was a Jimmy Slick
(Yeah, I thought that)
Don't I was a Charlie Cool
(Thought that too)
But I'm just sad and stupid
(My friends call me Freddy Poo)

Ooh dooped, why don't you call me
Turn the dooper into the doop
I'm so surprised
To find my slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you... baby
I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with
Somebody's been cheatin' on me
(Oh, somebody say something)

(Oh yeah)
(Slow that guitar)

How co-co-co-co-coo ooh dooped
Why don't you call me
Turn the dooper into the doop
I'm so surprised
To find my slice on the sun
Been eatin' the forbidden fruit

Oh, I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with somebody's been cheatin' on me

Baby, baby, babe
Cheatin' on you... ah ah ah
Cheatin' on you
I've been cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me

Yeah baby
Cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me
Come, come, come, come, come on
Cheatin' on you with somebody's
Been cheatin' on me

// Here In The Dark //

Well, I'm here in the dark
And I can't see the light of day
Yes, I'm here in the dark
And I can't see the light of day
[?]

Well, I'm here in the dark
And I'm feeling so very blue
Yes, I'm here in the dark
And I'm feeling so very blue
Oh yes, its cold outside
And the rain is falling too

Well, I'm here in the night
And in my heart I feel so sad
Yes, I'm here in the night
And in my heart I feel so sad
I've lost my only love
Oh, the blues I've got them bad

// I Need Your Loving //

I need your love every day
I need it every hour
Come on and set my little soul on fire
I say I need love, love, love, love
Need your lovin', babe, I need it every day
Come on and give it to me every hour
I want you to set my little soul on fire
Say I need love, love, love, love

I need your lovin', baby
Hear what I say, need it every day
Need it every hour
Set my little soul on fire

Now everybody needs somebody sometime

Need it every day, I wanna say it to you
Just a little bit louder
Tell you just hear what I say
I say, I need love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby

// Lonely Avenue //

Well, my room has got two windows
The sunlight never comes through
I'm so sad and lonely, baby
Since I broke off baby with you

I live on a lonely avenue
Little girl, since you said you're through
Now I feel so sad and blue
It's all because of you
I could die, I could die, I could die
I could die, I could die, I could die
I live on a lonely avenue

My pillow is made of lead
And my cover is made of stone
I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to living alone

I live on a lonely avenue
Girl, since you said we're through
And I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you
I could die, I could die, I could die
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry
I live on a lonely avenue
A lonely avenue

// Don't Tell Me //

Girl, where'd you get that frown?
Don't tell me baby
And who would let you down?
Don't tell me baby, come on now

We've been talkin' bout
The same old things like whether
We'd be worrying about
It if we were together, yeah

And who woulda broke your heart?
Don't tell me, baby
About well my favorite part
Don't tell me baby, child

In the time it takes for you to think it over, yeah
I'll be closer than the seat belt on your shoulder
So, won't you come on over, girl?

I'm a repo man, it's sad but I'll have to do
You know I know girl, you can't keep me guessing
It's the same old plan but your name's been engraved in blue
You know my way girl, I've learned my lesson

Girl, I can see you cry
Don't tell me baby
And girl, if you must confide
Don't tell me baby, closer

In the time it takes for you to think it over
I'll be closer than the sequins on your shoulder
But won't you think it over, girl

Don't tell me baby
Don't tell me baby
Don't tell me baby, girl

// What Am I Living For? //

What am I living for if not for you?
What am I living for if not for you?
What am I living for if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do

What am I longing for each lonely night?
To feel your lips to mine, to hold you tight
You'll be the only girl my whole life through
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do

I want you close to me that's all I know
I want you all the time because darling I love you so

Tell me what am I living for if not for you, baby?
What am I living for darling, if not for you?
What am I living for if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do, ooh

What am I living for if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do
Oh, sugar baby, nobody else, nobody else will do

// We're Gonna Make It //

We may not have a cent to pay the rent
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to eat beans everyday
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand in the welfare line
I've got your love and you know you got mine
And we're gonna make it

We may not have a home to call our own
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
We're gonna make it, I know we will
'Cause togetherness brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love and you know you've got mine
And we're gonna make it

The car may be old our two rooms cold
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
And though we can't spare a roach a crumb
But we're gonna make it, I know
And if I have to carry around a sign
That says, "help the deaf, the dumb and the blind"
I've got your love and you know you've got mine
We're gonna make it, I know we will

We're gonna make it...

// Let The Four Winds Blow //

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to you
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand

I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to you
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

// (You've Got To) Love Her With A Feeling //

Now-ow, if you wanna love that woman
A-you love her with a thrill
'Cause-a if you don't
A-some other man will

You've got to love her with a feeling
You got to love her with a feeling
Love her with a feeling, man
Or don't you love at all

She shakes all over
A-when she walks
She made a blind man see
She made a, a dumb man talk

You know she love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all

The cops took her in
How that woman didn't need no bail
How she wiggled one time for the judge
And the judge put the cops in jail

You know you love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all
