// You're Gonna Need Somebody On Your Bond //

You're gonna need somebody on your bond, child
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
When it's late 'round midnight and old man
Death comes slippin' into the room
You're gonna need somebody on your bond

You take Mary and Martha standin' up in the hillside
Mary explainin' to Martha, "Darlin', look at the river deep and the water wide"
Here comes ole Moses, faithful Moses carryin' big ole stones up the hill
Tellin' everybody they're gonna need somebody on their bond

Whoa, you take Mavis Staples and ole Corn Cheevers [?]
They got the good side on their bond
Oh, I been listen to the music people ever since the day I was born
My momma raised me in a room across from the church by the tree

And that sweet gospel music, oh how it used to comfort me
Tellin' everybody they're gonna need somebody on their bond

// Six Days On The Road //

I pulled out of Pittsburgh an I rolling down the eastern seaboard
I've got my diesel wound up and she's running like she never did before
There's a speed zone ahead all right, I don't see a cop in sight
Six days upon the road and I gotta see my baby tonight

I got ten forward gears and a sweet Georgia overdrive
I'm taking little white pills and my eyes are open wide
Just passed a Jimmy and a White, I've been passing everything in sight
Six days upon the road and I gotta see my baby tonight

It seems like a month since I kissed my baby bye bye
I got a lot of woman but I'm not like some of the guys
Got my air horns running clear, baby, you oughta watch the way I shift my gears
Six days upon the road and I gotta see my baby tonight

ICC is checking on down the line
Honey you know I'm a little overweight and my log books way behind
But nothing bothers a soul at night, I can dodge them scales all right
Six days upon the road and I gotta see my baby tonight

My rigs a little old but it don't mean she's slow
There's a good flame coming from her smokestack and the smoke's black as coal
My home town coming in sight, if you think I'm happy, baby baby baby your right
Six days upon the road and I gotta see my baby tonight

// Wild Ox Moan //

Won't you come here, good woman
And listen to the wild ox moan?
Now won't you come here, good woman
And sit down on you [?]

I got something to tell you, good woman
Something to tell you, good woman
Well, well, can you come in my heart?

So woman, you come here, good woman
And hear this wild ox moan
Now won't you come here, good woman?
And hear this wild ox moan

// Cluck Old Hen //

I got me a rooster and I put him in the barn
He stayed there and kept them old hens warm

Cluck old hen
Cluck all day
Cluck old hen
Cluck all day

I brought them eggs in to the house
Mama said they sure look fine
Cooked 'em inside and we had enough to eat
These eggs come from those hens of mine

Cluck old hen
Cluck all day
Cluck old hen
Cluck all day

// Annie's Lover //

Annie's lover was a big old man, he was a farming man
Never spent much time worrying 'bout the peoples
In the big, big city

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats
And the ducks that fly
Sat on the hillside playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony

Well, Annie's lover was a big ol' man, he was a African man
He walked around and looked and saw and saw everything
That his eyes could see

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats and the trees
And the water and the fields and the mountains
And the blue skies and the big clouds and the ducks they fly
He sat on the hillside, playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony

Oh, Annie's lover was a big old man, he was a farming man
Never spent much time worry 'bout the peoples
In the big, big, big city

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats
And the big, big mountains and the blue skies and the water
And the big trees and the grass and the ducks they fly
He sat on the hillside, playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony
