// Shake That Thing //

Down in Georgia, got a dance that's new
Ain't nothin' to it, it's easy to do
Called "Shake That Thing"
Oh, shake that thing!
I'm gettin' sick and tired of telling you to shake that thing!

Now, the old folks start doin' it, the young folks, too
But the old folks learn the young ones what to do
About shakin' that thing
Ah, shake that thing!
I'm gettin' sick and tired of telling you to shake that thing!

Now, Grandpapa Johnson grabbed Sister Kate
He shook her like you shake jelly on a plate
How he shook that thing
Oh, he shook that thing!
I'm gettin' sick and tired of telling you to shake that thing!

Why, there's old Uncle Jack, the jellyroll king
He's got a hump in his back from shakin' that thing
Yet, he still shakes that thing
For an old man, how he can shake that thing!
And he never gets tired of tellin' young folks: go out and shake that thing!

Now, it ain't no Charleston, ain't no Pigeon Wing
Nobody has to give you no lessons, to shake that thing
When everybody can shake that thing
Oh, I mean, shake that thing!
I'm gettin' tired of telling you how to shake that thing!
Ooh, ooh, with this kind of music, who wouldn't shake that thing?
