// Good Morning Miss Brown //

Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
I said good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
She say I'm feelin' fine and lookin' good
Man what about you?

I say I got the misery and the back ache baby
And my feet's hurtin' me when I walk
You know I got the misery and the back ache baby
And my feet's hurtin' me when I walk
And you know too much conversation hurt my tongue to talk

I laid down last night
I tried to take my night's rest
Oh baby you know, I laid down last night
I tried to take my natural rest
You know my heart start a wandering
Just like the wild geese in the west

The blues jumped a rabbit
Rabbit run a quarter mile
Yes the blues jumped up a rabbit
Rabbit run for a quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter mile
You know that poor little furry bunny
Scared just like a baby child
And if you ain't scared
Man you ain't right!

Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
Well she say I'm doin' fine daddy tell me
Man, how 'bout you?

// I Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Steal My Jellyroll //

Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
You know I'm doin' some good lovin' on a woman
She keep me satisfied deep down in my soul

I'm goin' to take you back down on the Delta peoples
Where ya, you'll hear about Hi Henry Brown - now that was a man
I'm goin' to take you back down on the Delta, baby
Back to the days of Hi Henry Brown
When he begin to play his guitar
You know all the women would let their skirts go hang on down

I'm in love with you baby
You know you're the finest woman, the finest woman here in the town
Yes, I'm in love with you baby
'Cause you're the finest woman, the finest woman here in the town
Ooh, baby now you put love solid, woman, so it will not come down

Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll, they can't, they can't
'Cause you know I'm lovin' on a woman
And she make me feel down, feel good down in my very soul

Now watch me call my baby

Wooh
Wooh
Wooh, baby
Wooh, mama
Wooh, wooh

// Going Up To The Country, Paint My Mailbox Blue //

Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Gonna move up to the country

Paint some trailin' vines and dew

You know I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog's got me down
I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog has got me down
I'm goin' up to the canyon
Where there ain't nobody else around

Come here baby
Mama, let me take you, take you by yo' hand
Come here baby

You be my woman
And I will be your city-boy, country man

Gonna paint, gonna paint, gonna paint, my mailbox blue
Move up to the country
Gonna paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it honey
Paint some trailin' vines and dew

// She Caught The Katy And Left Me A Mule To Ride //

She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
Well, my baby caught the Katy
She left me a mule to ride
The train pulled out and I swung on behind
I'm crazy 'bout her
That hard-headed woman of mine

Man, my baby long
Great, God, she mighty, she tall
You know my baby long
Great God, she mighty, my baby tall
Well, you know my baby, she long
My baby, she tall
She sleep with her head in the kitchen
And her big feet's out in the hall
And I'm still crazy about her
That hard-headed woman of mine

I love my baby
She's so fine
I wish she'd come to save me sometime
'Cause she don't believe I love her
Look what a hole I'm in
And she don't believe I'm singin'
What look what a shape I'm in

She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
Well, my baby caught the Katy
Left me a mule to ride
The train pulled out and I swung on behind
Well, I'm crazy 'bout her
That hard-headed woman
Hard-headed woman of mine

// The Cuckoo //

You know the cuckoo
She's a pretty bird
Baby but she warble woman as she fly
But she never, never heard a cuckoo
Until the Fourth Day of July

Mama, mama
Ooh, sweet mama
Tell you boy not to be a gamblin' man
Cuz the card'll cheat em'
Lord they will beat him
And they'll leave him with a losin' hand

Jack o' Diamonds
Yeah, Jack o' Diamonds
Well, ya robbed my poor pocket o' silver and gold
First ya hurt me
Then ya desert me
Then ya leave me out in the cold

I'm gonna buy me
Baby, I'm gonna buy me
A little cabin on the mountain top
You know I'm gonna stay there
Baby I'm just gonna lay there
I don't care if the whole world come to a stop

You know the cuckoo is a pretty bird
Baby but she warble as she fly
But baby you never heard a cuckoo
Until the Fourth of July

// You Don't Miss Your Water ('Til Your Well Runs Dry) //

In the beginning, baby, you really loved me
But I was too blind to really see
But now you left me, oh, how I cried
You don't miss your water, babe
Woman, 'til your well, 'til your well runs dry

I kept you crying, darling, so sad and blue
You knew all the time I was a playboy
And I just would not be true
But when you left me, baby, and it was the way you said goodbye
And I miss my water, I miss my water, I miss my water, baby
And you know my well ran dry

I sit and wonder, woman, how can this be?
You know I never thought you'd ever
Baby, you would ever leave me
But now you left me, woman, oh, how I've cried
You don't miss your water, don't miss your water, baby
Woman, 'til your well, 'til your well runs dry
You don't miss your water, baby, 'til your well runs dry

You don't miss your water, baby
No, no, no, no, you don't miss your water, baby
Mama, you just don't miss your water
Oh baby, you just don't miss your water
Woman, you just don't miss your water
Oh and you know you just don't miss your water

You just, you just don't miss your water, you just don't miss your water
No, no, you just don't miss your water, baby
How can I tell you?
How can I tell you?
You just don't miss your water, babe
You just don't, you just don't miss your water, baby
'Til your well, 'til your well runs dry

// Ain't That A Lot Of Love //

You gotta dig it, baby

Yes, yes, yes know the deserts couldn't hold all the love that I have in my heart for you
If I could spread it out across the sea you know my love would cover it all up
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Now if the cooks in the kitchen had a dress as tight yours, they wouldn't need a fire
Ain't a word I could say just describe your fine looks and loving desire
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Baby, you got a smile, so rare
You got a kiss, so good
You got a hug, so nice
Whole lot of loving, baby, baby
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Now if the bees only knew how sweet your love was, they'd pack up their honey comb
If the birds ever heared how sweet your voice was, they'd pack up their song, yeah
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

Baby, ain't that kindness
Baby, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness
Got to tell you that's all kindness
We got to get it together now
We got to get it all together
Baby, ain't that a whole lot of loving
Woman, ain't that a whole lot of loving
Baby, ain't that a loving
Baby, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness
Woman, ain't that a kindness
Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody please
Somebody, somebody tell me
Somebody, somebody please
Somebody, somebody somewhere
Somebody, somebody tell me
We got to have a lot of loving

Know the desert couldn't hold all the love that I have in my heart for you
If I could spread it out across the sea I know my love would cover it all up
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold
Ain't that a lot of love for two hearts to have and hold

// New Stranger Blues //

Ooh, I'm a stranger
But baby, I dig your warm
Your warm and tender love
Ooh, I'm a stranger, baby
But you know I dig you warm and tender love
Now I know what was goin' down
In other peace the wiseman spoke of

Have you ever been on the outside, baby
And you knew that you could not understand
Have you ever been on the outside, baby
Balled down and you could not understand
Well, its like wakin' up form a bad nights sleep
And findin' that the blues just left you cold, cold at hand

Well, I've frowned on my baby
Baby, do you see she says
Its Pegasus and Leo
Smilin' down at the sky beam
Tell me, darlin'
Ooh, can it be
Oh, is how nice it can be

Ooh, I'm a stranger here
Baby, lost in your warm and tender love
Ooh, I'm a stranger here
And I've digged in lost in your warm and tender love
You know I know so well now
What all those old town wiseman talked of

Oh, oh, oh, baby
I'm gonna treat you good
Ooh baby, and treat myself as well
Ooh, yeah
