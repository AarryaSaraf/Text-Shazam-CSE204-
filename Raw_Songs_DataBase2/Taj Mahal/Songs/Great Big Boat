Me and my baby and that great big boat
Gonna sail down the coast of Mexico
Take a slow ride through the Panama Canal
Come out in the Caribbean

Sun may shine and that wind may blow
Sails billowing as we go
Rolling down over the waves
Come out in the Caribbean

I love you baby, you know I do
Anything in the world for you
Sailing at night amongst the stars
Come out in the Caribbean...

The wind will blow
Down the coast of Mexico
Gulf of Tehuanapequa
Come out in the Caribbean

I love my baby, you know I do
Anything in the world for you

Come out in the Caribbean

Me and my baby and that great big boat
Gonna sail down the coast of Mexico
Take a slow ride through the Panama Canal
Come out in the Caribbean...
