Ooh, I'm a stranger
But baby, I dig your warm
Your warm and tender love
Ooh, I'm a stranger, baby
But you know I dig you warm and tender love
Now I know what was goin' down
In other peace the wiseman spoke of

Have you ever been on the outside, baby
And you knew that you could not understand
Have you ever been on the outside, baby
Balled down and you could not understand
Well, its like wakin' up form a bad nights sleep
And findin' that the blues just left you cold, cold at hand

Well, I've frowned on my baby
Baby, do you see she says
Its Pegasus and Leo
Smilin' down at the sky beam
Tell me, darlin'
Ooh, can it be
Oh, is how nice it can be

Ooh, I'm a stranger here
Baby, lost in your warm and tender love
Ooh, I'm a stranger here
And I've digged in lost in your warm and tender love
You know I know so well now
What all those old town wiseman talked of

Oh, oh, oh, baby
I'm gonna treat you good
Ooh baby, and treat myself as well
Ooh, yeah
