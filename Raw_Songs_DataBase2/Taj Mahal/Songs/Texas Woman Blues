Far below the northern lights
Far below the northern lights
Far below the northern lights

Oh, I wish I was in Texas
Movin' on a steady roll
I wish I was in Texas
Movin' on a steady roll
You know I love that fine lookin'
Texas woman to satisfy my soul

You know, my baby is sweet as honey
Sweet from the honey bee
You know, my baby is sweet as honey
Sweet from the honey bee
Ain't nothin' else to sing of in my life
Ooh, she'd be so nice to me

Lord, it ain't no use to worry
Ain't no use to mourn
Lord, ain't no use to worry
Ain't no use to mourn
You know the way I love that woman
I just can't stand to leave alone

Jives on this song

Got love for ten women
But the one woman on my mind
She don't treat me like no stranger
She treat me nice and kind

She don't worry about the neighbors
'Cause they might not like what they see
She could care less about what they sayin'
She's a woman and she's absolutely free

I wish I was down there in Texas
Swingin' on a steady roll
I'd love that San Antonio woman
To satisfy my soul

I'd love that San Antonio woman
To satisfy my soul

I'd love that fine, fine Texas woman
To satisfy my soul
