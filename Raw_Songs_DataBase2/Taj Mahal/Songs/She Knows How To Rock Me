I'm goin' downtown
Get me a rockin' chair
Gon' let my baby rock me
On away from here
But she knows how to rock me (know how to rock me)
Lord, she sure can rock me (she sure know how rock me)
If ya ever been rocked
Then you know just what I mean (know just what I mean, come on!)

Yeah, she can rock me up
She rock me, down
Rock me, cross
Lord, she rocks me 'round
She knows how to rock me (she knows how to rock me)
She sure can rock me (she sure know how to rock me)
If you ever been rocked
Then you know just what I mean, lets rock!

Now, she rocks me in
She rocks me out
She knows what it's all about
She sure can rock me (she sure know how to rock)
Ooh, rock me (oh, she knows)
If you ever been rocked
You know just what I mean (you know just what I mean)
Rock with me, now

(Well...
Yeah, she know, oh, beautiful love
What you got?)

She rocks me to the right
She rocks me to the left
Sometime, I believe
She gon' rock me to death
She knows how to rock me (she knows how to rock me)
Oh, rock me
If you ever been rocked
You know just what I mean (you know just what I mean)
Oh Lord, Lord!

(Oh, right...)

But now my girl
Is gettin' mighty funny
Don't wanna rock
Unless I give her my money
But she sho' can rock me (oh, she know how to rock me)
Knows how to rock me (you should take this money to 'er)
Now, if you ever been rocked
You'll know just what I mean (yeah yeah, you know what I mean)
(If you ever been rocked) now, if you ever been rocked
You'll know just what I mean
