I really can't stay (But baby it's cold outside)
I've got to away (But baby it's cold outside)
This evening has been (So happy that you'd dropped in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)
Well maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (But baby it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
I seem to be in (Your eyes are like starlit sin)
Some crazy spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say "No, no, no sir" (Ya mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Baby make my conscious your guide)

I really can't stay (Oh, baby don't hold out)
Ah but it's cold outside

I simply must go (But baby it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But baby it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (So lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just tiny talk more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But baby you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a comb (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died)

I really can't stay (Get over that old doubt)
Ah but it's cold outside
