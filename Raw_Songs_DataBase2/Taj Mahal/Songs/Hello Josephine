Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me baby?
Like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler
Woo, woo, woo

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella
Every time it rained
You used to cry so much
It was a cryin' shame

You used to live over yonder
By the railroad track
When it rained you couldn't walk
I used to tote you on my back
Now you try to make believe
It was a thrill at that

Hello Josephine, how do you do?
Do you remember me baby?
Like I remember you
You used to laugh at me and holler
Woo, woo, woo
