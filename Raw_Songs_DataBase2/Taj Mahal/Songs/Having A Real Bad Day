I found her number, and the note she wrote
Deep in the pocket, of a real old coat
It just got by me some way

I'm having a real bad day
Said she was all moved in and her apartment, sure looked fine
Suggested I come by, and see her some time

Said all her fixtures were new, and I'll turn them on for you
She said I get home at a quarter to six
I'll be waiting for your call
I'll fix you something, I'm sure your gonna love

But we don't have to, we don't have to eat at all
That's one of the problems, of life on the road
Little notes like this ain't got no area code
I don't know what else to say

I'm having, a real bad day
I don't know what to say
I'm having, a real bad day
