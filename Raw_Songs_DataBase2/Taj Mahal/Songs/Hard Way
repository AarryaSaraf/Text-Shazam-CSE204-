Well, I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go
I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go

I've been down and out
When the ground was covered with snow

I used to get so worried
I could cry the whole night through
Yeah, all know I'd get so worried
I would cry the whole night through

Think about my troubles
And the hardships I've been through, yeah

Someday I may get lucky
And find me a place to go
You know someday I may get lucky
And find me a place to go

I've tried and tried
It's been a hard, hard way to go

Well, I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go
You all know I really had to suffer
I've had a hard, hard way to go

I've been down and out
When the ground was covered with snow
Yes, I have
