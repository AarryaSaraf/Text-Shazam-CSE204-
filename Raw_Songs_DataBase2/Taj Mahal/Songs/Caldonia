Walkin' with my baby, she got great big feet
Long, lean and lanky, ain't had nothing to eat
She's my baby
And I love her just the same
Always crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name

Caldonia, Caldonia
What make your big head so hard?
I love you, love you just the same
Always crazy 'bout you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name

My mama told me
She said, "Son, now listen
I'm your mama and I know better
You need to stay away from that woman"
But you know, mama did not know what Caldonia was putting down
So I'm going down to Caldonia's house one more time

Caldonia, Caldonia
What makes your big head so hard, honey?
I love you, love you just the same
I'm always crazy 'bout you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name
