Oh, I'm in love you
And, baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny
Oh, my darling, oh, my baby
I'm thrilled
And I always will
'Cause baby, you said yes to me
You really yes to me
And I look into the sky
'Cause babe, you like to mess with me
You really mess-a-mess-a-mess with me

In your heart
So deep a love I know
And your love, baby
Surely will grow and grow and grow
And grow and grow and grow

Ooh, lovin' you
Is all I really want to do
Baby, you my destiny
My brilliant destiny
And you know, and you know you can cook
Cooky-cooky-cooky-cook
Baby won't you cooky-cooky, cooky-cook for me
You cooky-cook for me
And you know that you
You know what you do, baby
To really get the juicy part of me
The ooy-gooy part of me

Baby now, in your heart
So deep a love I feel
And this time, I know, I know
That this love is real-real, real-real
But you're not real-real-real-real

Ooh, baby-baby, you
Baby-baby, baby-baby, you
Ma-ma-ma, baby you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny
And I, I lovin' you
And you know the reason why
'Cause baby, you my destiny
My brilliant destiny
But you are around me
Like the circle
Not the sun
Won't you do me, do me, do me
Like my evening
Like a 
Baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny

Ooh, I'm in love with you
And baby, you're my destiny
My brilliant destiny...

Destiny...
