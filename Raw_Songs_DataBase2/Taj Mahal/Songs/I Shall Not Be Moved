I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm on my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
On my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved
