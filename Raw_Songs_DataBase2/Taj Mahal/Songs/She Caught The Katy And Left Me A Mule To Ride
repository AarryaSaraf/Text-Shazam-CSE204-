She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
Well, my baby caught the Katy
She left me a mule to ride
The train pulled out and I swung on behind
I'm crazy 'bout her
That hard-headed woman of mine

Man, my baby long
Great, God, she mighty, she tall
You know my baby long
Great God, she mighty, my baby tall
Well, you know my baby, she long
My baby, she tall
She sleep with her head in the kitchen
And her big feet's out in the hall
And I'm still crazy about her
That hard-headed woman of mine

I love my baby
She's so fine
I wish she'd come to save me sometime
'Cause she don't believe I love her
Look what a hole I'm in
And she don't believe I'm singin'
What look what a shape I'm in

She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
She caught the Katy and left me a mule to ride
Well, my baby caught the Katy
Left me a mule to ride
The train pulled out and I swung on behind
Well, I'm crazy 'bout her
That hard-headed woman
Hard-headed woman of mine
