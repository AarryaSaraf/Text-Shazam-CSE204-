Like the stars in the Hawaiian sky
Sweet honey, you know you shine
There's none brighter, baby, in my eyes
I'm so happy that you're mine, all mine

Your smile is my sunny day
Chasing all my many troubles away
The way you kiss so tenderly
Don't you know you make my life complete?

And when I'm far away
In some old distant land
I know I can hold on
'Cause it won't be too long
Till I'm back in your arms

And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna love you right
I'll never let you go

Sugar, when I'm on my fishing boat
You're the star that leads me safely home
Other honey just don't taste as sweet
You're my one and only queen bee

'Cause your smile is my sunny day
Chasing my many troubles away
Baby, with you standing by my side
I'm gonna be happy till the end of time

It only takes one glance
Into those pretty eyes
I know I can walk the line
You and me, we'll be just fine
With your hand in mine

And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, ooh , baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna love you right
I'll never let you go
Ooh, and, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when you're close to me
Honey, what you do to me
I'll never let you go
And, oh, baby, when it's late at night
You know I'm gonna hold you tight
I'll never let you go
