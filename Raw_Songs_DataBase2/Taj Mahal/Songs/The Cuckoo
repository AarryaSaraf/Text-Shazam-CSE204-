You know the cuckoo
She's a pretty bird
Baby but she warble woman as she fly
But she never, never heard a cuckoo
Until the Fourth Day of July

Mama, mama
Ooh, sweet mama
Tell you boy not to be a gamblin' man
Cuz the card'll cheat em'
Lord they will beat him
And they'll leave him with a losin' hand

Jack o' Diamonds
Yeah, Jack o' Diamonds
Well, ya robbed my poor pocket o' silver and gold
First ya hurt me
Then ya desert me
Then ya leave me out in the cold

I'm gonna buy me
Baby, I'm gonna buy me
A little cabin on the mountain top
You know I'm gonna stay there
Baby I'm just gonna lay there
I don't care if the whole world come to a stop

You know the cuckoo is a pretty bird
Baby but she warble as she fly
But baby you never heard a cuckoo
Until the Fourth of July
