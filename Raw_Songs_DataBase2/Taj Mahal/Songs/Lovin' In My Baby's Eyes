Look here baby now you know I can
Be the one to be your man
Baby now you know I knew I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Oh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
See that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Look here baby now you know darn well
Love you better than another man could tell
Love you baby
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
I say lovin' in my baby's eyes
I say lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold your pictures to my breast
Love you baby
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
You see the lovin' in my baby's eyes
Have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

Love ya baby
Love ya baby
Mama now you know I do
Love ya baby
Love ya baby
Do anything for you

I said, late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold you pictures to my breast
Love you Mama
Now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Oh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me that magic in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
