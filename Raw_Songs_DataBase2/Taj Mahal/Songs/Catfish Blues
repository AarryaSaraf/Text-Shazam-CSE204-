Oh, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' into the deep blue sea
I'd have all the good lookin' women
Swimmin' after me
Swimmin' after me
Swimmin' after me

'Cause these blues, oh, these blues
'Cause I'm goin' to the little girl's house, oh
Maybe you can find her
Timbuktu to Bamako
Timbuktu to Bamako
Timbuktu to Bamako

Oh, I wish, oh honey, I can holler her
I keep on howlin' till I get
My baby back
Your baby back
My baby back

Well, it's two trains runnin'
Can never go my way
I'm gonna ride the first thing smokin'
Down the road I go
Down the road I go

Said now, I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' into the deep blue sea
I'd have all you good lookin' women
Swimmin' after me
Swimmin' after me
Swimmin' after me

Oh, rollin' on, oh, rollin' on
Oh, rollin' on, oh, rollin' on
