I spent last summer on an island, in the Mediterreannean Sea
The sunshine was so bright, yes, you know it burned me down to my soul
I wish everybody that I had to love was there with me
What a time, baby, what a time, I had when I was there

First I'm an African man, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

First I'm black African, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

First I'm an African man, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American

Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it let your body swim
Shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it shake it, baby, take a pull of rum again
If you have not had enough of it in your life, you just cannot have your fill

First I'm black African, second I'm black Jamacian, third I'm black American
