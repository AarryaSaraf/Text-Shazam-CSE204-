Frankie an' Albert was sweethearts
Lordy how they could love
Vowed to love one another
Baby 'neath the stars above
It was her man... an' he was doin' her wrong

Frankie went down to da' bar room
Get herself a bucket a beer
Say hey to da' lone bartender
Say hey has my lovely man been here?
It was my man... an' he was doin' me wrong

Bartender say "Miss Frankie, huh
Honey I can't tell ya' no lie
He lef' here 'bout an' hour ago
With that hussy named Nelly Blye"
It was yo' man... an' he was doin' you wrong

Frankie she cried, she cried, she cried
Lordy, what have I done?
I done give my love to dis man
He done took my love an' run
It was my man... an' he was doin' me wrong

Albert saw Frankie comin', He say
Oh Lord baby, don't you shoot
Well you know, out from under that red kimono
The gun went rootie toot toot
She shot that man... cause he was doin' her wrong

Boo Hoo! Boo Hoo! Boo Hoo! Boo Hoo!
Frankie say baby what have I done?
You know I shot the only man I loved
A Colt forty-one
It was my man... an' he was doin' me wrong

Play it for a while...

High Sheriff come clippety, clippety, clippety, clippety
Clippety, clippety, clippety the trail

You done shot yo' man
I'm gon' hafta' put cha in da' county jail
Talkin' 'bout that man... an' he was doin' her wrong

Frankie she laid in da' jail house
Now ya' know there ain't no one to go her bail
But 'cha know big Jim say honey
"I'm workin' on you, try to get you outta that jail"
Tell about yo' man...'cause he was doin' you wrong

An' our story go on...

Frankie an' Albert was sweethearts
Lordy how they could love
Vowed to love one another
Underneath the stars above
Talkin' 'bout that man... an' he was doin' her wrong
