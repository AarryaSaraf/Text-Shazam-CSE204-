On the beach overseas
Icy water slaps at our knees
And the buoy was signaling
As if it knew we were far from home

Then you looked at me
And all I could see
Were the lights that were flickering
And suddenly we were all alone

It's not an impossible thing to do
Yet I'm helpless to do anything for you
I can't keep from wondering

You were under a spell
Waiting for time to tell
If I could, you know I would
Accept this moment and sympathize

Then you looked at me
And then all I could see
Were the walls closing again
And the desperation in your eyes

It's not an impossible thing to do
I know there's a better life for you
I can't keep from wondering

It's not an impossible thing to do
And I'm helpless to say anything to you
I want to see a better life for you
But I can't keep from wondering
