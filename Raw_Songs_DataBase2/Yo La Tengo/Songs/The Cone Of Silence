When I think about he and she
It's far away enough for me to see
Worst day, it's been hard to shake

I think about you and me
With a little more frequency
But aside from that, it's about the same

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why

Sometimes I think about how I live
Not at all how I used to live
When it's put that way it don't feel bad

But when you act like you never care
Why do you think I was there?
I look around and I think that I was had

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why
