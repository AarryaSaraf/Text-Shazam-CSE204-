I don't care about your ways 
of love and life and walkin' 
And I don't care about your days 
Of carin' and not talkin' 
But It's all right the way that you live 
It's all right the way that you live 
It's alright 
I don't care about your present pay 
and your night life you keep burning 
And I don't care about what your old man says 
all the ways you have of learnin' 
It's your right the way that you live 
It's all right the way that you live 
You won't call 
It doesn't matter if your sun shines out in the evening 
Don't wait, it won't wait for you to come all night, come a-running.
I don't care about your ways 
of love and life and walkin' 
And I don't care about your days 
Of carin' and not talkin' 
It's alright the way that you live 
It's alright the way that you live 
It's alright the way that you live 
It's alright the way that you live
