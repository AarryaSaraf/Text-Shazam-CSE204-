Black on white
The background chess
You're racing time
Retracing steps
When are you coming to town?

Before the fall
Before the flood
After the sinking feeling and the final cut
What are you going to do?
We're all waiting for you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Outbound train is always late
We stay lost inside our day
Inbound train, engine blows
Approaches home, never slows

Outbound train is flashing red
We stay lost inside our head
Inbound train, engine blows
Approaches home, never slows

What are you going to do?
We're all waiting for you

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
