It's gonna be a bumpy night she said
Or something or other I didn't know
It's a messed-up situation
It's a stab in the back when you turn to gold
When you turn to gold

Yeah yeah, do you think it'll work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
I could think about it

What am I supposed to do now?
I had a chance in a million, it slipped away
There's a change in the weather coming
When what once was black and white will slowly turn to gray

Yeah yeah, do you think it'll work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
I could think about it

Yeah yeah, said do you think it could work all right?
Set your sight to be unafraid of
The harm that comes from change
Harm that comes from change
