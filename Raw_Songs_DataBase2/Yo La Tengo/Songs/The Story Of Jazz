Georgia left me alone last Wednesday night, 
So I went to New York, to see what Doug was up to. 
And I saw this band 
Their name escaped me by Thursday 
And the way it happend, looking, look for something to believe in. 
???, he's had another bad day 
The Italian thing, it's buggin' him more than he wants to admit. 
Yeah, it brings him down 
Sign a producer, don't matter at all. 
The way it happened, nothing lasts like you think it might. 
Well, naturally I was a little confused 
So I placed a call, person to person, 
Connect me to Steve Albini 
Let the phone ring twice 
When he answered I forgot everything I was gonna say
