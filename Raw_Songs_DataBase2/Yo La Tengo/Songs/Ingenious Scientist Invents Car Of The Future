The bean-powered car comes with nose plugs
When it starts up, you'll see what for
If you're standing down wind while it's running
The aroma is hard to ignore

The gas is caught in a funnel
Attached to a hole in the seat
The fumes flow out through the tailpipe
And leave stinkbombs all over the street
