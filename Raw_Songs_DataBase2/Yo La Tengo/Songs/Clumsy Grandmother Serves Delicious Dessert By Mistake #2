There were close to sixty candles
Burning on her birthday cake
She meant to blow them out
But blew them over by mistake
They flew across the table
Scattered everywhere
One landed in my cup of juice
One landed on my chair
One landed in my ice cream bowl
Yet it wasn't wasted
It made a Baked Alaska
Better than I'd ever tasted
