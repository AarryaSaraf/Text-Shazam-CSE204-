In the morning light
Your eyes are bright in the sun
Have you heard what I heard?
The traffic chirp like a bird

It's a symphony
I need you close to me
Maybe I'm dreaming, I'm awake
And the horns are singing for our sake

The night is alive
We don't need nothing to do
The night is alive
The buildings get lost in the mist of a view
And the light pounces high off the city sky

We don't need nothing to do
We don't need nothing to do
