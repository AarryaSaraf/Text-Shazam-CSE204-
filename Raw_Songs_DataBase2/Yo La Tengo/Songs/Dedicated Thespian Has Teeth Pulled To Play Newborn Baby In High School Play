He's very very very dedicated to his art.
He had the dentist pull his teeth
So he could get the part.
Now everything he does,
He does as practice for the play.
He kicks his feet and throws a fit
When things don't go his way.
Instead of sleeping in a bed,
He's sleeping in a crib.
And at the dinner table now,
He dribbles on his bib.
He puts his fingers in his food,
Then drops it on the floor.
Then he spills his cup of milk,
And screams for more.
His mother says his acting style
Is getting on her nerves.
He'll either give up,
Or get the spanking he deserves.
