Sitting at home inside yourself 
Thinking it's cool to be so reserved 
And it's kinda funny 
Lying in bed that night, wasting time, wasting time 
and I know how that is, want to know how that is 
How do these days go by, why does time move so slow 
When are my decisions made 
Make a new plan that you're gonna be strong 
Eat a bit of lunch and the moment's gone, 
But not quite forgotten. 
When you alone at night, reflecting time, reflecting time. 
And I know where that leads, want to know where that leads. 
How do these days go by, why does time move so slow 
When are my decisions made 
When that day comes, you're sure you're gonna know 
You're like some shy dog looking for the nerve, 
looking for the nerve to bite. 
Start to react, too smart to miss 
You're coming just til you resent 
It's turning into a problem 
Lying awake at night, just wasting time, wasting time 
And I know where that leads, do you want to know where that leads. 
How do these days go by, why does time move so slow 
How do these days go by, why does time move so slow 
When are my decisions made, I'll never know, I'll wonder.
