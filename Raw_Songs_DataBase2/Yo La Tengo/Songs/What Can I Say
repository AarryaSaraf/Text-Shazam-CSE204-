When we're alone here
Just me and you
Why did you tell me
You love me too?
And when I hold you
You turn away
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I don't know why
You run and hide
I don't know what
You feel inside
I try to tell you
In every way
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I don't know why
You run and hide
I don't know what
You feel inside
I try to tell you
In every way
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I just don't know you
What can I say?
