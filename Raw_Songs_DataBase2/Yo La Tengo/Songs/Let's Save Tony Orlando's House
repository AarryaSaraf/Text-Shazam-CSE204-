We proudly welcome Tony Orlando
The state fair marquee reads
Inside a thousand people with yellow ribbons sing
And clap on one and three

Watch him burn, he's dropping to his knees
Watch him burn, a medley, hits from Grease
Watch him burn, he never fails to please

Meanwhile in Tahoe outside Casa Tony
Wetting rags in gasoline
A jealous Frankie Valli says "Dawn, I want you back"
Lights a match and counts to three

Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene

Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene

We're sorry to inform you
Tony Orlando has been postponed
