For the moment slipped right through him
Combed his hair, combed his hair
Knew the feeling of contentment
An actors' actor
An actors' actor.

She smiled a smile uncomprehending
As he took his time, took his time.
Wore a hat, so he'd impress her.
Took a ride,
Took a ride.

Says, "I could wait for hours.
I could wait and never fall down,
Never fall down,
Never fall down."

Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river
Face down beside the river
