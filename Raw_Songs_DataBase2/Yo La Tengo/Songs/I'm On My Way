Sun shines through the window
There's nothing I could do
I tried to be brooding and dark
But it all fell through

I made you wait such a long time
I had to find it myself
I had to find it myself
In an only child's dream
And I will let go
And now the time has come
To me


Just for a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all

I use my imagination
As much as I can
But all I can think of is you
Can I hold your hand?

I never knew what a difference
A difference could make
Why don't we go for a ride?
Or just float into space
And that's what I thought


Just for a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all

Why don't we float off in to space?
For a day
Just for an hour
For awhile
I won't delay
I'm on my way
I won't be late
I'll be there
Baby that's all
