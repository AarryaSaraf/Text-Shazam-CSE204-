Nights are getting slower
Days are flying by
Hold me forever
Hold on while we cry

I looked everywhere for you
Just like yesterday
Look for you in my memories
You're far far away
And we beat on

Laugh away the bad times
Lie about what's to come
The less said, the better
Let's drink until we're dumb

One minute later
Than a minute ago
Tomorrow is forever
Let's pretend that we don't know
And we beat on

Nights are getting slower
The days, the days are flying by
Listening to the noise of the street
Sweep the tears aside

Shaken by the feeling
Shaken, misdirected, waylaid
Did I take it for granted
Now it's far far away
And we beat on
