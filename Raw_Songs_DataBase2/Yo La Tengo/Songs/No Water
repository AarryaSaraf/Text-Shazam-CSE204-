A dirty street outside my room, papers swirl around, 
Not a soul on a night of gloom, tries to stop a howl. 
Another day on a dismal beach, a seagull turns and flys by 
The waves seem so high and fierce, break and crash back down. 
If the worst should happen, or if it takes all day 
Or if the sun turns grey and cold 
Violent wind come blow me down 
Ring chimes with a haunting air 
The curtains whoop and the dogs they growl 
Otherwise a silent town
