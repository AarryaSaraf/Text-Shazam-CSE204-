I wonder what's on your mind
I wonder what's on your mind
Look around and see
What it does to me
I wonder what's on your mind

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it'll surely come
And it'll surely come
Here it comes again

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it will surely come
It will surely come
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
