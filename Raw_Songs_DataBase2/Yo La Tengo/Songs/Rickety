Way past late, rising sun
Four times four, one plus one
The path link home, the wait and see
Five times five, T minus three
Consult the map around the bend
Retrace our steps and until then
Through it all, we're on our feet
But rickety

Shady browns, setting sun
Stubby Kaye, Danny Dunn
Broken glass between our toes
Earl the Pearl Monroe
Nothing's gone and nothing lasts
The doors ajar and closing fast
Through it all, we're on our feet
But rickety

Steering gear to the side
Holding on, holding on to the other side

Dreaming on the astral plane
Where our worlds collide
Offering a love in vain
Holding on, holding on to the other side

Somewhere road, sometime soon
Teddy bears, Daniel Boone
More or less stick to the plan
Rag dolls, and Horace Mann
Drink until we're straight again
Make a fist and count to ten
Through it all we're on our feet
But rickety
