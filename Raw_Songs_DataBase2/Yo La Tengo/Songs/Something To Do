I took a ride by a police station
It seemed like something to do
I heard a voice saying, "What are you trying to prove?"

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I couldn't decide

Next thing I knew I was out and bound and
On my own again
I looked around to see what I could find

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I couldn't decide

There's a time when your life is full of meaning
That's the time that I'm looking forward to

I thought about it an hour
I thought about it a minute
And I thought about it for weeks on end
I never decide
