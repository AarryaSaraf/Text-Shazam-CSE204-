Whenever students misbehave
Or break the rules in school
They have to watch the principal
Acting like a fool

He thinks he's very funny
He thinks he's really clever
He makes us sit and watch
For what seems like forever

We sit on hardwood bleachers
In the auditorium
While he acts like Jerry Lewis
But his jokes are twice as dumb

The punishment should fit the crime
That ought to be the rule
This punishment's a little too
Unusual and cruel
