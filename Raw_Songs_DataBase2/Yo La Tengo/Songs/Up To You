Hold a mirror on your own true heart
You'll leave it to me or I won't let go
It's up to you

It wears me out
It's up to you

Take the beeline to your safety net
And don't wait for me
I'll only slow you down
It's up to you

It wears me out
It's up to you
It wears me out
It's up to you

When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone
When I go, you're already gone
