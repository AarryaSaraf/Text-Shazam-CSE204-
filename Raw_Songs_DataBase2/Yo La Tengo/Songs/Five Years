Five years, five years will wash this through my 
With no trace, angry and trouble go wild
Wishing when I knew that nothing's true
I turned to you and I knew

Nine years, nine years will turn my spirit cold
And I'll know, I'll know what life my years will hold
Feeling like I've lost all I know
I turned to you and I knew

But when I awake, I feel the cold
I've not too many years, but growing old
Sighing like a man who's seen too much
Like he's lost his touch
Like a man who's seen too much

Tonight I'll sit here waiting just the same
But no one but my ragged self to blame
Smiling when I see what life bring you
I turned to you and I knew

But when I awake, I feel the cold
I've not too many years, but growing old
Sighing like a man who's seen too much
Like he's lost his touch
Like a man who's seen too much
