Most pianos have 88 keys
But his has a hundred and nine
It plays extra low and extra high
And it all sounds extra fine
The low notes sound like a buffalo's snore
The middle notes sound like bees
The other end of the piano plays
A note like a hummingbird's sneeze
But he's not satisfied just yet
He wants one twice as big
It would roar like a summer thunderstorm
And screech like a squealing pig
