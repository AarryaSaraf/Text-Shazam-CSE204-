Wrote a sentence down, thought it out
I've pasted it on my walls
It's a sentence I can live with
And it goes like this
Oh, ah, oh, oh
After I looked at it
In my sleep, in my sleep
I bought a bag of oranges
With a bag of oranges
I planted oranges all over my bed
Well I'm trying to bite
And I often drink
I'm trying to bite one for a drink
I peel an orange
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with 
It's something I can't live with
