I put spots on a bird of paradise, snake eyes on a domino
When the bird devours the flower then you know

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away

Twisted branch of an aging sycamore
Spider veins across its leaves
Once I stood in its shadow
Watched the fire breathe

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away
Blow on the fir
Ashes blow away
Ashes blow away
