Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
'N' when the wheel don't turn
You don't roll no more

I dreamt last night
Ol' Lola was dead
I saw the apron string
All around her head

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
'N' when the wheel don't turn
You don't roll no more

Well I jumped a train
When I wanna go
And for where she's bound
Well, I don't wanna know

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow?
When the wheel don't turn
Well, you won't roll no more

Well, I've been drinkin' gin
I drank some whiskey too
Well, I got hooked
Oh, what you gonna do

Roll on babe
Don't you roll so slow
When the wheel don't turn
Well, you don't roll no more
