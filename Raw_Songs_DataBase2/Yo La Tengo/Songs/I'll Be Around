When I stare into space
I'm looking for you
And I can see you
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around

See the kaleidoscope girl
In the doorway
She's looking my way
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around

Washing the dirt from your face
I'm looking for you
And I still miss you
At times

I'll be around
To pick up your phone
I'll be around
