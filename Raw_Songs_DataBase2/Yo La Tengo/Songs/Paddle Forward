It's on my list, we've come undone
Grip tight point, over away from the shore
We feel safe inside, but not a wave in sight
Hello tide, the water's warm

After that we've come undone
Slipped again, lost at sea, cracking synagogue
But we could stand for now this warm is coming as
Hello tide

Once it's far too fast
Never seems to last
Hang in tight when you form this

Shoot with force, we've come undone
Riptide pourin', pourin' on in from the shore
We feel safe inside, but not a wave in sight
Hello tide, there's still time
The water's fine
