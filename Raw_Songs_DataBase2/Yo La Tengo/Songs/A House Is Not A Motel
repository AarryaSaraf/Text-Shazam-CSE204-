At my house I have got no shackles
You can come and see if you want to
In the walls you'll see the mantles
Where the light shines dim all around you
And the streets are paved with gold and if
Someone asks you, you can call my name

You're just a thought that someone
Somewhere, somehow feels you should be here
And it's so for real to see you
To smell, to touch, to know where you are here
And the streets are paved with gold and if
Someone asks you, you can call my name
You can call my name
I hear you calling my name!

By the time that I'm through singing
The bells from the schools of walls will be ringing
More confusions, blood transfusions
The news today will be the movies for tomorrow
And the waters turned to blood, and if
You don't think so
Go turn on your tub
And it's mixed with mud
You'll see it turn to gray
And you can call my name
I hear you calling my name
