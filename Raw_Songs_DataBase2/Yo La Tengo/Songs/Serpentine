In the middle of nowhere
Thought I heard a sound
Went to seek it out
Track it down

In the middle of nowhere
Broke out in sweat
And I don't know how I got there
All I knew was I was wet

There was no one, nobody there
I was tired and I was scared

Maybe next time I'll know better
Maybe I've learned nothing at all
Nothing at all 
Nothing at all 


I should have known...
I should have known...
I should have known...
