// The Cone Of Silence //

When I think about he and she
It's far away enough for me to see
Worst day, it's been hard to shake

I think about you and me
With a little more frequency
But aside from that, it's about the same

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why

Sometimes I think about how I live
Not at all how I used to live
When it's put that way it don't feel bad

But when you act like you never care
Why do you think I was there?
I look around and I think that I was had

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why

Just like the F train, you're not waiting
Just like the F train, there'll always be an F train
Unlike like the F train, I don't know just why
There must be a reason why

// Big Sky //

Big sky looked down at all the people looking up at the big sky
Everyone was pushing one another around
Big sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
Big sky's too big to let it get him down

Big sky's too big to cry
Big sky's too high to see
People like you and me

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down

And when I think
That the world's too much for me
I think of the big sky
And nothing matters much to me

Big sky looked down on all the people who think they have problems
They get depressed, they hold their head in their hands and they cry
People lift up their heads and look up to the big sky
Big sky's too big to sympathize

Big sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
Then he'd feel glad inside
Big sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down

And when I think
That the world's too much for me
I think of the big sky
And nothing matters much to me

// The Evil That Men Do //

It's a lot of time
It's a lot of time
For a man who walks on me
For a man who walks on me

That's the way it is
That's the way it is
When a man walks on me
When a man walks on me

// The Forest Green //

Says he's tired of people in black
The weight of the world on [?] backs
Life can hurt you, sit in the shade
[?] lemonade

This is through the way

Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait

She wakes up angry, says "I'll never learn"
Standing over her coffee and roasts til it burns
Can't eat the food here, it's made of chlorine
I want the path to the green, not the path to the gray

This is through the way

Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait, don't wait
Don't wait

// The Pain Of Pain //

There's a man, father of daughters
A man without a steady job
Through the years his plans are all empty
Tries to speak but his voice is hard

What could I say to that?
Courage I've never had to show
Time will come before I'm ready to face it
Breaking down all around me
Nothing I do is right

There was a man, forced to a flat land
Dreamed of returning to his home
He called to remind him of leaving
When his [?]

What could I say to that?
The courage I've never had to show
Times will come before I'm ready to face them
Breaking down all around me
Nothing I do is right

// The Way Some People Die //

It wasnt it more than a minute
That first one was the test
He was listening but i dont think he heard the rest
It was easy to fall, but not easy to take a stand
With the sound of her voice or the touch of her hand

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die

He doesnt think of tomorrow
and he seldom looks back
When he did he saw failure
and a future so black
So, he sees himself through sad eyes
That have never caught the look of love
He'll never see what hes giving up

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die

You might think hes a victim
He just thinks its a guess
Its not the question, its who you ask
and the boats fly on friday
and you're never gonna see him again
It wasn't love that did him in

Everyones heard the reasons why
A kid would let the poison creep inside
He said he wasn't scared, but you know he lied
The way some people die

// The Empty Pool //

Too unpressed for strategy so dignity must be spared
Watch the leaves in the empty pool as the widow drew her shade

Season was here
No drums to calm their fear
Let's drink the leper's beer

The leper's playing his salsa game and tempest swept dark land
The lover's turns and parasites over the frying pan

Coffee's brewed
And the men playing cards
And the mystery plane
And the forest winds
Their searching out overy the sea

// Alrock's Bells //

What am I wearing?
[?]
It passes me by
Why, oh why?

Why am I lonely?
I've just sat by
For so many years
Why, oh why?

I make the rounds to talk with you
A chance to causes number one
I wonder where my rabbit hole
I'm through changing
I'll be just who I want

My love

I came here to the city
When it wasn't hard to live
Manufacturer on a side street
Til I had to sell it out and move away
Why, oh why?

Many cold nights go by
I sit home wondering why
Did I get tired of hating?
I'm through caring
I'll wear bells if I wanna

Playing around
Playing around
Playing around

// Five Years //

Five years, five years will wash this through my [?]
With no trace, angry and trouble go wild
Wishing when I knew that nothing's true
I turned to you and I knew

Nine years, nine years will turn my spirit cold
And I'll know, I'll know what life my years will hold
Feeling like I've lost all I know
I turned to you and I knew

But when I awake, I feel the cold
I've not too many years, but growing old
Sighing like a man who's seen too much
Like he's lost his touch
Like a man who's seen too much

Tonight I'll sit here waiting just the same
But no one but my ragged self to blame
Smiling when I see what life bring you
I turned to you and I knew

But when I awake, I feel the cold
I've not too many years, but growing old
Sighing like a man who's seen too much
Like he's lost his touch
Like a man who's seen too much

// Screaming Dead Balloons //

I sit on my lawn
Watching cars go by
I'd stay inside
Under [?]

I'm not lying no more
Not afraid or alone anymore
Not afraid of the daybreak
I feel like [?] or being alone
Being alone now

When it's all been decided for you
When I'm waiting for eternal fight
And it's all just a matter of facts
It's a long goodbye

I sit in my room
With the curtain pulled tight
Sleep away the afternoon
Stay awake all night

I'm not laughing no more
Not afraid or alone anymore
Not afraid of the daybreak
[?] being alone
All alone now

When it's all been decided for you
When I'm waiting for eternal fight
And it's all just a matter of facts
It's a long goodbye

// A House Is Not A Motel //

At my house I have got no shackles
You can come and see if you want to
In the walls you'll see the mantles
Where the light shines dim all around you
And the streets are paved with gold and if
Someone asks you, you can call my name

You're just a thought that someone
Somewhere, somehow feels you should be here
And it's so for real to see you
To smell, to touch, to know where you are here
And the streets are paved with gold and if
Someone asks you, you can call my name
You can call my name
I hear you calling my name!

By the time that I'm through singing
The bells from the schools of walls will be ringing
More confusions, blood transfusions
The news today will be the movies for tomorrow
And the waters turned to blood, and if
You don't think so
Go turn on your tub
And it's mixed with mud
You'll see it turn to gray
And you can call my name
I hear you calling my name
