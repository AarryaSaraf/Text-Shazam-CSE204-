// Decora //

I see you crawling across the floor
Never see you standing anymore
You take whatever's put in your hand
You ask for more until you can't

Decora

It's not the first time you'll take a fall
Act like you've never sleen double before
We tie deep into the past
Take this chance with me cause it's your last

// Flying Lesson (Hot Chicken #1) //

Eyes go places that you can't see
It's not that easy to hide from me
I hear the whispers everywhere I go
I hear the laughter everywhere I go

3 AM with the TV on
4 AM, TV on
The nervous ticking of my heart
Restlessness when we're apart

Think about the last thing that we said
Again and again it runs through my head
And I hear footsteps that aren't yours
They sound like yours, but they all do

Not much left for me to pray
Why sleep or dream when I'm awake
My eyes in places you forgot to look
My eyes in places you forgot to look

// The Hour Grows Late //

As he fired up the drum machine
He stole a glance at the empty seats
He took a minute to retune his guitar
As the hour grew late

I wanna send this out to Richie Vey
In his thrift-store corner of the world
His soul is my cheap laugh
As the hour grows late

// Tom Courtenay //

Julie Christie, the rumors are true
As the pages turn, my eyes are glued
To the movie star and his sordid life
Mr. Ex and his old-suffering wife
I spent so much time dreaming about Eleanor Bron
In my room with the curtains drawn
See her in the arms of Paul
Say it, I can say no more
As the music swells somehow stronger from adversity
Our hero finds his inner peace
So now I'm looking for a lucky charm
With a needle hanging out of its arm

As time goes by I know it's gonna happen
I know it's going away
Gonna take its toll, gonna take its toll
Gonna take my time
And I'm thinking about the way things are
And I'm thinking about the way things were
Thinking about Eleanor Bron
And I'm thinking about a lucky charm
And I'm thinking about the needle
Oh, I'm thinking about the needle
And I'm thinking about..

// Pablo And Andrea //

Show me where you keep all your secrets upstairs
Night after night you sleep while they're setting off flares

Someone came and took all the roses away
Now you'll sit showing me tears if you want me to stay
Cause down the street all the meters have run out of time
Run out of time

I waited for you as the trees swayed out of time
In a crowded room I pick up your lonely stare
I'll cover for you like a slipcover covers a chair
But someone came and took all the roses away
It was only 5 minutes, it felt like it stretched into a day
Someone came and took all the roses away

Took all the roses away
Took all the roses away

// Paul Is Dead //

Walking on 10th Street
The guy in front of me, Walkman, headphones on, Stones cranked
The thing that caught my ear, singing loud and clear
Well every couple of steps I heard "Woo-woo"
And he said it so un-self-consciously
That never it would occur to me that
He revealed himself
and I'd offer a blue

I was drunk the night we met, I might try to forget
Except I know so were you
I don't really care, cause we went on from there
And I try not to hide from what is true
The other night I had this dream
You told me what you want from me
I gave it to you instantly
and I woke up without a clue

// False Alarm //

Oh no, I think I'm falling for a false alarm
Like an all-day second stuck
Until you crunch the right arm
Well if I open my eyes, if I just pay attention to McNew
Well, I just held back
To listen to your cues
So it's not enough I never meant to hold you down
Waiting for the firestorm
Waiting for the false alarm

Well, is it really true? Well, I know, I mean I guess, uh, why not
Well is it really true, I don't know,
Too hard to figure out
I'm gonna mark my words, cross my eyes and stomp my feet
Cause I don't want you feeling bad, feeling bad, feeling
Worse than you do
Well, I'll stand my ground, hide behind a fake smile
Think I'll talk about something else
Just for a little while

Aw, said it once, said it twice, said it - you can tell it's the same old tune
Straight down to the bitter end
Tell me when there's more to go there soon
It's gonna hold my tongue in place, think about what to do
If you don't see nothing wrong this time
Well I'm taking it out on you

// Don't Say A Word (Hot Chicken #2) //

Don't say a word
I am only sleeping
I haven't the nerve to tell you any more

You won't lie
If I go now
And the world won't know what trouble I'm in

Drift on, baby, leave
And I won't run from you
I will never look back at shadows
When it makes me come running
I'd never go talk to strangers anyway

// (Straight Down To The) Bitter End //

People say that once you dyed your hair
You started showing up everywhere
Well you're standing tall, and you've got nothing at all
So you grab at everything you see

Now the world keeps spinning when you die
While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal sights

Drags up baggage, pretend to read
Demand the pages that you'll never redo
Sun sets down on your skittish heart
Cedar mile, how it's coming apart

Now the world keeps spinning when you die
While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal fights

Pickled eels, lemon peels
Hired hand picks you something new
Rainbow nights, stunning whites
Stars that shine but don't belong to you
The passive fools by the swimming pool
You'll fit right in with their pathetic grins
Stunning tricks, bottomless pits
You remind me where I don't want to be

While the lights keep flashing in the sky
They'll be sighing after normal sights
Now the world keeps spinning when you die

// My Heart's Reflection //

Got something to say, sit down on the bed
Something that I usually leave unsaid
It doesn't come so easily, I guess that's no surprise
I wanna see my heart's reflection in your eyes

Let's lock the door, hide the key
I'll try to look like you if you'll dress up like me
And you play dumb and I'll play too, nobody has to know
I wanna see my heart's reflection in your eyes
In your eyes

Let's jump this ship, let's cut out
Let's get into the wagon and drive until the motor falls out
I want just us two, I don't want to have to hide my heart
I wanna see it in your eyes as we ride on and on

// Attack On Love //

'There is a group of young Chinese who love music as their manner of
expression. They find love in adversity and dedication. They represent
dramatic, living love.'

Let's go change, you hokey little runt who wanted to dance, maybe fifteen
years old, maybe sixteen years old, she says, "Hey man, you all suck!" So I
get on up there, put her on her little ass with my honky stuff, with this
attack on love. A little later on, it don't matter when, I get up back on
the dance floor again. I say, "Hey, baby, what's your name? What's your
name? What bothers you today? Are you ready for a little something to do?"

// Blue Line Swinger //

You, you won't talk about what we see when the lights are out
And I'm willing to hold your hand while you're lost,
while you're so full of doubt
Walk for miles, on your own loose ends, I'll find you there
I'll find you there

You, you walk up thin blue lines possible with reality
And I, I see through small red eyes,
glowing still at your uncertainty
Out of darkness you will come around, I know you will
I know you will
And I'll find you
And I'll find you there
