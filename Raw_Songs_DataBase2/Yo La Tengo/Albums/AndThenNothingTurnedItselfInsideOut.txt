Album: AndThenNothingTurnedItselfInsideOut

// Everyday //

I want summer's sad songs behind me
I want a laugh a minute without fail
Want to be Paul Le Mat in 1980
Looking to forget tomorrow, looking everyday

I want to see you put your hands together
I want to cross my heart, I want to hope to die
I hear Kate Moss talk, she talks to me
She's looking for a new beginning everyday

When Monday comes I want nothing
Come Tuesday morning I want the same
The days and nights fly by
Looking to embrace the nothing of the everyday

// Our Way To Fall //

I remember a summer's day
I remember walking up to you
I remember my face turned red
And I remember staring at my feet

I remember before we met
I remember sitting next to you
And I remember pretending I wasn't looking

So try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might, try and make it ours
'Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

I remember your old guitar
I remember, I can't explain
I remember the way it looked around your neck
And I remember the day it broke

I remember the song you sang
I remember the way you look tonight
And I remember the way it made me feel

We'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might we'll try and make it ours
'Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

You'll try and try even if it lasts an hour
With all our might try and make it ours
'Cause we're on our way
We're on our way to fall in love

Yeah, we're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love
We're on our way to fall in love

// Saturday //

The room was filled with talk
For anyone listening
I found a spot by the door
With no one around

Let my mind go
Out of tune, out of tune

I kept a smile on my face
For anyone looking
Tried to turn away questions
Before he asked

Let my mind go
Out of tune, out of tune

I was engrossed in the film
Without really watching
Said, "Who's the guy with the gun?"
As if I was involved

Let my mind go
Out of tune, out of tune

// Let's Save Tony Orlando's House //

We proudly welcome Tony Orlando
The state fair marquee reads
Inside a thousand people with yellow ribbons sing
And clap on one and three

Watch him burn, he's dropping to his knees
Watch him burn, a medley, hits from Grease
Watch him burn, he never fails to please

Meanwhile in Tahoe outside Casa Tony
Wetting rags in gasoline
A jealous Frankie Valli says "Dawn, I want you back"
Lights a match and counts to three

Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene

Watch it burn, reluctantly he leaves
Watch it burn, acrid smoke making him wheeze
Watch it burn, humming "Sherry," splits the scene

We're sorry to inform you
Tony Orlando has been postponed

// Last Days Of Disco //

Saw you at a party, you asked me to dance
Said the music was great for dancing
I don't really dance much, but this time I did
And I was glad that I did this time

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

I wasn't dressed right, I rarely am
You told me that you didn't care
I laughed as you wobbled in your platform shoes
You laughed when I called Andrea true Anita Ward

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more

Where I belong
Where I belong

And the song said "Let's be happy," I was happy
It never made me happy before
It asked "Do you remember?" and I remember
Remember like it wasn't long ago

And the song said "Don't be lonely," it makes me lonely
I hear it and I'm lonely more and more
Where I belong
Where I belong

// The Crying Of Lot G //

What did I miss here?
What can't you take anymore?
Expecting a whisper
I heard the slam of a door

You say that all we ever do is fight
Gee, I don't know that that's true
Then I wonder, am I right?
Or is that part of our problem?

Maybe I'm out of my mind
Maybe I'm blocking out the truth
But it seems like just a little thing
Like you don't want to listen and I can't shut up

You don't have to smile at me
We don't have to talk
All that I ask is you stop
And remember it isn't always this way

You have the problem
It comes with our private jokes
When you're in a fury
Laughter gets stuck in my throat

Sometimes I wonder why we have so much trouble cheering each other up sometimes
When one or the other of us is down
Instead it's like, when you're in a bad mood, I look at you and I think
Maybe she's knows something I don't know, maybe I should be upset

You don't have to smile at me
We don't have to talk
All that I ask is you stop
And remember it isn't always this way

The way that I feel when you laugh
Is like laughing
The way that I feel when you cry
Is so bad

// You Can Have It All //

If you want, want my love
Take it baby
If you want, want my heart
Take it baby, you can have it all

If you want, want my time
Take it baby
And if you want my last dime
Take it baby, you can have it all

Take it baby, you can have it all

// Tears Are In Your Eyes //

You tell me summer's here
And the time is wrong
You tell me winter's here
And your days are getting long

Tears are in your eyes tonight

You tell me that you haven't
Slept in days
You tell me sleeping only makes you tired
Anyway

Tears are in your eyes tonight
Tears are in your eyes every night

Although you don't believe me, you are strong
Darkness always turns into the dawn
And you won't even remember this for long
When it ends all right

Please tell me how you know tomorrow
Staring at your shoes

Tears are in your eyes every night
Tears are in your eyes every night
Tears are in your eyes tonight

// Cherry Chapstick //

Someone else's date, someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry Сhapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me 

Night and day, swingers on the move
Wondering what it could be like if I could be that smooth
I could think about all that I missed out
It's hard to do

Someone else's date, someone else's door
There's a girl with cherry Сhapstick on and nothing more
It's such a lurid pose and she seems this close
But not to me

Running 'round in circles all day long

// From Black To Blue //

Several times over several days
I wasn't blind but I acted that way
Causing you pain
Well now I have to explain

As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now

Cooler than me, my confidence high
Reset the scene, no way to deny it
Finally I won
And then I was undone

As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now

As the empty feeling turns from black to blue
I can't believe this never happens to you
I see it on the TV and I laugh out loud
But it's the way I feel right now

// Madeline //

Madeline, hair in your eyes
With the voice as soft as satin
Madeline, you'll surely find
Smiles from inside a worried glance

You always kept me waiting
Somehow I never seem to mind
When the wind has caught your sail
Come back and see me, Madeline

Madeline, after a while
They found your photo in a drawer
Madeline, from another time
I caught you standing in a door

When you were asked if we were sisters
You replied you weren't sure
If the fog should ever lift
Come back and see me, Madeline

Will you always keep me waiting?
Somehow I'm running out of time
When the wind has caught your sails
Come back and see me, Madeline

// Night Falls On Hoboken //

Frightened face
Worried dream
Break my heart
With your sad scream

Sun is down
Spirits low
Hate my impatience
And here I go

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try?
Can't we try?

Come on, sleep one night peacefully
When I'll yawn all day easily
And rest up my mind

Weary guise
Mine the same
Why so worried?
You can't explain

Come on, let's leave our misery
And crawl toward where we want to be
Can't we try?
Can't we try?

Come on, sleep one night peacefully
Then I'll yawn all day easily
