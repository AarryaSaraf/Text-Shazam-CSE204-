Album: TheresARiotGoingOn

// Shades Of Blue //

Laid in my room to reflect my mood
Facing my feelings with a life without you
Orange and yellow

Doesn't matter what's the use
Whenever I see him, there are shades of blue

Staring at walls when I'm feeling down
Staying indoors 'cause your not around
Indigo violet
Doesn't matter, what's the use?
Whenever I see him, there are shades of blue

Shades of blue

Choosing a color for my particular point of view
Kidding myself
There are shades of blue

Whenever I see him
Oh shades of blue

// For You Too //

I am just some guy barely polite
The civil tongue and I barely collide
It builds inside until I just let it fly

I am just some guy with too much pride
And all that that implies
I won't tonight
Way too snide
It's not hard to verify

But if it's not too late
If I could protect you
Whenever you expect me to for you
When everything's hurting
Things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy

But if it's not too late
If I could protect you, whenever you expect me to for you
Whenever there's hurting things are uncertain
Maybe I could be that guy, I'd like to try

// Ashes //

I put spots on a bird of paradise, snake eyes on a domino
When the bird devours the flower then you know

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away

Twisted branch of an aging sycamore
Spider veins across its leaves
Once I stood in its shadow
Watched the fire breathe

Blow on the fire
Ashes blow away
Blow on the fir
Ashes blow away
Ashes blow away

// Polynesia #1 //

I'm going
To Polynesia
I'm going
At my leisure

I'm going
Before the snow flies
I'm going
As the crow flies

There ain't nobody
Who got to tell me
How I
Take my liberty

I'm going to Polynesia
As the crow flies
The reason I'm going
Is because I [?] wise

// Above The Sound //

What if we're too black and blue
To spot our latest bruise
Me and you, the heavy bag
For here for now

For us one thing to do
See if this'll work for you
Cry and hue, let's push our way
Above the sound
Over sideways down, above the sound
Over sideways down, above the sound

What if we bear it with a grin
To take it on the chin
Me and you, point one way
For the ground

For all our heads may spin
See if we can look within
To find another way
Above the sound
Word gets round, goin' down, above the sound
Word gets round, goin' down, above the sound

// Let's Do It Wrong //

I've been outsmarted
Everybody's pawn
I'm the one that's easiest to string along
But now I know better
It's time for this dog to have its day
No advice, sweet and nice
Let's do it wrong

I've been a fool
Since I was born
I'd have to say more idiot than savant
But now I know better
This cat will tree its prey
I repeat, nice and sweet
Let's do it wrong

In a sense, a swan song
My critique, so to speak
Let's do it wrong

// What Chance Have I Got //

Turn back, look at me
Believe in what you see
You may stumble away
I cannot
Fire at will
What chance have I got

Come back, can it be
How can you disagree
If your doubt's so strong
Though mine is not
Shoot to kill
What chance have I got

If that's not enough
And I know it's not
Stand your ground
What chance have I got

Hands outstretched
What chance have I got

// Forever //

Nights are getting slower
Days are flying by
Hold me forever
Hold on while we cry

I looked everywhere for you
Just like yesterday
Look for you in my memories
You're far far away
And we beat on

Laugh away the bad times
Lie about what's to come
The less said, the better
Let's drink until we're dumb

One minute later
Than a minute ago
Tomorrow is forever
Let's pretend that we don't know
And we beat on

Nights are getting slower
The days, the days are flying by
Listening to the noise of the street
Sweep the tears aside

Shaken by the feeling
Shaken, misdirected, waylaid
Did I take it for granted
Now it's far far away
And we beat on

// Here You Are //

[Voicemail]

We are out of words
We're out of time
Believe the worst

While we, we gasp the air
Grasp at straws
No longer there

Eyes shut, blinded
Darkness without dawn
We, we had our run, we're gone

We ignore the crap
Don't answer questions
We didn't ask

Most days, we circumvent
Tune out the world
Except our friends

Eyes shut, blinded
Road remains clear
Always on the run, we're here
