// Did I Tell You //

Did I tell you of the dark lonely road
I was counting my steps as I made my way home
Days of nothing but time on your hands, weighing on me
Came to my end, undecided
Whether to count what I felt against what I could say
I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
'Cause deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait.
Our love is so important to me
Starts wherever you land, walks right over to me
Days of nothing but time in between, obviously
So unwary, so uncaring
I try not to be part of that, well, that's easy to say
That I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
'Cause deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait.
There's a moment to discover no one can take all the blame
And it's finally clear.
I try not to wonder, or tell you that I'm not willing to wait
When deep in my heart I'm willing, heart's still willing
My brain's impatient, my heart's still willing to wait,
Willing to wait, willing to wait

// Can't Forget //

Seems like falling down
Or away lost at sea
Or the one that's left behind
Or the wake of you and me

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

I know where I am
Every day every night
Like the one who knows too much
Trusts the same old thing

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

Realizing nothing
I remember when

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
But I can't forget the time

Maybe I know that
Maybe it's better
Maybe it's nothing
But I can't forget the time

// Griselda //

Come won't you walk with me Griselda,
wearing the dress that moonlight shines through.
I am a sad and lonely boy,
since your mother said I couldn't see you.

Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

Do you recall last night Griselda?
Learning the lessons nature taught us.
Watching the fish up the lake,
it was lovely till your mother caught us.

Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

Moonflower find upon the window,
give me a foothold for my finding.
I've got a row boat on the lake.
Fishing around and all the sun was shining.

Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

I've got a jug of wine Griselda.
Why must you waste your time in sorrow?
Hold out your hand; have no fear.
If we're caught, I'll marry you tomorrow.

Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

Slipping through the wood in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

// Here Comes My Baby //

In the midnight moonlight I'll, be walkin a long and lonely mile.
And every time I do, I keep seein this picture of you.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

You never walk alone, and you're forever talkin on the phone.
I've tried to call you names, but every time it comes out the same.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

I'm still waitin for your heart, cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start.
You'll be mine to hold each day, but 'till then, this is all that I can say.

Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
And it can come as no surprise to me, with another guy.
Here comes my baby, here she comes now,
Walking with a love, with a love that's all so fine,
Never could be mine, no matter how I try.

// Yellow Sarong //

A man in the moon,
Taps at the window,
How will we know your silhouette?
How will we reach you?

Waving his hands,
Shouting,
Is there anymore to that yellow sarong?
It's more than just a bit of grass,
What a landscape.
(What a landscape)

Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.
A man in the moon,
Taps at the window,
How will we know your silhouette?
How will we reach you?
(How will we reach you?)

Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Yeah yeah yeah.

// You Tore Me Down //

Everybody knows
That you've been untrue
You've gone and broke my heart
And made me blue

Turn my head around
When you tore me down

If I had a choice
I might be sad
'cause when I hear yr voice
It makes me glad

Baby's not around
But she's leaving town

Baby
Baby
Don't run away
I want you to stay
I'm sorry
So sorry
I made you blue
And now you should be sorry too
Should be sorry too

Now I'm so alone
Yr far away
I sit here at home
No words to say

To anyone around
'cause you tore me down

Tore me down
Tore me down
Tore me down

// Tried So Hard //

Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
Cause she is moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go
Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities it's not the first break I've had
And I just can't let it bring me down too low
And though I tried so hard to please her
There must be something more to know
Never thought that we would find our end this way
It seemed that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine
So I'll stop and look right past the pain
Cause I've been in love before and I can love again
While she's moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

// The Summer //

On darkened streets tonight
I see a simple time
I see the warning light
And the summer comes undone
No sorry closing eyes
No cutting down to size
No other thoughts arise
And the summer come undone

On darkened streets tonight
I make a wrong turn right
Take in the lonely sight
And the summer comes undone

And I won't wait
And I won't have to
I just waste me time alone
'Til the summer comes undone
'Til the summer comes undone
'Til the summer comes undone

// Oklahoma, USA //

All life we work, but work is a bore
If life's for livin', what's livin' for?
She lives in a house that's near decay
Built for the industrial revolution
But in her dreams, she is far away, far away
In Oklahoma, U.S.A.

With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea
As she buys her papers at the cornershop
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top
'Cause in her dreams, she is far away, far away
In Oklahoma, U.S.A.

She walks to work, but she's still in a daze
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day
And Errol Flynn wants to take her away
To Oklahoma, U.S.A.

All life we work, but work is a bore
If life's for livin', what's livin' for?

// What Comes Next //

I been back and forth
Around and 'roudn
Taking back the last thing that I say
And it made me wonder
Made me wonder just where I went wrong
On a lazy drive I don't know where
Didn't even care if I got home
And it made me wonder
Made me wonder how I could be good
Time won't wait for you
I'll wait for you always
Some things should never change
And it made me wonder
When you wonder just what happens next

// The One To Cry //

I told you if I ever caught you fooling round again
That if you were untrue
That you and I are through
But now I've caught you and I know that this should be the end

Though I should tell you so
My heart keeps saying no
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry

Oh I can't bare to be the one to keep you from my side
How could you be so cruel 
You played me for a fool
But if I change my mind then I would throw away my pride

So now what should I do
Oh how I wish I knew
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry 
Cry cry cry cry

So now what should I do 
Oh how I wish I knew
Oh if I say goodbye then I am gonna be the one to cry

Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry
Cry cry cry cry

// Andalucia //

Andalucia when can I see you
When it is snowing out again
Farmer John wants you
Louder and softer closer and dearer
Then again
Needing you taking you keeping you leaving you
In a year and a day to be sure
That your face doesn't alter
Your words never falter - I love you

Ill be here waiting later and later
Hoping the night will go away
Andalucia castles and christians
Andalucia come to stay
You were lost, once before, on a day much like this
When you'd made up your mind not to come
And I couldn't persuade you
Or wait till tomorrow - or pass the time

// What Can I Say //

When we're alone here
Just me and you
Why did you tell me
You love me too?
And when I hold you
You turn away
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I don't know why
You run and hide
I don't know what
You feel inside
I try to tell you
In every way
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I don't know why
You run and hide
I don't know what
You feel inside
I try to tell you
In every way
I just don't know you
What can I say?
I just don't know you
What can I say?
