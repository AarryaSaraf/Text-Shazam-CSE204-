Album: MayISingWithMe

// Detouring America With Horns //

You know the way to my enemies
You keep your eyes on my enemies
Calling me backwards
Stringing along my heart (that way)
You're on your way to my enemies
You're moving in on my memories
Calling me over
Taking this heart of mine (away)

// Upside-Down //

Mary calls from far away
Sure there is another
Walks the floor cause she can't settle down

Waiting for the phone to ring
Stuck inside the bedroom
Drinks too much to make the room spin round

When she sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-down

Knowing if she'll just admit
One revealing detail
She can't hide her state of mind behind

She sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-down

Everybody wants to be the lucky guy
They're just uncertain how to please her

Everybody stops to see the setting sun
They're not just looking for the time

Caring not what people say
At other people's parties
Mary finds someone and settles down

She sits down
No one knows the world is upside-down
Watches how it spins around
No one knows the world is upside-down

// Mushroom Cloud Of Hiss //

See you walking sometimes, circumstances start to happen after awhile 
and it's starting to seem like there's nothing left 
like there's nothing left at all 
Well it drags me down, it's pulling me down 
lower, lower 
I feel it pullin, here it comes 
So come on take the time, 
come on, to make up your mind, 
come on, Let's give it all away 
Starts to wear me down 
And I can't get it to stop 
When's it gonna stop 
Look on your face, just the look on your face 
Makes me feel all a little down, down inside 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away 
Come on, take the time, come on, make up your mind, come on 
Let's give it all away

// Swing For Life //

Oh, true rider, fasten me
I saw a mystery, mystery
How you cast your reins aside,
and sidle up to me, up to me
Sweet obsession, devil's den
Lassos my blind eye
My blind eye, my blind eye
Oh, true rider, nothing's lost
Take me for a ride, for a ride

// Five-Cornered Drone (Crispy Duck) //

Time waits for reason
but there's no reason
Things just go wrong, they always do
Nothing works out right, though you try and try
You can search, you can look all around you
With both eyes open, but it doesn't matter
It's always the same, it's always like that,
you try and try and try

// Always Something //

Well, it's raining outside 
At least it's gotta be somewhere 
There's a long dark cloud just moving around 
Moving around 
Over nothing town 
And it's always something 
And it's always a touch of the same 
Well, the light is on 
And I have to see you 
But it wasn't glowing 
And it wasn't on 
I'd love to know 
How much it glows 
And it's always something 
And it's always something 
And it's always something, touch of the same 
And it's always something 
And it's always something, touch of the same 
touch of the same, touch of the same

// 86-Second Blowout //

See myself as a bug on the table
Find a way, but I gotta come down
When I do there's gonna be some decisions to make
See yourself as a weight on my shoulders
Shruggin' it off, will I still fall down
Back it up, let's see if that matters
I don't mind
Everyone's got a million opinions
One or two are gonna be all right
Let's take a chance and just see if this is one of those

// Out The Window //

I'm sitting round like I got nothing to do 
Got something to say, but not to you, not now 
I'm just waiting for the back and forth that won't begin 
Back to back, that won't seem to end 
I'm here waiting for a sign 
Everything goes out the window 
Watching you walk out the door tonight 
When my hope falls, bounces off you, hits the floor 
splits into 2 or 3 pieces. 
Well, I'm still waiting on it, 
down and down to the empty space where it lays 
Where it falls apart 
I'm stuck waiting for some sign. 
Everything goes out the window 
Watching you walk out the door 
I wrote a letter to my oldest friend, 
forgot it for awhile. 
Then on second thought, I read it through and threw it out, 
I'm through waiting on a sign.

// Satellite //

A lonely walk until the heaven's break 
Come back home and see what's changed 
Flipped the TV on and every channel's got some satellite 
A broken shoe to practice walking straight 
Take a little step and stop to think 
About the planets and the atmosphere 
and the satellites 
Wait for the day to come, the day to go 
Take all the needles from your hair 
See how the things that happen 
never really ever happen with a thought unaware 
Around the corner, a while to zero in 
And feel for where it ought to be 
If not the nuts and bolts and that'll come 
Like a satellite 
Wait for the day to go, the day to come...
