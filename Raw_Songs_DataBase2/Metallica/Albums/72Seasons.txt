// 72 Seasons //

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shot down
Traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone
Dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down
Volcanic
But what is done is done and done
Look back
Psychotic
No chance before this life began

Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shoot back
Erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask
Chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back
Fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back
Narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Piercing through
Cut in two
Polarize
Point of view
Crash into
Paralyze

Feeding on the wrath of man

Man down
Barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed
Stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down
Demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back
Hypnotic
There's breathing out but not back in

Staring into black light
Permanently midnight

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Feeding on the wrath of man

// Shadows Follow //

Hanging by a thread as I play dead
Hanging by a thread and my mind is code red
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Shut my eyes, just to hide from the fate
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Cover up, get shelter from the hate

Demonized, liquified, tranquilized
Prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay
Come what may, not to face that fight

Seething
Breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Never can I stop 'cause they hunt me
Never can I stop 'cause the beast is hungry
Like a wolf on the hunt stalking prey
Closing in, no, it won't let me be
Like a wolf on the hunt stalks a prey
Any cost, fulfill a destiny

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow
On I run
But still my shadows follow

Cut and run, hide away from fate
Cover up, try to hide the hate
Like a wolf, it won't let me be
Closing in, wish away, shut my eyes

Wish it away

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Facing
My demons
Now I know
If I run
Still my shadows follow

I say "No!"
Still my shadows follow

// Screaming Suicide //

Welcome to this life
Born into the fight
Here to claim your dream
Look you in the eye
Patch the broken sky
Craving dopamine
Then my voice appears
Teaching you of fears
Are you good enough?
You don't recognize
Head is full of lies
You should just give up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remember you're to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Curse another day
Spirit locked away
Punish and deprive
Hate to be awake
Living a mistake
More dead than alive
Then a voice appears
Whisper in your ears
"You are good enough"
Throwing down a rope
A lifeline of hope
Never give you up

Listen well, better listen well
Listen well, better listen well

Don't ever speak my name
Remember you're to blame
Keep me inside
Keep me inside
My name is suicide

Terrified in sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

My lying voice inside
Keeps drinking cyanide
And no more can you run
Into the sun

Terrified, sleepless nights
Caught in spotlight dead to rights
Isolate and fight your mind
Telling you you're left behind

And now you speak my name
You've given back the blame
Keep me deep inside
Don't you keep me inside
Screaming suicide

Now that I'm exposed inside
Shined a light on cyanide
I'm no longer needed here
Now you've faced your biggest fear

// Sleepwalk My Life Away //

Take a deep, waking breath
Hope the blood arrives
Burn my eyes with the sun
And pretend I'm alive
It never will appear
Strong as past desire
Light warming disappears
Like a cold, dead fire

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Stagger on through the fog
In the midnight sun
Shouting out at the shapes
Of the nameless no ones
All isn't what it seems
Cannot comprehend it
Captive inside a dream
Where the dawn won't end it

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

// You Must Burn! //

Catch a fire and burn all the misery
Foul fingers spin mob mentality
Anger on the rise as the flames grow higher
Choke on the smoke of the funeral pyre
Backfire

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
Who's the next witch you must burn?
You must burn!

In the name of hell, henchmen to conspire
Black figures loom as a dark desire
Inquisition served, build your enemy
Tied to the stake, torching heresy
Flame out

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite
In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

You must burn!
You must burn!
You must burn!

// Lux Æterna //

Anticipation
In domination
A sea of hearts beat as one, unified
Magnification
All generations
Approaching thunder awaiting the light

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Exhilaration
Frenzied sensation
Kindred alliance connected inside
Commiseration
Sonic salvation
Cast out the demons that strangle your life

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Lux Æterna

Emancipation
Kill isolation
Never alone for the feelings alike
Amplification
Lightning the nation
Never alive more
Than right here tonight

Full speed or nothing
Full speed or nothing

Lux Æterna
Lux Æterna

Light it

// Crown Of Barbed Wire //

So tight this crown of barbed wire
Its destiny I wear
It splits the skin to the soul
This jagged wreath I bear

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

Fist tight, it stains conviction
Drips down to bloodshot eyes
It crushes down what is real
Deep crimson blots the skies

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight this crown

// Chasing Light //

There's no light

Down and out as darkness falls
So much more than he can take
Shakes the cage in deep withdrawals
Come on, give the boy a break

Oh, he will break
He's no mistake

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

Lost his way through wicked streets
But he is someone's little boy
All the love a young one needs
Thoughtless elders have destroyed

It is destroyed
He's just a boy

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

One step down
Block it all from view
One step down
With apathy, look straight through
One step down
Turn so you won't see
One step down
He's just like you and me

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

There's no light

// If Darkness Had A Son //

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

The beast still shouts for what it's yearning
He stokes the fire, desire burning
The never-ending quenchless craving
The unforgiven misbehaving

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation

So paint your eyes as black as sorrow
Hide yourself behind tomorrow
The nightmares search for infiltration
In domination, captivation

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

Return again to where it's darkest
Dragging home this heathen harvest
And all the children subjugated
Manipulated, propagated

If darkness had a son, here I am
Temptation is his father
If darkness had a son, here I am
I bathe in holy water

If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
If darkness had a son (Here I am)
I bathe in holy water
Temptation, leave me be

// Too Far Gone? //

I, I am desperation
Need it so bad today
I, I am isolation
Static and disarray
Need this, gotta have more
Crawling out my skin
Sickness, scarring returns
Burning me again

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
No

I, I am tribulation
Digging down to the bone
I, I am agitation
Never leaves me alone
Keep on, push it along
Don't want to feel this
Sink in, start to believe
That I don't exist

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
Oh

All away
I am desperation
All away
I am isolation
All away
I am agitation
All away

Too far gone
Never too far gone
I'm never too far gone to save
I can make it through the day

Make it through the day

Just for today

// Room Of Mirrors //

In a mirrored room
All alone I stand
Strip away the phantom fame
Exposing all sides to see
The good and bad in me

In a mirrored room
All alone I stand
Seeing past the flesh and bone
The shame and the fear I hide
Could I show you what's inside?

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Stigmatize my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me free

In a mirrored room
Talking to myself
And the voices pushing back
I'll let them inside my heart
But they'll tear it all apart

In a mirrored room
Just a simple man
Naked, broken, beat, and scarred
What do I really know?
That fear of letting go

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Analyze my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me
Or you might set me free

Would you
Criticize, scrutinize
Ostracize my pain?
Would you
Summarize, patronize
Classify insane?

So I stand here
Before you
You might judge
You might just bury me

Or you might set me
Oh, please won't you set me free

// Inamorata //

Welcome, won't you come inside
Meet the ghosts where I reside
Despite how they're abusing me
Lonely I will never be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burn to get you out of me

Lying, supplying the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinning the web

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Ricochets within my head
Conversations never said
Magnifying every thought
That familiar pain she brought
Seeps inside eventually
Misery loves company
Sullen, I created you
I suppose that I can end you too

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Ooh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for
Oh no

Ooh, misery

She needs me
But I need her more
She loves me
But I love her more
She kills me (She kills me)
But I end this war
She fills me (She fills me)
But she's not what I'm living for

Oh no
Oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Not why I'm living

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Misery
My misery

Misery
My misery

Misery
She's not why I'm living
My misery
She's not why I'm living
Misery
She's not what I'm living for
My misery
No, no
