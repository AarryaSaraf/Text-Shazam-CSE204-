// Do You Hear What I Hear //

Said the night wind to the little lamb
"Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see?

A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite."

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Do you hear what I hear?

A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea."

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
"Do you know what I know?
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know?
Do you know what I know?

A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold."

Said the king to the people everywhere
"Listen to what I say
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people, everywhere
Listen to what I say
Listen to what I say

The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light."

He will bring us goodness and light

// Ever Ever After //

Ever ever after

Storybook endings, fairytales coming true
Deep down inside we wanna believe they still do (Still do)
In our secretest heart, it's our favorite part of the story
Let's just admit we all wanna make it too

Ever ever after
If we just don't get it our own way
Ever ever after
It may only be a wish away

Start a new fashion, wear your heart on your sleeve (Ever after)
Sometimes you reach what's real just by making believe
(By making believe)
Unafraid, unashamed
There is a joy to be claimed in this world
You even might wind up being glad to be you

Ever ever after
Though the world will tell you it's not smart
Ever ever after
The world can be yours if you let your heart
Believe in ever after

No wonder your heart feels it's flying
Your head feels it's spinning
Each happy ending's a brand new beginning
Let yourself be enchanted, you just might break through

To ever ever after
Forever could even start today
Ever ever after
Maybe it's just one wish away
Your ever ever after
Ever ever after
(I've been dreaming of a true love's kiss)

Oh, whoa, whoa
Forever ever after

// Game On //

Everybody's ready for the party
Everywhere coast to coast
Come on we're just getting started
Been waiting all weekday let's go

Gangs all here for the throw down
Rowdy crowd rocking the place
The NFL's beast in a show down
Fired up and ready to play

Game on!
Hey it's Sunday night
Game on!
Hey turn up the light
America's game on NBC
The only place to be
Game on! Game on!
It's Sunday night

Oh America's game on NBC
The only place to be
Game on! Game on!
It's Sunday night
It's Sunday night
It's Sunday night

// God Bless The USA //

If tomorrow all the things were gone you'd worked for all your life
And you had to start again with just your family and your my wife
Would you thank your lucky stars to be livin' here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, and gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

From the lakes of Minnesota, to the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston, from New York to LA
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say

That I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, and gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
God bless the USA

// Hark! The Herald Angels Sing //

Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King;'
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled.'
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph in skies
With angelic host proclaim
'Christ is born in Bethlehem!'

Hark the herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'

Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord:
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail th'incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to dwell
Jesus our Immanuel

Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'

Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'

// Home Sweet Home //

You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song
And you'll never feel
Left all alone

Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this long and winding road

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

You know that I've seen
So many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Falling off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
It keeps me together at the seams

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home

Ooh, I'm on my way
Well, I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Yeah, well, I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

// I'll Stand By You //

Oh why you look so sad
The tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause I've seen the dark side too

When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So if you're mad get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you

When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

Oh I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you

// If I Didn't Love You //

I wouldn't mind being alone
I wouldn't keep checking my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losing sleep
Remembering everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doing lately

You
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (Someone new)
It should be something I can do (I could do)
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in

Yeah, you
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you
(Oh, if I didn't love you)

It wouldn't be so hard to see you
Know how much I need you
Wouldn't hate that I still feel like I do

If I didn't love you
(Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you
(Mmm)

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely getting by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the "want you" off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
(Yeah)
If I didn't love you
(Oh, if I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you
(If I didn't love you)
If I didn't love you

// Independence Day //

Well she seemed alright by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy left the proof on her cheek
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day

Well word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
She knew she was on the losing end
Some folks whispered,some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no was about
On Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day

Well she lit up the sky the 4th of July
By the time that the fireman had come
They just put out the flames and took down some names
To send me to the county home
Now I ain't saying it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day

Let freedom ring
Let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong
Let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away
Let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day
Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day

// Keep Us Safe //

Deserts grow cold
Rivers run dry
We give up on each other without thinking twice
Hope gets lost
Can't see the dawn
When the storm just won't let up, give us the faith to carry on
When we get scared
Let this be our prayer

God keep us safe, safe tonight
Keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe

We walk a thousand steps in the wrong direction
Broken and bruised, wearing tattered shoes
Asking Him a thousand questions
But we go on trying to get back home
And through the struggles and the troubles I know we don't walk alone
Even when we get lost through the valleys we crossed

God keep us safe, safe tonight
And keep our eyes toward the skies
Send down an army of angels
To make us brave
And keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
God keep us safe

Oh God keep us safe, unafraid
And keep our eyes on the heavens and give us grace
Send us an army of angels
To make us brave
Keep us strong and unafraid
Keep us strong and unafraid
God keep us safe
And keep us safe

// Little Toy Guns //

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Toy guns
Ohh, I wish they didn't cut like a knife (Like a knife)
I wish they didn't break you inside (Break you inside)
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

Toy guns
Oh, like little toy guns

// Only Us //

I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good
I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noise that's in your head
We can't compete with all that

So what if it's us, what if it's us
And only us?
And what came before won't count anymore, or matter
Can we try that?
What if it's you, what if it's me, what if that's all that we needed to be?
And the rest of the world flies away
What do you say?

I ain't never thought there'll be someone like you who would want me
So I'll give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer than you could possibly know

So it can be us, it can be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore, or matter
We can try that
It's not so impossible
Nobody else but the two of us here
'Cause you're saying it's possible
We can just watch the whole world disappear
'Til you're the only one I still know how to see

It's just you and me
It'll be us, it'll be us and only us
And what came before won't count anymore
We can try that, you and me
That's all that we needed to be
And the rest of the world falls away
And the rest of the world falls away
The world falls away, the world falls away
And it's only us

// Out Of That Truck //

Yeah, I bet that shotgun headrest still smells like my shampoo
That messed up tape deck's still stuck playing that mix I made for you
Yeah, that's my strawberry wine stain
My nail polish on the tailgate
So much of me left I bet you must get déja vu

When you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy
I bet it drives you crazy
Thinking about us on every
Other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat
Trying to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck
So good luck
Trying to get me out of that truck

So go on touch that paint up where I scratched the driver's side
That won't take back all our weekend for no reason rides
Yeah, I bet the left side of the flatbed
Will always be mine in your head
Even though it's not me counting stars with you tonight

When you're running around in that stick shift Chevy
I bet it drives you crazy
Thinking about us on every
Other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat
Trying to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck
So good luck
Trying to get me out of that truck, yeah

Ooh, you can shine it up, you can clean it out
Spin those tires all over town
When the music's up and the window's down
I'm the one you're thinkin' 'bout

My Silverado silhouette
Still shotgun riding in your head

So when you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy
I bet it drives you crazy
Thinking about us on every
Other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat
Trying to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck
So good luck
Trying to get me out of that truck
Mmm

My Silverado silhouette
Still shotgun riding in your head

// Praying For Time //

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now

These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we'll take our chances
'Cause God stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
And turned his back
And all God's children
Crept out the back door
And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging onto hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
Oh maybe we should all be praying for time

This is the year of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year

These are the days of the guilty man
The television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there
Is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances cause God stopped keeping score
And you'll cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children
To come back for

And it's hard to love when there's so much to hate
And hanging onto hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Mm, well maybe we should all be praying for time

// Something Bad //

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

[Miranda:]
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Carrie:]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window, where you heading to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out the mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen…

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

[Carrie:]
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Miranda:]
'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

// Something In The Water //

He said, "I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave me

Then somebody said what I'm saying to you
Opened my eyes and told me the truth."
They said, "Just a little faith, it'll all get better."
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh, there must've been something in the water

Well, I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hope and all out of fight

Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying, "God, if you're there come and rescue me."
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh, there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing along to "Amazing Grace"
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty, I saw the light
Gonna look ahead, no turning back
Live every day, give it all that I have
Trust in someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed
And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water (amazing grace)
Oh, there must be something in the water (how sweet the sound)
Oh, there must be something in the water (that saved a wretch)
Oh, there must be something in the water (like me)
Oh, yeah

I am changed (I once was lost)
Stronger (but now I'm found)
(Was blind but now I see)

// Stretchy Pants //

Time to celebrate the season, haven't eaten all day
My tummy is growling 'cause I've been saving up space
I've got my place at the table, can't fit no more on my plate
I've got my fork in my hand ready to stuff my face

So bring on the turkey, potatoes, casserole dishes
'Cause I ain't messing around with them buttoned up britches
You got them skinny jeans on, girl, I feel sorry for you
'Cause I just tried everything, and I'm going back for round 2

I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)
Spandex and Lycra, you better work it for me
'Cause I'm about to expand this band of elasticity
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)

Ask me where I got 'em, Amazon at my door
And if I wear this pair out, I'm gonna buy me some more
I got leftovers waiting in the fridge for repeating
Give me a nap and an hour, you know they gonna get eaten

So bring on the turkey, potatoes, casserole dishes
'Cause I ain't messing around with them buttoned up britches
Can't get my skinny jeans on, but don't feel sorry for me
'Cause I just tried everything, and I'm going back for round 3

I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)
Hey, Spandex and Lycra, you better work it for me
'Cause I'm about to expand this band of elasticity
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)

Fruitcake, I'll try it
Ambrosia, I'll try it
Aunt Bertha's 'nana pudding with a cherry on top
Cookies, I'll have some
Oh Gingerbread, leave no crumbs
Guzzle down some egg nog, even though I'm 'bout to pop

I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)

So bring on the turkey, potatoes, casserole dishes
'Cause I ain't messing around with them buttoned up britches
And when you think that I'm done, and I'm laid out on the floor
No no no don't let me fool ya, I got some room for some more

With my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
I got my stretchy pants on (stretchy, stretchy)
Oh oh oh...my stretchy pants on (stretchy pants)
Mmm I got my stretchy pants on ya'll (stretchy, stretchy)

Santa ain't got nothing on me

// Tears Of Gold //

I hear them fallin' a thousand miles away
Nothing and no one is safe, from her eyes
And then when they hit the ground
Then our whole world starts to shake
I'm drownin' inside of the pain
The end of you and I

Pero si tú te vas
Mi vida no es vida si tú no estás
Mi último aliento te llevarás
Si tú no estás será imposible continuar

'Cause when they fall from your eyes they'll be beautiful
It's the sweetest goodbye that I'll ever know
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
Tears of gold
Like I'm watchin' the sun explode
I can feel every drop when I watch you go
'Cause it's rainin' (It's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' (It's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' (Cause it's rainin')
Tears of gold
'Cause when they fall from your eyes they'll be beautiful
It's the sweetest goodbye that I'll ever know

Falling around us, colliding where they land
Paintin' our shadows in sin
We've done all we can

Pero si tú te vas
Mi vida no es vida si tú no estás
Mi último aliento te llevarás
Si tú no estás será imposible continuar

'Cause when they fall from your eyes they'll be beautiful
It's the sweetest goodbye that I'll ever know
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' (It's rainin')
Tears of gold
Like I'm watchin' the sun explode
I can feel every drop when I watch you go
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
Tears of gold
Fall from your eyes they'll be beautiful
It's the sweetest goodbye that I'll ever know
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
'Cause it's rainin' ('Cause it's rainin')
Tears of gold
Like I'm watchin' the sun explode (Ah-ah-ah)
I can feel every drop when I watch you go (Ah-ah-ah)
'Cause it's rainin' (Oh-oh-oh, it's raining)
'Cause it's rainin' (Oh-oh-oh, it's raining)
'Cause it's rainin' (Oh-oh-oh, it's raining)
Tears of gold

// The First Noel //

The First Noel the Angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and earth of naught
And with His blood mankind hath bought
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel!

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King
Born is the King
Born is the King of Israel!

// The Moment Of Truth //

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When you're alone, you ask yourself, what are you searching for?
Deep in the night, a dream is born, one that you can't ignore
If you think you can find the passion and you're ready to take a chance
If you really believe you can make it, then the power is in your own hands

It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now
Oh

Once in your life, you make a choice, ready to risk it all
Deep in your soul, you hear a voice answering to the call
Though you know that it won't be easy, it's a promise you'll make for love
For the people that keep believing and the one that you're thinking of

It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now
It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, nothing can stop you now
Let's go, All Valley
It's the moment of truth, you're giving it all
Standing alone, willing to fall
If you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are
It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line
This is the place, this is the time
You've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now

// There's A Place For Us //

There's a place out there for us
More than just a prayer or anything you've ever dreamed of
So when you feel like giving up
Cause you don't fit in down here
Fear is crashing in, close your eyes and take my hand yeah

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us, there's a place for us

When the water meets the sky
Where your heart is free and hope comes back to life
When these broken hands are whole again
We'll find what we've been waiting for
We were made for so much more

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us, there's a place for us

So hold on, hold on
There's a place for us

We can be the kings and queens of anything if we believe
It's written in the stars that shine above
A world where you and I belong
Where faith and love will keep us strong
Exactly who we are is just enough
Exactly who we are is just enough
There's a place for us

// What Child Is This? //

What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant king to own Him
The King of kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the song on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby:
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary!
