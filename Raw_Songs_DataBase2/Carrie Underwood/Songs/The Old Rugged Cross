On a hill far away, stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
For 'twas on that old cross, Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Ooh...
Yeah...

Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'Til my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown
