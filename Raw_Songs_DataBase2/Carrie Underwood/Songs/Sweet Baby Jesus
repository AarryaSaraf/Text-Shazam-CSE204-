I wonder were you cold that night
Lying there by Mary's side
Taking your first breath
I wonder were you scared to death

Fully human, fully God
Full of wonder and the blood
That one day you would shed to save the world
Tiny feet and tiny hands
With all the earth at their command
It must have felt strange to you

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
So far from home
You could have left us
Helpless and so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

The first time Mary held you close
All wrapped up in tattered clothes
Did you see tears fall from her eyes
Just a mother holding her first child

Fully human, fully God
Full of wonder and the blood
That one day you would shed to save the world
Tiny feet and tiny hands
With all the earth at their command
Oh, it must have been strange to you

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
So far from home
Oh, you could have left us
Helpless and so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

Sweet Baby Jesus
Come down to love us
To lie in a manger
To die on a cross
Oh, you could have left us
Helpless and so, so lost
But you chose to save us
Sweet Baby Jesus

Sweet Baby Jesus
