While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I'm special
Cover me with sweetness
'Cause a time will come
When we're not so young, and beautiful
While we're young and beautiful
Living free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancin' in our bare feet
'Cause when the summer's done
We might not be so young, and beautiful

It's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
We'll party down on Main street
Wearing next to nothing
Feelin' every heart beat
Havin' fun, while we're still young and beautiful

Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful

Beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful
Oh, beautiful
Beautiful
Young and beautiful

Oh, it's a crazy ride
And baby, you and I
Are keeping our sweet love alive
Tonight, while we're young and beautiful
Oh, so beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
Cover me with sweetness
While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it, like you mean it
Like you mean it, like you mean it, like you do
Oh, yeah
Oh, so beautiful
