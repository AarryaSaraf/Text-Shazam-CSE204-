I was sittin' on my doorstep
I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand
But I knew I had to do it
And he wouldn't understand
So hard to see myself without him
I felt a piece of my heart break
But when you're standin' at a crossroad
There's a choice you gotta make

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

I know there's a blue horizon
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me
Getting there means leavin' things behind
Sometimes life's so bittersweet

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye

Time heals
The wounds that you feel
Somehow, right now

I guess it's gonna have to hurt
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
I guess it's gonna break me down
Like falling when you try to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life
Starts with goodbye
I guess I'm gonna have to cry
And let go of some things I've loved to get to the other side
Starts with goodbye
Like falling when you're trying to fly
It's sad, but sometimes movin' on with the rest of your life (Yeah)
Starts with goodbye

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Yeah
