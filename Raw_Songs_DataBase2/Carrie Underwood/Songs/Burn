Sitting there wrapped up tight
In your flannel button-up
With your arms around me
Watching those flames dance high
Where nobody could find us
Oh, but you sure found me
Yeah, we were lighting that fire
Heating up the sky like a July rocket
No, we never got tired
We'd stay up all night and watch it

Burn
Like whiskey in my glass
Even though it's sitting on ice
It's always gonna burn
Little too hot real fast
Like when you were mine, yeah
That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Every time I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn

Riding 'round rag top down
Little beach town
Weekend on the water
Under that gold moonshine
Your lips on mine
Couldn't get no hotter
Yeah, we were soaking it up
Buzzing on love and margaritas
When I see the sand and the sun
The salt in the air, I swear, I feel the

Burn
Like whiskey in my glass
Even though it's sitting on ice
It's always gonna burn
Little too hot real fast
Like when you were mine, yeah
That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Every time I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn, yeah

It's always gonna burn, just like this whiskey
It's always gonna burn and make me wonder if you miss me

That's the thing about your memory
It's keeping me warm, but it's killing me
Baby when I think about you now
Even though our love died out
It's always gonna burn, burn, burn

It's always gonna burn, burn, burn
