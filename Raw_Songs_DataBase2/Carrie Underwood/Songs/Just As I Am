Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fighting and fears within, without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Oh Lamb of God I come
