Everybody's ready for the party
Everywhere coast to coast
Come on we're just getting started
Been waiting all weekday let's go

Gangs all here for the throw down
Rowdy crowd rocking the place
The NFL's beast in a show down
Fired up and ready to play

Game on!
Hey it's Sunday night
Game on!
Hey turn up the light
America's game on NBC
The only place to be
Game on! Game on!
It's Sunday night

Oh America's game on NBC
The only place to be
Game on! Game on!
It's Sunday night
It's Sunday night
It's Sunday night
