Love song, dancing in the living room
Like the whole world's spinning 'round for me and you
We got red wine, pouring for a party for two
Just getting lost in the night

You know I love it when you play your guitar
When you promise me the moon, sitting under the stars
I only want to be wherever you are
'Cause whenever I look in your eyes

You make my heart beat faster
You make my heart beat faster
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

So tell me everything here in the dark
What makes you smile, what gets you falling apart
We can lay here 'till the morning comes
Hide from the sun, just keep on coming undone

You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

Oh
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart beat faster (You make my, you make my heart)
You make my heart speed when we're close
So baby, hold me, kiss me slowly
And make my heart beat faster

Ooh, yeah
You make my, you make my heart beat
