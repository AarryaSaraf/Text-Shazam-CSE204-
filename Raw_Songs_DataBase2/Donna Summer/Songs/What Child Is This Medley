What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

(Do you) hear what I hear 
(Do you) hear what I hear 
(Do you) hear what I hear 
(Do you) hear what I hear 
(Do you) hear what I hear 
(Do you) hear what I hear 


Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty King
"So you know what I know?
In your palace warm mighty King
Do you know what I know?
The child the child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light"

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world...

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Somebody gotta tell ya)

Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary...
