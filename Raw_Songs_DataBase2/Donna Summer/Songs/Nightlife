Debra waitin' on the corner
Flarin' smile and darin' style
Big "G" cruising, neon flashin'
Lost and found
Tinsel town

Day time orphans join the circus
Climb the rope and walk
The wire
To feel the night and the
Music playing
Feed the fire
To feed the fire

Night life, only living for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life

Couples coasting, singles
Searching
Loners lost among the crowd
Action turning on reaction
Lose up
Fool around

Pretzel vendor, first class
Spender
Limousine and ketchup dream
Pinball hall and roulette roller
Every scene
For everything

Night life, only livin' for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life
Night life, only livin' for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life

Night life, night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life
Night life,
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life
