O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels!

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing Alleluia
All ye choir of angels;
O sing all ye blissful ones of heav'n above

In the highest glory!
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning;
Jesus to thee be glory giv'n;
Words of the father
Now in the flesh appearing

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord
