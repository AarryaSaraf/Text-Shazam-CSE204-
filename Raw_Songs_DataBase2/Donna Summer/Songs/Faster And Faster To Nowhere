Where am I going? What is the place?
Somebody help me outta here.

Oh I'm walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere
Oh I'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere
'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare
No matter which way-mare


Seems that there must be some way to get out.
But I just can't find it.

People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future
Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to
Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys
Where no one should dare go
So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere


I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun
The city closing in

Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little

Children crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them
It's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them
'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare
No matter which way-mare


Help me, I wanna get out.
Cut it out! Stop closing in on me HELP!!!

Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere
We're gonna take a little
