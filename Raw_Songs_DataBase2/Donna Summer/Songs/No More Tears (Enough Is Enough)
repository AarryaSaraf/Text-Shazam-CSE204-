It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears
After all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill
Get the check pay the bill
You can do it

Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

If you've reached the end
Don't pretend that it's right
When it's over (It's over)
If the feeling is gone
Don't think twice just move on
Get it over (over, over)
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough, is enough, is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough, is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it

I always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister, goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough is enough is enough is ENOUGH!!!
