Home for eternity
I believe I miss each and every face
Come on and play some music
Turn on every love light in this place
I've got to find myself
Totally surrounded in loves circles of all my friends

Please, celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
That I can recall whenever I find myself so all alone
(Take me home)

Life's uneasy highway
Blowin' where the western winds won't blow
Somebody tried to tell me but they forgot to tell me why
I got to come on home, come on home, come on home
Be what you want from me
I'll be strong, I'll be here

Please, celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, don't be sorry I will never remember
That I can recall the moment I
I left myself so all alone
Never remember when I have gone
But I'll tell you that now
On my grave I belong - take me home
Celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, don't be sorry I...

Now, Donna, don't be sorry I'm gone
Just remember that where I am
There's no tears, no pain, no pain, no, no more sorrows!
Please, celebrate me home, ah, ah, ah
Please, celebrate me home, oh, oh
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
(The fathers here...)
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, ah, the fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
I'm finally here, I'm never alone
So celebrate me home
Please, celebrate me home (celebrate me...)
So glad I made it home - thank you Jesus!
