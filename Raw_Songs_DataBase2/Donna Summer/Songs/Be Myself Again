Let me introduce myself
I'm a woman that you've never seen
You might know me from somewhere else
As someone that I've never been

I gave everything to play the game
My soul fell apart at the seems
I fell down like a house of cards
When somebody pulled the Queen

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again

You must believe me when I say
Don't live someone else's desire
Turn it around like a photograph
The writing's been there all the time

Now you can have all these hopes and dreams
The ones I can't use anymore
I don't know what it is you lost
But I hope you got what you came for

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again

Sometimes I wanna leave right now
Sometimes I wanna cry out loud
I wanna let it all hang out
But I don't wanna let you down

Sometimes I wanna just lay here
Sometimes I wanna disappear
I wanna show you all my fear
But I don't wanna let you down

'Cause you could spend your life
Looking for your own reflection
Time can blur the lines
Between what's real and what's projected

Had I known what I lost,
What I'd gained
What it cost
I'd still give what remains
To be myself again
To be myself again...
