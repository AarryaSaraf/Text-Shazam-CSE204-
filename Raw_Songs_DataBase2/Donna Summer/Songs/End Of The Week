I get out of work
And then I throw away all of my cares
I get out of work
And then I wash the week out my hair

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
It's hard as could be
But by old Friday evening
We're free, we're free, we're free

End of the week
The weekend started
Been working so hard to play
End of the week
It's time to party
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

You're tasting freedom
No one to push you around
End of the week
And life has a reason
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

Street are alive
You know everybody's going somewhere
You put on the slide
You gotta beat the crowd just everywhere

And all the music all the dancing
Get you so high
And all that sweet romancing
Oh my, oh my, oh my

End of the week
The weekend started
Working so hard to play
End of the week
It's time to party
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

Feels good now
Feels good now
End of the week
End of the week

It's real good now
Real good now
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week
