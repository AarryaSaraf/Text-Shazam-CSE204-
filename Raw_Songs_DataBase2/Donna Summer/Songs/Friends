In our childhoods days
Together we would play
People said we were inseparable

Like a brother then
My protective friend
He would always take good care of me

Friends that's what we are just
Friends no more or less oh
Here we are sharing so much fun
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

Years have come and gone
Still our friendship's strong
Now he's more than just the boy next door

I'm in love with him
Guess I've always been
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for

Friends that's all we are just
Friends so near yet so far from love
And oh the joy that he can bring
Friends why can't he see that I want him
To be more than my friend

I'd like to tell him that I need him bad
But I'm afraid if I do I might lose
The only friend that I have

Friends that's all we are just
Friends so near yet so far from love and thus
We'll always remain friends
Friends why can't he see that I want us
To be more than just friends
