Well, I told ya not to fall in love
I ain't the kind you can tie down
You went and did it anyway
As though I'd done ya harm
And each time I went reaching out
That's when you let go
Now don't try and pretend
That you didn't know

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on, baby, set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Butterflies were made to fly
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
Oh yeah, yeah
Ooh, don't hold me, no, no

Well, I told you right from the beginning
I couldn't stay for love
I had to go
Now it's not because in my heart
Baby, I don't love you
It's just because I'm meant to be
I'm meant to be free

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on, baby, set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Butterflies were made to fly
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
Oh, don't hold me
Don't hold me, no, no

'Cause it's not because in my heart
Baby, I don't love you
It's only that I'm meant to be
I'm meant to be free

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on now and set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on now and set me free
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
