If people talk then let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk gossiping past
Stabbing their words with all of their stares in our back
Let the people talk

If people talk grapevine of lies
Spinning their yarns
Spreading the seeds of our harm

People talk but we know the truth let them all talk
Baby it's still me and you

We'll face the fears and when the rumours blow
All the names they call will never hurt
Sticks and stones may break all of our bones
But all the King's men will put us together again

People talk so let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk

People talk so let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk grapevine of lies
Spinning their yarns
Spreading the seeds of our harm
