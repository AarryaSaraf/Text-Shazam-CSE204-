This love of ours is gradually fading
Something is wrong, or somebody's faking

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Too many nights sitting here waiting
Too many days hoping and praying

Something inside seems to be dying
Most of the time I just feel like crying

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Oh yes we can, sure we can
Sure we can, sure we can

Autumn changes
Shifting phases
Autumn changes
Turning stages
Surely something can help to patch it up

Oh, yes we can, sure we can
Sure we can, sure we can
