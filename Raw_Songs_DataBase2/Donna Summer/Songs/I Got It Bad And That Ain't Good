Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)


Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?
And how about you?
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!

My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good


So you see on Monday nights
I just go out and drink and drink

But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
Cryin' my heart out
Lord above me (come on) make him love me
Then he should
I got it bad baby
I got it bad baby
I got it bad and that ain't good!
No it ain't good at all you know


But listen Mister big shot I've got your number
And I'll take care of you
And you too and you and  you and you
