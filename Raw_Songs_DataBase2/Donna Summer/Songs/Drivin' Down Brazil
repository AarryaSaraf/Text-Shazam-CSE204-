Tudo bem Tudo bem Tudo bom bom
Heat grows in his mind, hits the steering wheel to tryin' tune the radio out loud
He heard Jobim say, and his heart began to sway
He didn't think of anything but his baby
He was drivin' keep on drivin' he kept drivin' down brazil
He feels batucada he dances the samba
If only in his head


He was drivin' down brazil
All pimped up and dressed to kill
A thousand single dollar bills
In his low ride Bonneville
He was drivin' down brazil
He was drivin' down brazil
And he gave the girls a thrill
In his low ride bonneville
He's the king king of the hill
He was drivin down brazil

Shhh shut up and get your baby
Please comma comma get your baby
Please comma comma get your baby, shes waiting
He cruised up to the light, she jumps in by his side
They kiss and wave goodbye oh
They had so much to say, but the groove began to play
He couldn't think of anything but his baby
He was drivin' keep on drivin' he kept drivin' down brazil
He dreams of Amanda while he sips guarana, in his mind she's dressed in red
If anything



Comma comma comma get your baby 
Tudo bem Tudo bem Tudo bom bom 

He feels batucada he dances the samba
If only in his head
Makes me crazy



Just have to comma get your baby
Just have to comma get your baby
Just have to comma get your baby
She's waiting
