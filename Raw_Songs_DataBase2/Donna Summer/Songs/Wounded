Well there's a whole lot of hurting being going on
Well I've been wounded, wounded, wounded
This ain't no way to be carrying on
You see me wounded, wounded, wounded

I'm taken like a stone
That you've thrown in the deep blue sea
Giving me the scars that will never heal
Wounded, wounded, wounded

I remember the day when you came up to me
Almost breaking on your knees
Said you needed me more than anything else
You really took me in

But it'd make you feel good to know
I'd do anything you say
Well forget that line 'cause I ain't gonna play
Wounded, wounded, wounded

I remember the day when you came up to me
Almost breaking on your knees
Said you needed me more than anything else
You really took me in

But it'd make you feel good to know
I'd do anything you say
Well forget that line 'cause I ain't gonna play
Wounded, wounded, wounded
