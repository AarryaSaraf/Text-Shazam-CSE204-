// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listens
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dresses up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times many ways
"Merry Christmas"

Every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times many ways
"Merry Christmas"
"Merry Christmas"
"Merry Christmas to you..."

// O Come All Ye Faithful //

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels!

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him

In the highest glory!

Christ the Lord

Yea Lord we greet thee
Born this happy morning;

Words of the father
Now in the flesh appearing

O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him
Christ the Lord

// Christmas Is Here //

Christmas is here
Snowflakes filling the air
People rushing past every display

No time for napping
There's buying and then wrapping
The gifts to be given away

Sparkling lights
All the dazzling sights
Christmas trees loaded with joy

Hearts full of giving
Children are living
For what could be their favorite toy

Christmas is here

Christmas is here
It's a wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here
Christmas is here
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year

Families together
No matter the weather
Feasting and fun is the goal

Grandma is making
Sugar cookies are baking
To warm up the body and soul

Full decoration
In anticipation of times
Marked with laughter and cheer
And day long awaited
And much celebrated
Christmas is finally here

Christmas is here
It's a wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here
Christmas is here
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year

A festive occasion
A welcome invasion
Of carolers filling the air
Song of rejoicing
And everyone voicing
A story of hope we all share

Christmas is here

Christmas is here
It's wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here
Christmas is here
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year
Christmas is here
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful time of the year

Christmas is finally here

// What Child Is This Medley //

[What Child Is This / Do You Hear What I Hear / Joy To The World]

What child is this who laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary

(Do you) hear what I hear [6x]

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
"Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song a song high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty King
"So you know what I know?
In your palace warm mighty King
Do you know what I know?
The child the child sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light"

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world...

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare him room
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing

(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Do you) hear what I hear?
Joy to the world
(Somebody gotta tell ya)

Haste, haste to bring him laud
The babe the son of Mary...

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place that I love
Even more than I usually do

And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow
And mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
And I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Please have snow
And mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
And I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

// Christmas Spirit //

Everyone, come gather near,
And I'll tell you a story, that you'll love to hear,
(ooohh)
It's Christmas time, the season's RIPE
And all around the world, we celebrate the birth of Christ.

He came to bring us peace,
He came to bring us everything that we need to set us free.
HOW I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Oh I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart

As a child I still recall
Well, Christmas was my favorite season of them all
(oh) my heart was filled with childlike grace
And THE hope there is in knowing
Why the savior came

He came to bring us peace
He came to bring us everything that we need
To set us free
Now I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Yes I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart

So turn your heart throbs in
And let God grow within
Not to destroy
The greatest gift I know
He came to earth below
To show us love

He came to bring us peace
He came to bring us joy
He came to bring us everything

IN faith, if we believe
The gift that we receive
Is life and love and everything

The greatest gift I know
He came to earth below
He came to bring us everything

Still I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Yes I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Now I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart

// Breath Of Heaven //

[Spoken:]
And Gabriel appeared to Mary and said
"Do not be afraid Mary
You have found favor with God
You will be with child
And give birth to a son
And You are to give him the name Jesus
He will be great
And will be called the son of the most high
And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
And he will reign over the house of David forever
His kingdom will never end"

I have traveled many moonless night
Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy father You have come
And chosen me now to carry Your son

I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For Your are holy
Breath of heaven

Do You wonder as You watch my face
If a wiser one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of Your plan
Help me strong
Help me be
Help me

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For You are holy

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven

// O Holy Night //

Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pruning
Till he appear'd and the soul felts its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Halleluiah for the holy night

// Lamb Of God //

[Spoken:]
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea
During the time of King Herod
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked
"where is the one who is born King of the Jews?
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him"

Lord we have traveled far
Torn and weary guided by your star
There before us the living King
Halleluiah his praises sing

Herod with a evil plan
Kill the babies
Came his bold command
He tried to alter God's holy plan
God has saved him
The son of man

Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of God
The chosen one of God
Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of love
The chosen one of God

Three Kings from a distance come
Bearing gifts for the only one
Shout to heaven sound the drum
Tell the nations
The Lord has come

Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of God
The chosen one of God
Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of love
The chosen one of God

He came to bring us his peace
He came to bring us his joy
To bring us love

Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of God
The chosen one of God

Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of God
The precious lamb of God

Behold the lamb of God
The mighty King of God
The chosen one of God

[Spoken:]
And so the wise men the shepherds
The ox and the lamb
The angels above
All rejoiced at God's command
As a star shine from heaven
This new King to adorn
On that very first Christmas
When Jesus Christ was born
