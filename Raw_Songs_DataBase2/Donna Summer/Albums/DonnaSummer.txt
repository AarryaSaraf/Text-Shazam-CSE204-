// Love Is In Control //

Hung around with big shots
Never knew love was in the sights
I guess I missed the target
Caught up in a different line of fire
But I know since I've been aiming
For the sweetness in your soul
Your name is on the bullet
And it's gettin' ready to explode
There's be a change inside my life
(And just wanna let you know)

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control, whooo
I've got my finger on the trigger
Ah, yeah
I ain't lettin' go

Mama used to tell me
Girl, you better load your gun up right
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'
Hit it with your best shot every time
Well I didn't understand her
'Til you walked right into range
I saw your love at twenty paces
And I knew I'd won the game
You better raise your heart up high
(Or love will blow you right away)

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control, whooo
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go, whoooo
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go

Leave off the safety catch
There ain't no risk
We're gonna have some fun, whoooo
I've got cha, love's begun
So stay with me
Until the mornin' sun, whooo
(You're superbullet number one)

[Instrumental Interlude]

There's been a change inside my life
(And I just wanna let you know)

I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go
I've got my finger on the trigger
Love is in control
I've got my finger on the trigger
I ain't lettin' go...

// Mystery Of Love //

Seasons are changing
Children of love are alive
People reach out to survive
Together

Love is the message
We carry across the sky
Down through the passage of
Time forever

History unfolds
As this story's told

(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Coming to rescue
Rescue me

A man and a woman
Lost in each other's embrace
Star-crossed in time in a place
Far away
Innocent dreamers
Turning the wheels of chance
Searching to find romance
Forever

We will surely find
Love is for all time

(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key
Down through the history
Of love
Time is the one that holds
The answer
(and it's) the mystery of love
Oh, will it set me free

For all time

(And it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key
Down through the history
Of love
Time is the one that holds
The answer
(and it's) the mystery of love
How we go on and on forever
(and it's) the mystery of love
Only one heart can turn the key...

// The Woman In Me //

[Spoken:]
You know baby
I'm so happy to be here you and I
And I just wanna let you know
That I'd follow you to the end of the world
And let you know that I care
And I want you to know that
If you need me I'll always be there

Dancin' close feelin' restless
It's a slow, sultry night
It'll be a lifetime 'til sunrise
If you don't stay with me tonight

(I) feel your breath caress my shoulder
As your heart reads my mind
You don't have to tell me anything
I can see everything
In your eyes

It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me

Baby there's so much
No man has ever touched
Of the woman in me

[Spoken:]
I love you baby oh...

I might be tremblin' but I'm no scared
(it's) just my desire, breaking free
I've never had a change like this before
To unlock all the doors
To the woman in me

It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me

Baby there's so much
No man has ever touched
Of the woman of me

Like the dark side of the full moon
(I've) never shown, what I'm
Showing to you

It's so easy with you
I don't need a excuse
To be the woman in me
It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me
It's so easy with you
To be the woman in me
It's so easy with you
To be the woman in me
It's so easy with you
To be the woman in me

// State Of Independence //

State of life, may I live, may I love
Coming out the sky, I name me a name
Coming out silver word for what it is
It is very nature of the sound, the game

Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida

Siamese, Indonese, to Tibet treat the life
As a game, if you please (hey)
Coming up Caribee such a freedom
Derives from a meditative state
Movin' on, believe that's it, call it magic
Third world, it is, I only guessed it

Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida
Shablamidi, shablamida

Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida
Shablimidi, shablamida

Shot to the soul the flame of Oroladian
(the) essence of the word
The state of independence

Sounds like a signal from you
Bring me to meet your sound
And I will bring you to my heart

Love, like a signal you call
Touching my body, my soul
Bring to me, you to meet me here

Home, be the temple of your heart
Home, be the body of your love
Just like holy water to my lips
(hey, hey)

Yes, I do know how I survive
Yes, I do know why I'm alive
To love and be with you
Day by day by day by day

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all in His wisdom hear

His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be

Say, yeah -e-yay, yeah-e-yo
Yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo...
Be the sound of higher
Love today
Yeah-e-yeah (hey, hey)

Time, time again, it is said
We will hear, we will see
See it all in His wisdom hear

His truth will abound the land
This truth will abound the land
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be
This state of independence shall be...

// Livin' In America //

Straight outta school but still just a fool
Thought the streets were paved with gold
He moved off the block and
Found he was lost
In a world he'd never known
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent
Played all the aces and wound up president
You see it's okay
Got to find your own way
Keep on trying all day
And you know your time will come
You'll get your chance to run

You're livin' in  America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

Soap opera child with hope in her eyes
Lookin' for a starrin' role
She came into town and acted the clown
Had a long, long way to go
Waitin' on tables and pumpin' gasoline
She served and agent,
Now she's a movie queen
You see it's okay
Got to find your own way
Keep on tryin' all day
And you know the time will come
For each and everyone

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

You'll stand alone on a long hard road
With a crowd that you can't see
Just start by steppin' out
Then let your mind run free

You're livin' in America
You're livin' in the home of the dream
You're livin' in America
Just make it what you want it to be

It's okay
You're livin' in the USA
Find your dream
You know that dream can set
You free

It's okay
We're part of the United State
You and me
Can be just what we wanna be
He's okay
He left the block and reached
The top
She's all right
The agent put her name in lights

He's okay
He's paid his rent he's president
She's all right
She's on your TV screen tonight

// Protection //

Night after night
I keep holding on
You say you love me
Then you leave me so lonely

Baby, I don't believe a word
You're sayin'
I think it's all some evil game
You're playin'

Still all day long all I do is think
About ya
You got me believin' that I can't
Live without ya
Well if ya want it, well here is
My confession
Baby, I can't help it, you're my obsession

Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love

I wait at home by my telephone
When I call your house, baby
You're not home
Knock on the door and rush
Down the stairs
When I open up, baby you're
Not there

When we're together and ya put
Your arms around me
Your love sweeps away all the
Confusion that surrounds me

You keep my mind
Forever, ever in doubt
You want me believin'
That baby, I can't live without

Protection that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from  your love

We stand alone, at my window
And stare out, at the shadows
Down below
I feel your fingers on my face
I want to stay, I want to run away

Protection that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love
Protection, that's what I need
I need protection, baby from your love...

// (If It) Hurts Just A Little //

Perfect love you will never find
Say goodbye to what's left
Behind
Your release is way overdue
Let your tears be a friend to you

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If it hurts just a little be glad of it
If you try you will see, what will be
Hurts just a little

Silent eyes make your public life
And the lies can be cold as ice
How could you ever be so blind
Bet you never ever ever thought
That love could be so kind

If it hurts just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If it hurts just a little be glad of it
If you try you will see, what will be
Hurts just a little

C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')
C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')
C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')
It's a crime of passion
That's just what it means to me

If it hurt just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If it hurts just a little be glad of it
If you try you will see
If it hurt just a little be glad of it
Don't get caught in the middle
Thinking 'bout it
If hurts just a little be glad of it
If you try you will see

C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')
C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')
C'mon baby, c'mon sugar, c'mon
Honey (darlin')...

// Love Is Just A Breath Away //

Deep in the night, when you're
Away from me
I'm reachin' out just to touch you
In my dreams
Countin' the hours 'till you'll be
Here again
So hard to wait, got to have you
Close to me
'cause baby

You, turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a
Breath away

Somethin' inside has taken
Over me
So baby, can't you see you
Captured my heart
I can't disguise the things you
Make me feel
I should have known this was
Magic right from the start

'Cause baby, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away
We, we don't have a word to say
Our hearts can speak a thousand ways
When love is just a breath away

Take me, take me into paradise
Show me
All the love that's in your eyes
Light up my life

You, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away
We, we don't have a word to say
Our heart can speak a thousand ways
When love is just a breath away
You, you turn my nights to day
When your love, love is just a breath away

// Lush Life //

I used to visit the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis
Of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

All the men I knew had sad and
Sullen gray faces
With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your
Siren song
To tempt me to madness
I knew all the while
That your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness of a
Great love for me
Oh, yes I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Now life is lonely again
And only last year everything
Seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A troughful of hearts would only
Be a bore
A week in Paris will ease the bite
Of it
But all I really care
Is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you
I will and yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush, stifling those
Who strive
I'll live a lush life in some
Small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are
Lonely too

// Sometimes Like Butterflies //

Well, I told ya not to fall in love
I ain't the kind you can tie down
You went and did it anyway
As though I'd done ya harm
And each time I went reaching out
That's when you let go
Now don't try and pretend
That you didn't know

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on, baby, set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Butterflies were made to fly
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
Oh yeah, yeah
Ooh, don't hold me, no, no

Well, I told you right from the beginning
I couldn't stay for love
I had to go
Now it's not because in my heart
Baby, I don't love you
It's just because I'm meant to be
I'm meant to be free

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on, baby, set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Butterflies were made to fly
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
Oh, don't hold me
Don't hold me, no, no

'Cause it's not because in my heart
Baby, I don't love you
It's only that I'm meant to be
I'm meant to be free

If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on now and set me free
I've got to be free
If you wanna love me
If you wanna hold me
Come on now and set me free
I've got to be free
Sometimes like butterflies
