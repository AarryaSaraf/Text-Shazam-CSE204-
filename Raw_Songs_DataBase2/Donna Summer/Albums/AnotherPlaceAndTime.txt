// I Don't Wanna Get Hurt //

I don't need all my friends to tell me
Things that I already know
Like in the best of all worlds
You shouldn't forget self-control

Don't say I don't know what I'm doing
'cos he said "it's more than a feeling"
And I said "I need you too"
Am I just a fool?

I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt
But I know it's a change I've got to take

I don't need all my friends to remind me
Mistakes that I've already made
I just leave the past behind me
And go on believing that I'll be okay

Some thing are only human
And he said he'd always need me
And I said "I want you too"
Am I just a fool?

I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt
But I know it's a chance I've got to take

Just another heartache

I don't need all my friends to tell me
Things that I already know
Like in the best of all worlds
You shouldn't forget self-control

Don't say I don't know what I'm doing
And he said "it's more than a feeling"
And I said "I need you too"
Am I just a fool?

I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt
But I know it's a chance I've got to take

I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt
But I know it's a chance I've got to take

I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt

// When Love Takes Over You //

You seem to be in a dizzy spin
And you can't work it out
You can't explain the mood you're in
You're stumbling about

But it's the same thing happening to you
As happened to me

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

You've got no time, for anyone
Even your friends get in the way
But you won't take any good advice
Or listen to what I say

Because it don't just happen to you
It happens to everyone

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new 'cos I've been there too
It's all too much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
There are the things we do
When love takes over you

Ooh, baby la, la, la, la
Ooh, baby la, la, la, la

But it's the same thing happening to you
As happened to me

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new 'cos I've been there too
It's all to much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
Over emotional and confused
You can't keep up with your change of moods
But it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

I understand what you're going through
It's nothing new 'cos I've been there too
It's all to much for a girl like you
Yes it's true
These are the things we do
When love takes over you

// This Time I Know It's For Real //

What would I have to do
To get you to notice me too
Do I
Stand in line
One of a million
Admiring eyes

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

Should I write or call your home
Shout it out with a megaphone
Radio, TV news
Got to find a way
To get my message to you

To say I love you with a neon sign
Anything to make you mine

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I wait too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
That this time I know it's for real

Oh baby
This time, this time, this time, this time
Oh baby
This time, this time

Walk a tightrope way up high
Write your name across the sky

I'm going crazy just to let you know
You'd be amazed how much I love you so baby
When I get my hands on you I won't let go
This time I know it's for real

I'm going crazy just to let you know
If I waited too long for you I might explode baby
I've been around the block enough to know
That this time I know it's for real

// The Only One //

If you went away
And I had to live my life without you
If the loving died
I just don't know what I would do

All my life I've been
The one to cry when things went wrong
Oh, oh, all my life
I've been the only one

Don't tell me now I'm not the only one
Don't break my heart, say I'm the only one
You promised me a love forever
So let me never ever hear you say
I'm not the only one

I believe in love
And I built my life around you
I believe in us
And I'm sure that all our dream will come true

So don't ever say
There's someone else inside your heart
Someone else to take my place
And tear our love apart

Don't tell me now I'm not the only one
Don't break my heart, say I'm the only one
You promised me a love forever
So let me never ever hear you say
I'm not the only one

All my life I've been
The one to cry when thing went wrong
Oh, oh, all my life
I've been the only one

Don't tell me now I'm not the only one
Don't break my heart, say I'm the only one
You promised me a love forever
So let me never ever hear you say
I'm not the only one
Don't tell me now I'm not the only one
Don't break my heart, say I'm the only one

// In Another Place And Time //

I can't lie
I was attracted too
Somehow the feelings
Were so strong inside
But I'm not free to be
In love with you maybe
Things would be different
In another place and time

And I can't give you
All you want me to
And I know you deserve
The best from me
But I can't give you more
Of all that you long for
I would have loved you
In another place and time

Dreams aren't always bound to come true
But that's no reason you should cry

'Cos I would have loved you
Really loved you
In another place and time

I'm hurting deep inside
Just want you to know
Oh, I would have loved you
Oh yeah, in another place and time

Fate can't always be led by you
The time ain't right for you and I

In another place and time
In another place and time...

// Sentimental //

Last night
We showed how much we cared
But sadness filled the air
How it made us cry
As we waved goodbye
Then you left me standing there

Last night
I came home on my own
And watched a movie show
And the saddest part
Really broke my heart
As it made me miss you so

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

Last night
I tried to let you know
How it hurts to see you go
And how I want you near
Every time I hear
Our love song on the radio

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

How you made me cry
When we waved good bye
As it made me miss you so

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

I get so sentimental

I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental

// Whatever Your Heart Desires //

I've never had the luck to find
This kind of love in my life before
I knew there must be more
The room started swaying
And bands started playing
Inside of me
Since you stole my heart
Come on boy, take the rest of me
The best of me

What...ever your heart desires
Whatever you may need just for you
What...ever your love requires
I'll follow your ever lead

I glad this time
Fate has changed her mind
Took the tears from my arms
Imitations of love
Just left me feeling bad
All alone and so sad
But this is the best
Love I've ever had, I've ever had

What...ever your heart desires
Whatever you may need just for you
What...ever your love requires
I'll follow your ever lead

I'm not afraid
This time
This is my kind of love
So much joy in my life
More than I was dreaming of
The room started swaying
The band started playing
Inside me
Since you stole my heart
Come on boy, take the rest of me
The best of me

What...ever your heart desires
Whatever you may need just for you
What...ever your love requires
I'll follow your ever lead
What...ever your heart desires
Whatever you may need just for you
What...ever your love requires
I'll follow your ever lead

// Breakaway //

For too long she was feeling
That her love had lost it meaning
She was looking for a reason
Not to breakaway
But I don't think she can take it
She'll be strong enough for two
Although it's hard for her to do
She'll breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ohh she'll breakaway

Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high
And breakaway
Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high

Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway

It's a secret she's been keeping
It's been eating at her heart
Wish I could find the words to tell you
But I don't know where to start
And when she looks into the future
She sees to many problems
There are so many reasons
She should pack up the past
And breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway

Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high
And breakaway
Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high

Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway
She'll breakaway

But I don't think she can take it
And just friendship can't replace it
She'll be strong enough for two
Although it's hard for her to do
She'll breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway

Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high
And breakaway
Forget about the bad times
Remember all the good times
Hold your head up high

Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway
She'll breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ooh she'll breakaway
She'll breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ooh, she'll breakaway
She'll breakaway
Ooh, ooh, ooh breakaway
She'll breakaway
Breakaway

// If It Makes You Feel Good //

So many heartaches I put you through
So much trouble and pain
So many tears I made you cry
I'll never put you though that again

I'm gonna make every minute count
And cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna give it all up to you
If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

You're not alone in the world
There's always someone who cares
This time I'm sure I'm your girl
I'm not going anywhere

Let me show you what the girl can do
I'll cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna love you through, through and through

I kept you waiting for so long
Now I see that I was wrong
I guess love you oh so much
Now I thrill to your touch

I kept you waiting for so long
Now that's all in the past
Don't you say you can't go on
I'm gonna give you love that lasts

I'm gonna make ever minute count
And cover you with all my love

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true

If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna make it all up to you
If it makes you feel good
I'm gonna love you through, through and through

// Love's About To Change My Heart //

I never needed someone
'cos I always led a life of my own
Never waited for the ring of the 'phone
Never had anyone here
When I got home
But love's about to change my heart

I'm waiting for the doorbell to chime
When I always lived one day at a time
I thought that I was getting on fine
Never felt I was alone
'til you change your mind
Love's about to change my heart

Could a day be so long
When I always felt secure and so strong
And all the time as I went along
Never thought I would desire
So much to belong
Love's about to change my heart
Love's about to change my heart, ooh

Never ever thought the sky was so blue
Never ever thought I'd feel so new
Always thought I'd know what to do
But I guess I wasn't counting on you

What did I know
I always felt so much on control
I thought I'd make it all on my own
Never thought I would forget
All I have known
Love's about to change my heart
Love's about to change my heart
Love's about to change, change, change
My heart...
