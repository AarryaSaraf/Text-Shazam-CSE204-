// All Systems Go //

If you're ready to fall in love
Here's the thing you've been dreaming of
Scientific fact that you should know

If you're ready to give your heart
And you don't know which way to start
And you're afraid you'll go against the flow

Ask anyone who's ever been given the blow
If you'll know when all systems are go

All systems go, ohoohoooh
All systems go, ohoohoooh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh

Is your mind in computer mode?
And all your senses in overload
And all controls for take off in your hands

200,000 watts of my love are starting to glow
Let you know that all systems are go

All systems go, ohoohoooh
All systems go, ohoohoooh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh

You're on a one way trip to the sun
Your heart's on fire and you're ready to run
Faster now faster, we're headin' out for planet Mars
Love on sudden impact, everything's under control
And all systems are go

All systems go, ohooh oooh
All systems go, ohooh oooh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh
All systems go, all systems go
All systems go, oo oh oo oh

// Bad Reputation //

When I was young, my momma always told me
I still hear her advice
She said don't ever bet against your feelings
Always think twice
Don't go and throw your love away
To some man just for the night
Promises, promises, don't waste your time
If his intentions don't feel right

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

I'm so thankful momma I am waiting
To find someone who
Was looking in the same direction
That you pointed to

I'll never turn and walk away
If my heart gives me the sign
When the one, comes along
He'll understand
That the wait was worth the while

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation

(Momma said, she said)
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

Your reputation follows you wherever you go
Don't get a bad reputation
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold
Don't get a bad reputation
Don't need a bad reputation..

// Love Shock //

Uuhh, uuhh, uuhh...

Overheating
Heart is speeding up
Now I want you to tell me
Just what's been going on

Your body is freezing
Got all the symptoms of
Someone who's fooling around
With some radioactive love

Any minute you can start
Going out of your mind
I wanna tell you
'Cause it's no crime
The meter's showing
All of your vital signs

Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
Welcome to my world
You've been infected by a
Non-stop electronic girl
Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
This time it's for sure
And I tell you that it won't stop
'Cause they got no cure
Got no cure

You might as well face it
Highly contagious vibe
And if you're good at reading
Well read right between the lines
Supersonic catatonic male
I think you're coming around
But you're still looking very pale

Any second you could start
Losing track of the time
Wanna tell ya and it's no lie
'Cause the meter's
Showing all of your
Vital sign.

Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
Welcome to my world
You've been infected by a
Non-stop electronic girl
Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
This time it's for sure
And I tell you that it won't stop
'Cause they got no cure
Got no cure

Such an extraordinary
Modern day romance
Uhhh yeah
There's nothin' you can do to fight it
Take a chance
Go on and take a chance

Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
Welcome to my world
You've been infected by a
Non-stop electronic girl
Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
This time it's for sure
And I tell you that it won't stop
'Cause they got no cure
Say it's
LOVE SHOCK
Welcome to my world
You've been infected by a
Non-stop electronic girl
Say it's
LOVE SHOCK...

// Jeremy //

Sitting by an open door
With rain dropping in my face
Then lightning strikes
Across the room
I fall in your embrace
It was a lovely rendezvous
Better than anyone ever know

A gentle face a fiery heart
With nothing to conceal
That's what it takes to hold me down
A man with grand appeal
Oh while I draw you to my soul
I feel the fire of love taking control

Jeremy
When I think of you
The good times that we have
The melody
Sings out to me
My heart at your command
Jeremy
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oohh...
You're the only one who can

Silent nights are lonely nights
Whenever we're apart
And every moment you're away
I hide you in my heart
Oh while I draw you to my soul
I feel the fire of love taking control

Jeremy
When I think of you
The good times that we have
The melody
Sings out to me
My heart at your command
Jeremy
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oooh...
You're the only one who can

Jeremy you see
That we are two of a kind
We could stay together baby
For all time
We can live without each other
But it wouldn't be the same
'Cause I am you and you are me
It's never gonna change

Jeremy
When I think of you
The good times that we have
The melody
Sings out to me
My heart at your command
Jeremy
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oooh...
Jeremy
Jeremy oh baby. oh baby..

// Only The Fool Survives //

What went wrong
I was so sure that love had led me to your door
Was it a dream, nothing more

Inside my head
I keep hearing all the tender words we said
Who were they for

We are strong
We can hold on to each other if we try
And make it right, for you and I
There's no goodbyes

Only the fool survives
Only the heart provides
Sweet love and tenderness
Save us tonight

Life is change
But I never want to leave this love behind
We've come too far to lose this time

Where there's love
There is nothing strong enough to come between
What we believe
And break us up where there is love

Only the fool survives
Only the heart provides
Sweet love and tenderness
Save us tonight

Only the fool survives
Even the hardest times
Let all the love we share
Keep us alive

See your eyes in a million faces
See your smiles in a thousand places
And I never escape your memories

You'd be there everywhere that I go
You're the only real thing I know
And I never wanted to be free
Stay here with me

Only the fool survives
Only the heart provides
Sweet love and tenderness
Save us tonight

Only the fool survives
Even the hardest times
Let all the love we share
Keep us alive...

// Dinner With Gershwin //

I want to have dinner with Gershwin
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch
I want to talk theory with Curie
Impossible I guess

I want to talk moods with Picasso
On a rendezvous
I want to fly double with Earhart
I want to get next to you
Next to you

So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete

I want to sing hymns with Mahalia
When the day is through
I want to tell you about it
I want to get next to you
Next to you

So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worry
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete

So close
Just as close as I can get
The rain of your worries
Can't effect
What I feel is what I feel
One touch
Of your greatness
Is what I need
My circle of fantasy
Would be complete

I want to have dinner with Gershwin
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch
I want to talk theory with Curie
Impossible I guess...

// Fascination //

No escaping
No spell is over me
Fantasy's fact you see in my life

Time and motion
Seem to have made a stop
And if the whole world passes by
I wouldn't bat an eye

If you say you were mine

Fascination all I do is
Fascination dream of you

Such devotion
I've never felt before
You opened up a door in my life

No tomorrow
Could there be without you
And if you should say goodbye
I think that I would die

Fascination all I do is
Fascination dream of you

I can't think about anything else
But you

There's nothing I can do
Oh no, oh no
Nothing I can do
Nothing I can do

I can't think about anything else
But you
There's nothing I can do

Fascination all I do is
Fascination dream of you
Fascination all I do is
Fascination dream of you
Fascination...

// Voices Cryin' Out //

Voices cryin' out, voices cryin' out
Voices cryin' out in the night hear them call
Voices cryin' out hear them call

It's a night
Like no other night
It's a day
Almost turning grey
It's a heart
Like a broken heart
It's a wheel
At the end of day
It's the plight
Of a boy who's scared
Of the waves rushing out
And the wind in the air
It's the sight
Of one longing to taste
Of life

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Visions that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices crying out hear them call

It's a song
Of a love unsung
It's the pain
Of just being young
It's a cry
Of a voice unheard
Of a face
Speaking silent words
It's the hope
That the time goes by
Take you upon a wing
Teach your soul to fly
It's a wish
That you'll live your experience life

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Vision that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices crying out hear them call

Oh do you know how it feels to be free
Walking your path of life
Embracing destiny one day at a time

Voices cryin' out...Oh can't you hear them
Voices cryin' out...Listen please, listen to the future
Voices cryin' out...Millions and millions and millions of voices
Voices cryin' out...Oh oh oh oh

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Vision that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices crying out hear them call

Voices crying out in the night hear them call
Voices from some foreign shore
Vision that seem an incredible dream
Echoing for more
Voices cryin' out
Voices cryin' out
Voices cryin' out...

// Thinkin' Bout My Baby //

I was walkin', down the street
I was lookin' to someone who was standing there
And didn't seem to really care

I was lookin' out the window
I was hopin', that the sun would show
Didn't know, didn't know

I was
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby, yeah...

I was searchin', for a summer day
I was hopin', for someone to say
Would you come out?
Instead I stood and I pout

I was wanting, just another chance
To make you, feel my fine romance
Didn't know, want to go
I was
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby,
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby, yeah...

Want my baby, lookin' for him high and the love, yeah
Want my baby, he's the only way to fly I know, yeah

I was searchin' for another day
I was hopin', just to see your smilin' face, your smilin' face

I was
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout him, thinkin' about my baby, yeah, yeah...
Thinkin' bout my baby, thinkin' about my baby
Thinkin' bout my baby, thinkin' about my baby...
