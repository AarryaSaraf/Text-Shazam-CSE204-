// Back In Love Again //

Lately I'm feeling glad I'm alive
'cause when I'm with you,
You make me feel so good inside
Lately it's only you, on my mind
And I have to smile, when I think of you,
Knowing that you are mine
You are mine, you are mine

Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya
Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya

The better I know you, the better I feel
It feels so right, it can't be wrong,
I know this love is real
Baby I'll show you what I feel inside
It's lasted so long, love's growing strong,
Love's growing stronger now
Stronger now, stronger now

Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya
Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya

Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya
Ooh baby, back in love again
Ooh baby, next to you again
Ooh baby, in a crazy spin, love
I want ya, I need ya, I love ya, I want ya

// I Remember Yesterday (Reprise) //

I remember yesterday...

I remember that first night we met
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet
You and me and this fantasy
Oh I remember our first night

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
From the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
Oh I remember that first night

Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night

I saw your lovelight through the candle's glow
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go
And when the night was over,
We both looked around the room
Remember darling, chairs on the table,
And only me and you

I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
And from the very start, you stole my heart
I Knew right then we would never part
I remember that first night

// Black Lady //

It was bad, really mean
She had the kind of reputation to make any woman scream
Late one night, when it wasn't right
And he made a catch, and he meets his match

Black lady, black lady

She was mean, really bad
She was slender as a cat at night, she made the men go mad
Well her eyes were green, and her skin was soft
And the lady's heart was as hard as rock

Black lady, black lady
You better beware, you better beware, you better beware

He tried to fight it, tried to win
But no matter where the poor man turned, the lady halted him
Her wish was his command, his life in her hands
And the death was slow, 'cause she won't let go

Oh, Black lady, that black lady

She tried to win, tried to buy
She was out over him, 'cause he played all the cards just right
He laid out his hand like a winning man
With a smile so deep, she put him into a sleep
You know she won

Black lady, black lady
You better beware, you better beware

Black lady, you better beware
Black lady, black lady, black lady

// Take Me //

Oh baby, I've got all this love, it's more than enough
Oh baby, I'm filled with desire, I'm caught in your fire
Oh baby, you've got the power to turn me on

You knew it, you looked in my eyes, you read in my mind
You move me, spinning me 'round, around and around
Oh you have the power to rule my mind and soul

Take me, I'll be your woman
Use me, make me your own
Take me, make me your woman
Love me now, and don't leave me alone

Oh baby, there's something inside, that's I just can't hide
Oh baby, well I want you so, just take me real slow
Oh baby, you've got the power to turn me on

I want you, I know what I want, I want what I see
I need you, I need you right now, and you know just how
Well I need you to cool the fire that's burning so

Take me, I'll be your woman
Use me, make me your own
Take me, make me your woman
Love me now, and don't leave me alone

Baby, baby, baby, oh baby,
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Take me, I'll be your woman
Use me, make me your own
Take me, make me your woman
Love me now, and don't leave me alone
Love me now, and don't leave me alone
Love me now, and don't leave me alone

// Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over) //

Cold and lonely night, you don't have to leave at all
A car rolls up outside on time, a moment from your call
And handshake seems more fitting than a kiss
Such a shame that you and I should have to end like this

Can't we just sit down and talk it over
Surely you can ask the better way
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late

Can't we just sit down and talk it over
Who knows, maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night
And maybe you and I can talk it out

Tonight stay somewhere warm, they say it's gonna freeze
You may not find a place at all, so be sure and take your keys
I can almost taste the silence now
Does it really matter still,
Who was wrong, who let who down

Can't we just sit down and talk it over
Who knows, maybe in a little while
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night
And maybe you and I can talk it out

Hold on, hold on
Surely you and I can talk it out
Hold on, hold on
Surely you and I can make it right
Hold on, hold on, yeah
Can't we just sit down and talk it over
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
