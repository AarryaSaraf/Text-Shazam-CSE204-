// Prelude To Love //

[Spoken:]
Oh, baby
It's been so long
I've waited so long
And now that I have you
I want you to come
Come
Come 
Come into my arms
Come on, baby
I need you
I need you
Come
Come 
Come into my arms again

// Could It Be Magic //

[Spoken:]
Oh baby it's been so long
I've waited so long
And now that I have you
I want you to come
Come come come into my arms
Oh baby I need you I need you
Come come come into my arms again

Spirits move me
Every time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby, I love you, come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now,
Now, and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?

[Spoken:]
Oh hold on to me
Don't let go
Come into my life
Don't let go
Oh...

Baby, take me high upon a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you, build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby, I love you, come, come,
Come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
And baby, I want you now, now,
Oh now, oh now,  and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last?
Baby, I want you, come, come
Could this be the magic at last?

Could it be magic?
Come, c'mon, c'mon
Come oh oh come into my arms
Oh, let me know the wonder
Of all of you, all of you
Baby, I want you now, now,
Oh now, oh now and hold on fast
Oh could this be the magic at last?

Come, c'mon, c'mon,
Come oh oh come into my arms
Oh, let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now, now, oh now,
Oh now and hold on fast
Oh, could this be the magic at last?
Could it be the magic?

// Wasted //

Wasted
I'm so wasted
Empty since you left me
I still need him and want him
Without him I'm nothing
If I can't do something
To get him to come home on to me

Wasted
Love's been wasted
Guess I'm not too brainy
I was selfish and foolish
I used and abused him
And laughed when he threatened to walk out
But now he's done it

He was like the moon
He had his darker side
But he could be the sun
Shinning in the light

Wasted
Sure I'm wasted
Knowing he don't love me
Such a sad thing about him
To know that I love him
And nothing I say or I do will return
Say I'm wasted

He was like the moon
He had his darker side
But he could be the sun
Shinning in the light

Wasted
Sure I'm wasted
Knowing he don't love me
Wasted
Sure I'm wasted
Knowing he don't love me..

// Come With Me //

Come with me
Come with me
Lose yourself
Let love be
I will lead you there keep you there
Give my share and take my share
Set you free
If you will come with me

Come with me
Come with me
And leave out fantasies
We'll just take it slow as we go
Enjoy it all as we fall
Into love's stream
If you will come with me

Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh

Come with me
Come with me
I give love's guarantee
It will turn you on
Right or wrong
Make you feel you belong
Turn the key
If you will come with me

Come with me
Come with me
I give love's guarantee
I will turn you on
Right or wrong
Make you feel you belong
Turn the key
If you will come with me

Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, uh uh...
