By the Time I Get to Phoenix
Was the last song on your mind the day you left
You woke up in Nogales
With Tequila with her name across your chest

You've stumbled through the morning
In these border tourists' dusty avenues
Singing Everyday's The Hurting Kind
And everyday you live, you're Born to Lose

You missed the last train home
The whistle blew and now she's gone
West Texas dust beneath your nails
You're hammered down the heartbreak trail
And you've missed the last train home
That whistle blew... she's solid gone

Now, you're wandering El Paso
Searching for your broken heart and truth
She was all you ever had
And the only thing you ever had to lose

With a juke box playing Charlie Rich
You're lining up your shots at half past noon
You threw your ring across the bar
And sang along to Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues

Now don't go to Tulsa where she's bound
You'll end up six feet underground
Your ex-friend, Charlie's there abouts
He never missed the last train out

You missed the last train home
That whistle blew... she's solid gone

You missed the last train home
That whistle blew... she's solid gone
