You ran up against the rain
Everyday of your short life
Suffered for your muse without complaining
Never heard you swear life isn't fair
But it doesn't make it right
You left the world knowing all too well what pain is

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain

You listen to the songs
And then you wrote your own
Somewhere along the way
You passed the muse along
I feel your presence in this room
Beneath the wailing moon
It's good to know that dying couldn't tame you

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain

Last night the weather turned
This morning we had snow
Today they'll lay you in the ground
Someday we'll all know
Where it is we go
My tears will say goodbye
While the rain is coming down

You took it on yourself to pave the road to hell
Paid your dues and sang the blues
Lord, you knew them all too well
Every word upon the page
You let them sail away
The wind would blow, and then you'd go
Up against the rain
