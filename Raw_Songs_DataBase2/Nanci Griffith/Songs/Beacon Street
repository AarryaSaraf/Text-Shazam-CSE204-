Gonna wake up crazy to the cry of the trains on Beacon Street
So far from home, so far from love, so far from a friend in need
And all I need is a heart to hold and a good night's sleep
And all I have is the cry of the trains as they bid farewell on Beacon Street

And here I am again
I'm in the company of strangers
It's a cold winter wind that sings a song
You say your love is lost
I'm not the kind who lingers on
So it's farewell to your heart
'Cause when the love is gone, it's gone

I never did feel lonely till I looked in the mirror and all I could see
Was a little bit of you in the corner of an eye in need of a good night's sleep
And all I need is to close my eyes to find my dreams
And all I had was the cry of the trains as we bid farewell on Beacon Street

And here I am again
I'm in the company of strangers
It's a cold winter wind that sings a song
You say your love is lost
I'm not the kind who lingers on
So it's farewell to your heart
'Cause when the love is gone, it's gone

Gonna wake up crazy to the cry of the trains on Beacon Street
So far from home, so far from love, so far from a friend in need
And all I need is a heart to hold and a good night's sleep
And all I have is the cry of the trains as they bid farewell on Beacon Street

And all I had was the cry of the trains as we bid farewell on Beacon Street
And all I had was the cry of the trains as we bid farewell on Beacon Street
Bid farewell to a lonely heart on Beacon Street
