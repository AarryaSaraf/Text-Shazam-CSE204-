I'll never fall in love again
It's such a contradiction
To lose all control and common sense
And even intuition

You came along, with a strange new song
And the sweetest innovation
And you said, "One should never fall in love
But rise to the occasion"

To have loved and lost, I know the cost
I fell and almost drowned
If not for you, I'd have missed this view
From higher ground

Now we can touch the sky above
At the Angel's invitation
And we don't even have to fall in love
Just rise to the occasion

Love should be pure and free
A smiling inspiration
And one should never fall in love
But rise to the occasion
