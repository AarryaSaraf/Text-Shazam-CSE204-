I know you believe in miracles
That this love will come back around
I know you believe the grass is growing
Across this winter
To the south of this town

I know your kiss is sweeter
Than the dust that this love has become
Yet, I know your path is clearer
Shed of me, out there on your own

I don't intend to sound ungrateful
You've given love when I had none
My feet had tread upon the road you're on
And I know it's not my way home
I know, it's not my way home
I know, it's not my way home

You know, this love has left us
Don't count the years, it took a long time to kill
I know you will find a place for memories
And you'll be out there runnin', I will be here to be still
