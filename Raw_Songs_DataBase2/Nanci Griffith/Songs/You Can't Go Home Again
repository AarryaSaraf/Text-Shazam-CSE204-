So much silence to my hometown streets
Gonna put my cheek to the window and watch it sleep
Where the shadow's fall from sycamore trees
Fight off this north wind and I'll be headin' back east

Let the Colorado River roll on the sea
I will be crossing it in changes
This 'ole town never did really care
That much for me
I don't know why I always come here
In my dreams

It's the hardest to hold but it's the easiest to find
If you'll slip for the dollar I'll fall in the wine
But you cannot save your past for today
It will leave you cold on an outbound train

Let the Colorado River roll on the sea
I will be crossing it in changes
This 'ole town never did really care
That much for me
I don't know why I always come here
In my dreams

Folded memories in my soul
It's that old blue line that you can never go back home
So I'm waiting for the moon to rise
He'll kiss my tears away and set my heart in line

Let the Colorado River roll on the sea
I will be crossing it in changes
This 'ole town never did really care
That much for me
I don't know why I always come here
In my dreams

Let the Colorado River roll on to the sea
I will be crossing it in changes
This 'ole town never did really care that much for me
I only come here to remember my dreams
Sleep tight
Hill Country town
Goodnight
