Oh, the grace that true love holds when hearts grow weary for
Time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold
And it'll always come home

True love is faithful all on it's own
Hearts know when they should fly alone
When the mind is rested and the heart's at ease
Two loves can give to each other's needs

Oh, the grace that true love holds when hearts grow weary for
Time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold
And it'll always come home

You can fool yourself and fool your dreams
But you can't fool your heart and you can't fool me
Love is a sailor sailing out to sea
One of these days you'll need the harbour in me

Oh, the grace that true love holds when hearts grow weary for
Time alone
You give it room and the warm to hold
And it'll always come home
Oh, give it room and the warm to hold and it'll always
Come home
