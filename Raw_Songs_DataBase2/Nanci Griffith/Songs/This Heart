This heart was almost taken
This heart had a love of its own
This heart was reawakened
When you came along

This heart was born feet running
This heart saw your porch-light on
This heart hit the sidewalk wondering
Why you left it on

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart hears the telephone ringing
This heart's gonna let it go
'Cause this heart knows the bells she's hearing
Aren't the telephone

This heart has heard your laughter
This heart has learned how to smile
This heart'll be your true believer
If you stay a while

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart

This heart was stranded in the winter
Was stuck out in a blizzard in its summer clothes
This heart knows when the love comes
And when it goes

This heart was almost taken
This heart was born feet running
This heart hears the telephone ringing
Gonna let it go

This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
This heart
