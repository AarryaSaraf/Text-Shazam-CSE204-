When you say I love you
Is it just because you know that's what I want to hear?
And lately friends are warning me
What they hesitate to tell me leaves a thread of fear
People talk around this town
And when the final truth comes down
There's only one thing left to do
It's come back 'round to you
(Come back 'round to you)

Say it isn't so
Tell me that you're someone
I'll believe in
Am I the last to know
That you don't love me anymore?
Uh if you ever did
Say it isn't so
Am I caught up in a web
You are weaving?
Oh, the stories I've been told
Indicate that you're already
Reachin' for the door

It's just a lover's situation
Are you in or out of love?
I've heard those words before
I've had to face up to the truth
'Cause staying and pretending
Would had hurt him more
Sometimes lovers stay too long
Sometimes they leave too soon
But there's only one thing left to do
It's come back 'round to you
(Come back 'round to you)

And say it isn't so
Tell me that you're someone
I'll believe in
Am I the last to know
That you don't love me anymore?
If you ever did
Say it isn't so
Am I caught up in a web
That you are weaving?
Oh, the stories I've been told
Indicate that you're already
Reachin' for the door

Oh, the stories I've been told
Baby say it isn't so
