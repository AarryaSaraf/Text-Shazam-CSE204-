I should have known that you were gone back in Germany
You told me in the dark while I was sleeping
Then you slept through the sunrise
As it washed across your face
And all that I had heard were our hearts beating

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

I cannot find a place to put this love away
Or lose the thought of sunlight on your face
I thought I heard your voice
Say I love you today
But it was only the sound of my heart beating

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

How I wish that I could take us back to Germany
I would stay awake and you would talk to me
Yet for every drop of rain I hear
There's bound to fall another tear
Upon this page of song of my heart aching

Talk to me while I'm listening
While this love has a voice that we both
Can hear
Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

Before you let it go
This greatest love I've ever known
Won't you please
Talk to me
While I'm listening

Talk to me
Talk to me
