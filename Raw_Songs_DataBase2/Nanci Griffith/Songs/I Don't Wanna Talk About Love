I don't wanna talk about love
'Cause I've heard it before
And it talks too loud
You can hear it in a disco midnight
Shouting
I don't wanna think about it
Think about it
It comes dressed in its summer clothes
When you're traveling through the heart of the winter's cold

I don't wanna talk about changes
Changes come of their own free will
And if you wanna talk about leavin'
Well, you've always walked
And, you always will
Everytime you talk about love
You talk about your yesterdays
Yesterday's washing away with this morning's rain

I don't wanna talk about it
'Cause love has a voice of its own
If all we do is try to out shout it
Then the love is gone

I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now
I don't wanna talk about love now

Can't you hear the voice in my heart
It calls your name in the middle of the night
It's always been a quiet voice when it's breaking
I don't wanna talk about this love
This love was my saving grace
So, can't I just say that I love you
And we'll call it a day?
