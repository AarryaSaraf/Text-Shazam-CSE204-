Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul

Look at my life
Here in these photographs
Look at these faces
What a story they tell
There was a time
When I knew how to laugh
I'd drink to forget
But I remember it well

Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul

So many promises
So many daydreams and plans
So many chances
That I let slip through my hands

Pour me a drink
Light me a cigarette
Help me forget
The things that I've done
Pour me a drink
Then pour me another one
To keep out this cold wind
That blows through my soul
