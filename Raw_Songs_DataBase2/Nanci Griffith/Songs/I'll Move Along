This flesh and bone ain't much protection
For an honest heart like mine
A broken home for good intentions
Damaged inventions of my design

I'll move along (time to move along)
I'll move along (time to move along)

I'm slow to move these feet of clay
You passed me by now you're in my way
I take my change at my own damn pace
I'll move along one day

I'll move along (time to move along) (come on let's go)
I'll move along (time to move along) (come on let's go)

I don't say much I was born to listen
Tell me now, did I hear you wrong?
This was love not the Inquisition
If it was my decision we should move along

You passed me by now you're in my way
I'll move along one day
