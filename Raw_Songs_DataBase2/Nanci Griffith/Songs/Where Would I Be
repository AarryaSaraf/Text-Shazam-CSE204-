Tell me where
Would I be now without you
Without an angel
Watching out for me

Took a long, long time
For me to realize
All my faith in you
Was so justified

Tell me where
Would I be without you
Where would I turn
To find the truth I need

I could never go back
To where I used to be
I've got so used to having
All the love you give to me

Tell me where
Would I be without you now

And every time I stumble or fall
I call your name and you'll be there
Or if I should fly too high
I know your love will reach me anywhere

I could never go back
To where I used to be
I've got so used to having
All the love you give to me

Tell me where
Would I be now without you
Would I be lost
Just drifting out to sea

If I could start all over
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause I know you'll always
Be there through thick and thin

Tell me where
Would I be without you now
