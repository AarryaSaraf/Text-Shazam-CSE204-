I am not a child, though you'll treat me as you've always seen me
You never saw the changes in a heart grown old and wise
Hey, it's good to see you smile, it's been so long between the pages
Wheels out on the highway seem to laugh between my lines

Do you still want to know?
Where does the love go when it dies?
Hey, I want you to know... love never dies
It is sheltered here very safe inside and it's left you
With a friend out in the madness

And you say you love me still
How your soul does change and your heart still ponders
How I could grow fonder... of a life out on my own
I still sing the harmony
I'll have another wine and toast this madness
I'll howl at your moon... on my way home alone

Do you still want to know?
Where does the love go when it dies?
Hey, I want you to know... love never dies
It is sheltered here very safe inside and it's left you
With a friend out in the madness

Do you still want to know?
Where does the love go when it dies?
Hey, I want you to know... love never dies
It is sheltered here very safe inside and it's left you
With a friend out in the madness
