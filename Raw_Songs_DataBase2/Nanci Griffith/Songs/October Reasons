I'm gonna open up the window and let in October
And roll up my sleeves in the rain

Roll out on the freeway with a heart a little harder
Breezes gettin' cooler by the day
5 a.m. travelers, bleary eyed and lonely
We're all countin' miles and tradin' lanes
But if I stopped to call you
What would I say?
Hell, I know I'd feel the same
I can open up the window and let in October
Roll up my sleeves in the rain

Gonna tie up the pieces and sleep out in the country
Where the phone don't ring my dues to pay
And the echoes of your city
No longer call my name
I said I wasn't happy anyway
The ghosts in the closet
You need to drive away
Ain't gonna take this pride I've saved
I can open the window and let in October
And roll up my sleeves in the rain

Ain't it gonna be hard when you realize
You're still the same old fool inside
I ain't gonna let your blues take the prize

So honey open up the window and let in October
You may never love quite the same
And it's yesterday's mornin's
Lord they'll always remain
