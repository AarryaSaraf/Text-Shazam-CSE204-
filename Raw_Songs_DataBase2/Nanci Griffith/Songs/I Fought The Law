Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money and I had none
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the lawn won

I left my baby and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Robbin' people with a zip gun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I miss my baby and good fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Left my bay and I feel so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
