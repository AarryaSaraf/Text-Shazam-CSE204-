Before you marry, before you mend
Or have someone's children, long before then
You could find something with somebody new
Try the love I'm offering in my open arms
Before you do

We should have quarreled, it's so unwise
To cut yourself loose with only some lies
Wasn't my first time, it won't be my last
Try the love that took only a minute to grow
It won't die that fast

Try the love that the keeper of the keys
Told me one time was clearly not for me
He's not keepin' no more
It's the kind when held up to a flame
Whispers one word, darlin' always your name
Of this you can be sure

I have a home now, you should come back
It's got so much room that I can't unpack
This is my wish, dear, a now spoken truth
Try the love that once hidden now seems so alive
It's waiting on you

Try the love that once hidden now seems so alive
It's waiting on you
