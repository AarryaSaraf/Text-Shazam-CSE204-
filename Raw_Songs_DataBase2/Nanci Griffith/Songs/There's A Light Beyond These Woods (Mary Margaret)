There's a light beyond these woods, Mary Margaret
Do you think that we will go there
And see what makes it shine, Mary Margaret?
It's almost morning, and we've talked all night
You know we've made big plans for ten-year-olds
You and I

Have you met my new boy friend, Margaret?
His name is John, and he rides my bus to school
And he holds my hand
He's fourteen, he's my older man
But we'll still be the best of friends
The three of us, Margaret, John, and I

Let's go to New York City, Margaret
We'll hide out in the subways
And drink the poets' wine, oh
But I had John, so you went and I stayed behind
But you were home in time for the senior prom
When we lost John

The fantasies we plan, I'm living them now
All the dreams we sang when we knew how
Well, they haven't changed
There's never been two friends like you and me
Mary Margaret

It's nice to see you family growing, Margaret
Your daughter and your husband there
They really treat you right
But we've talked all night
And what about the light, that glowed beyond
Our woods when we were ten?
You were the rambler then

The fantasies we planned, well, Maggie
I'm living them now
All the dreams we sang, oh, we damn sure knew
How... but I haven't changed
There'll never be two friends like you and me
Maggie, can't you see?

There's a light beyond your woods, Mary Margaret
