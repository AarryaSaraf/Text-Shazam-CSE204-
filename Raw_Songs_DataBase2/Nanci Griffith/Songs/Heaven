I think I'll go to Heaven
There I will lay me down
Leave all the pain behind me
I'll bury it in the ground
Maybe they'll talk about me
I pray it won't be lies
I think I'll go to Heaven
Heaven is in your eyes

I think I'll go to Heaven
I heard it's peaceful there
They don't allow your troubles
Everyone's had their share
And if I can be someone who never needs a disguise
Then maybe I'll go to Heaven
Heaven is in your eyes

People in Heaven never look back
Higher and higher the past fades to black
Maybe I'll go to Heaven
I'll sail onto the night
I'll watch as I set my soul free
Watch as my heart takes flight
Maybe I am too simple
Maybe I am too wise
And maybe I'll go to Heaven
Heaven is in your eyes
