I have traveled far to be sitting here with you
And I will leave this place alone
That's a sad and simple truth
There is so little time and so much to say
And I'll be none the wiser
When I leave you here today

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is

It always stops me cold every time I hear your name
The friends that we have shared
Know I'll never love the same
I still hear your voice echo through the days
Yet it never breaks my stride
'Cause we would always end this way

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is

We were really something
Holding hands and walkin'
Now, no amount of talkin'
Could lend this love a place to go

Is this all there is
I wanted so much more
The gold in those hills
The silver of the moors
And now that I'm here
Looking you head on
You're the treasure that I left behind
And all I'll ever miss
The blame for losing love is blind
Is this all there is
