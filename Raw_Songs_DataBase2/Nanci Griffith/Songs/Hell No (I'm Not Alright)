Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day and ask all night
Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day and ask all night
Nothing's gonna change, no end in sight
Hell no, I'm not all right

Did you really think you could be okay
To leave me stranded alone that day
Did you really think you could wait so long
To call me up to see if you're all right

Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day and ask all night
Nothing's gonna change, no end in sight
Hell no, I'm not all right

And you're on the phone when I'm alone
And when you're alone you're all alone
I'm still gone, it's all the same
But I'm taking notes and I'm naming names

Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day and ask all night
Nothing's gonna change, no end in sight
Hell no, I'm not all right

Am I the one, to get you to forget
That the one is gone, gone is gone
Am I suppose to say you're okay
'Cause you're not okay and your not okay

Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day, you can ask all night
Nothing's gonna change, no end in sight
Hell no, I'm not all right

Hell no, I'm not all right
You can talk all day and ask all night
Nothing's gonna change, no end in sight
Hell no, I'm not all right
Hell no, I'm not all right
Hell no, I'm not all right
