The wing and the wheel, they carry things away
Whether it's me that does the leavin' or the love that flies away
The moon outside my window looks so lonely tonight
Oh, there's a chunk out of it's middle, big enough for an old fool to hide

Where are all the dreamers that I used know?
We used to linger beneath street lamps in the halos and the smoke
The wing and the wheel, came to carry them away
Now they all live out in the suburbs where their dreams
Are in their children at play

There's a pale sky in the east, all the stars are in the west
Oh, here's to all the dreamers, may our open hearts find rest
The wing and the wheel are gonna carry us along
And we'll have memories for company, long after the songs are gone
