Oh, the night was clear and the stars were shinin'
And the moon came up so quiet in the sky
And all the people gathered 'round while the band was a-tunin'
I can hear them now playin' "Coming Through the Rye"

She was dressed in blue and she looked so lovely
Just a gentle flower of a small town girl
Then he took her hand and they danced to the music
With a single smile she became his world

And they danced all ni-i-ght to the fiddle and the banjo
Their drifting tunes seemed to fill the air
So long ago, but they still remember
When they fell in love at the Roseville Fair

Now, they courted well, and they courted dearly
They'd rock for hours in the front porch chair
Then a year went by from the time that he met her
And he made her his at the Roseville Fair

And they danced all ni-i-ght to the fiddle and the banjo
Their drifting tunes seemed to fill the air
So long ago, but they still remember
When they fell in love at the Roseville Fair

So here's a song for all the lovers
And here's a tune that you can share
May you dance all night to the fiddle and the banjo
The way they did at the Roseville Fair
The way they did at the Roseville Fair
