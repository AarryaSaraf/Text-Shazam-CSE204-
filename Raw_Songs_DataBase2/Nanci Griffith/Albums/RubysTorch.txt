// Brave Companion Of The Road //

Where are you going there?
With your suitcase by the back porch stairs
With my heart in your hand
In this cold December wind again
The cafes and bars are closed
The Christmas lights are veiled in snow
Tell me where are you going?
My brave companion of the road

It seems to me that you are lonelier
Than I've ever seen you be
Oh, it's plain to see
That you've gone crazier
Than you ever thought you'd be
When the lights go down
And the dance floor is empty
And the crowd is going home
I will be waiting
For my brave companion of the road

Some days come up roses
Some days just come and go
Some nights are so ruthless
That you can't recall the day before
This love has seen better days
Than home for these holidays
'Cause this love has miles for sense of place
Oh, my brave companion of the road

Tell me, where are you going?
My brave companion of the road

// Late Night Grande Hotel //

I'm working on a morning flight to anywhere but here
I'm watching this evening fire burn away my tears
All my life I've left my troubles by the door
'Cause leaving is all I've ever known before

It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down
It's not the way you call my name that left me stranded on the ground
It's not the way you'll say you'll hear my heart when the music ends
No... I am just learning how to fly away again

It's not the way you say you'll hear my heart when the music ends
I am just learning how to fly away again

And maybe you were thinking that you thought you knew me well
But no one ever knows the heart of anyone else
I feel like Garbo in this Late Night Grande Hotel
'Cause living alone is all I've ever done well

It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down
It's not the way you call my name that left me stranded on the ground
It's not the way you'll say you'll hear my heart when the music ends
No... I am just learning how to fly away again

It's not the way you hold me when the sun goes down
It's not the way you call my name that left me stranded on the ground
It's not the way you'll say you'll hear my heart when the music ends
No... I am just learning how to fly away again

It's not the way you'll say you'll hear my heart when the music ends
No... I am just learning how to fly away again

// In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning //

In the wee small hours of the morning
While the whole wide world is fast asleep
You lie awake and think about the girl
And never ever think of counting sheep

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
You'd be hers if only she'd call
In the wee small hours of the morning
That's the time you miss her most of all

// When I Dream //

I could have a mansion that is higher than the trees
I could have all the gifts I want and never ask please
I could fly to Paris, oh, it's at my beck and call
Why do I go through life with nothing at all

But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

I can be the singer or the clown in every room
I can even call someone to take me to the moon
I can put my makeup on and drive the men insane
I can go to bed alone and never know his name

But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

But when I dream, I dream of you
Maybe someday you will come true

// If These Walls Could Speak //

If these old walls
If these old walls could speak
What a tale it had to tell
Hard headed people raising hell
A couple in love living week to week
Rooms full of laughter
If these old walls could speak

If these old halls
If hallowed halls could talk
These would have a tale to tell
The sun going down and dinner bell
And children playing at hide and seek
From floor to rafter
If these old halls could speak

They would tell you that I'm sorry
For being cold and blind and weak
They would tell you that it's only
That I have a stubborn streak
If these old walls could speak

If these old fashioned
Window panes had eyes
I guess they would've seen it all
Each little tear and sigh and footfall
And every dream that we came to seek
Or followed after
If these old walls could speak

They would tell you that I owe you
More than I can ever pay
Here's someone who really loves you
Don't ever go away
Is what these walls would say

If they were not so mean
If these old walls could speak

// Ruby's Arms //

He will leave behind all of his clothes
He wore when he was with her
All he need's are his railroad boots
And his leather jacket
As he say goodbye to Ruby's arms
Although his heart is breaking
He will steal away out through her blinds
For soon she will be waking

Morning light has washed her face
And everything is turning blue now
She holds onto her pillow case
There's nothing he can do now
As he says goodbye to Ruby's arms
He says she'll find another soldier
And he swears to God by Christmas time
There'll be someone else to hold you

The only thing he's taking is
The scarf off of her clothesline
He'll hurry past her chest of drawers
And her broken wind chimes
As he says goodbye
He says goodbye
Goodbye to Ruby's arms

He will feel his way down her darkened hall
And out into the morning
The hobos in the freight yards
Have kept their fires burning
And Jesus Christ this cold hard rain
Won't someone put him on his train
He'll never kiss her lips again
Or break her heart
As he says goodbye
He says goodbye
Say goodbye to Ruby's arms

// Never Be The Sun //

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us
On a moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven
Although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean
You will be the light

You may not always shine as you go
Barefoot over stones
You might be so long together
Or you might walk alone
And you won't find that love comes easy
But that love is always right
So even when the dark clouds gather
You will be the light

And if you lose a part inside
When love turns around on you
Leaving the past behind
Is knowing you'll do as you always do
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us
On a moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven
Although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean
You will be the light
You will be the light
You will be the light

// Bluer Than Blue //

After you go, I can catch up on my reading
And after you go, I'll have a lot more time for sleeping
And when you're gone
Looks like things are gonna get a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone
I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no TV shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

'Cause I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue

// Grapefruit Moon //

Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me
I heard that tune and now I'm pining, honey, can't you see
Every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide

Never had no destination, could not get across
And you became my inspiration, oh, but what a cost
Every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide

Now I'm smoking cigarettes and strive for purity
And I'll slip just like the stars into obscurity
Every time I hear that melody, it puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can see

// Please Call Me, Baby //

The evening fell just like a star
Left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
I just know there's got to be more

So please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

I admit that I ain't no angel
I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind
If I exorcise my devils
Well my angels may leave too
When they leave they're so hard to find

So please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

And we're always at each other's throats
You know it drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me, baby
I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams

So please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
And I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain

// Drops From The Faucet //

The drops from the faucet like a nervous heart
Beat on my porcelain sink a rhythm avant-garde
I page through the phone book, reach for my fountain pen
Is he comin' in for the holidays to haunt me again?
I call up Grand Central, "information please
Is that nickel line on time? Oh fine!"
It's a hair-do with a wave
We both forgot and forgave last time

A peddlar of pots and pans down on Union Square
Said City Hall wants us off the street
There's no Christmas in the air
Some high-brows were waiting
Carnation bright lapels
Their big cars lined the curbs outside those grand hotels
I passed a marquee, Third Avenue
"Ramona" with Loretta Young and I swung myself around
And (headed) uptown to the train

So this is New year's eve another year has passed
We wait so patiently, (but) still they come and go so fast
I stand on this platform, wait for that basket of light
And the sound of the whistle screamin' out
Like some hot trumpet in the night
And... as I'm waitin' I wonder why and where
And what went wrong
But this song don't tell no lies
It was just a quick good-bye, yeah
