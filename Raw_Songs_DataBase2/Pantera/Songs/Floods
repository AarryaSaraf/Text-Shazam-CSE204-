A dead issue
Don't wrestle with it
Deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss
So inviting (let me in)

Nailed to the cross
I feel you, relate to you, accuse you
Wash away us all
Take us with the floods
Then throughout the night, they were raped and executed
Cold hearted world

Your language unheard of
the vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity
Is seen one sidedly

Burn away the day
The nervous, the drifting, the heaving
Wash away us all, take us with the floods
Then throughout the day mankind played with grenades
Cold hearted world
And at night they might bait the pentagram
Extinguishing the sun
Wash away man, take him with the floods
