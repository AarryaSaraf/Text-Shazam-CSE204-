All alone this lonely night
I've been thinkin' about you
And now I'm on my own, just ain't right
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go

I can't take it
I can't make it alone, no

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I can't sleep, I need your touch
Lying here right beside me
I was in too deep, meant too much
Something free that reminds me

I can't take it
I can't make it alone, no

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I keep thinkin' love is gonna find a way
I feel it comin', love will find a way!

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

Over my head...
Over...
Over...
