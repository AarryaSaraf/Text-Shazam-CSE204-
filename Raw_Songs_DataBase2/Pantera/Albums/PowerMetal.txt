// Down Below //

People running in the street
Looking for some meat to eat
It's in your dirty magazines
All across your TV screens

Midnight riders
In the street
Feel the fire
Catch the heat

You better go down below!
You better go down below!

See the ladies of the night
Built for speed to my delight
I steal them in my limousine
Hear them shout hear them scream

Midnight riders
In the street
Feel the fire
Catch the heat

It's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

You better go down below!
You better go down below!

(And she's down for the count!)

// Rock The World //

In these times 
Of confusion and sin 
We must redeem 
Our human ways 
This force that 
Fights to live 
Will fight 
Till it dies 
And rise again 
To save the day 

[CHORUS]
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 
WE ALL 
ROCK THE WORLD 

The power grows 
To destroy 
This flag of hate 
That waves so 
High in the air 
We raise our fists 
In rebellion we stand 
Our hungry hearts 
Set the snare 

[CHORUS]

Ageless as time 
Change is revealed 
We will rock for you

// Power Metal //

You say you want it loud 
I'll never turn it down 
You wanta feel my power 
Pound you in the ground 
I wanta give you fury 
Blow your head apart 
I'll leave you comatose 
From the very start 

You say you want some Metal 
I'll give you all i've got 
My deadly grasp is lethal 
This force will never stop 

POWER METAL 
ROCK FOREVER 
POWER METAL 
ON FOREVER 

I am the metal beast 
The battle dog I deal 
My soul was spawned in hell 
My body coiled steel 
Put on this earth to 
Melt it down to the core 
I'll make you feel such pain 
You're comin' back for more 

You say you want some Metal 
I'll give you all i've got 
My deadly grasp is lethal 
This force will never stop 

POWER METAL 
ROCK FOREVER 
POWER METAL 
ON FOREVER

// We'll Meet Again //

I walk the 
Streets of darkness 
Where hell awaits 
Guarded by the mystery 
Just beyond the gates 
Searching for the answer 
Every man must find 
Before eternity beckons 
I will make you mine 

GOODBYE MYSTERY 
GOODBYE PAIN 
GOODBYE LOVE 
WE'LL MEET AGAIN 

In another lifetime 
She'll take another man 
She's left me here to die! 
Its killing me again!!!!!!!!!! 

GOODBYE MYSTERY 
GOODBYE PAIN 
GOODBYE LOVE 
WE'LL MEET AGAIN

// Over And Out //

Slaving for eternity 
Aiming for construction 
Wreckless crew abandon me 
Bringing on destruction 
Primal needs, annoying ways 
INCAPACITATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
A legacy of submankind 
Who seem to rule this nation 

Out of touch with your life 
Can' t you see the signs 
For me to know 
Can you find out 
Read betwen the lines 

NO WAY OUT 
When the cat goes away 
OVER AND OUT 
The mice come out and play 

Unrelentless trilogy 
Asking to accept them 
Tempers flare 
Screams are heard 
To uphold the profession 
Time and time and times again 
I will not play your game 
I ask you once a billion times 
To keep your life the same 

NO WAY OUT 
When the cat goes away 
OVER AND OUT 
The mice come out and play 
NO WAY OUT 
The price that you must pay 
OVER AND OUT 
Ev'ry dog has its day

// Proud To Be Loud //

Listen up good 
I got a lot to say 
I know what I want 
And I get my own way 
I call 'em as I see 'em 
I don't play by the book 
One dose of volume 
That's all it took 
I've seen it, I've done it 
I've heard it before 
Now it's my turn 
To settle the score 
I'll sing it, I'll shout it 
I'll say it again 
I don't care if they 
Never give in cause I'm 

PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
YOU KNOW I'M PROUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 

Well I've alway believed 
In freedom of speech 
And i've always been the one 
Who practiced what I preached 
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT 
I'll give you the choice 
But it'll snow in hell 
Before I lower my voice 
I live it, I breathe it 
I gotta have more 
It's full blast 
And this means war 
The power, the glory 
Its callin' my name 
I won't start to 
Play their game cause I'm 

PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
I'M PROUD TO BE LOUD 
AND I'LL NEVER 
TURN IT DOWN AGAIN NO!! 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
PROUD TO BE LOUD 
I'M PROUD, 
PROUD TO BE LOUD

// Death Trap //

I see you runnin' 
You're gone 
A million miles away 
But you know I'm comin' 
Violenz that 
Blows you into space 
And you think 
You're gonna get away 
Like you did before 
But you're the type 
I never feel sorry for, so 

FALL INTO MY DEATH TRAP 
FALL INTO MY DEATH TRAP 

Life's paranoia 
You're hiding in 
The dark all day 
At nite I call you 
Cause I know 
You're always wide awake 
So you never 
Sleep at all at nite 
Extermination 
Of you're wasted life 

So now I've got you 
You're cornered like a fool 
I terminate you 
Live by my golden rule 
Task complete 
And once again I've won 
Now I search 
For another victim to come 
I can't explain the sheer 
Thrill of it all 
Its such a chill 
To watch the meek just fall 

DEATH TRAP DEATH TRAP 
DEATH TRAP DEATH TRAP 
FALL IN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

// Hard Ride //

You're in the danger zone 
You can't be left alone 
Your heart is 
In this for the ride 
But when it comes down to it 
You spoke your mind and you blew it 
I want you when I want 
And still I hear you say 

[CHORUS]

HARD RIDE WITH ME 
Its a matter of time before 
You fall down on your knees 
HARD RIDE STAY FREE 
Its a matter of time 
'fore its too late 

The pressure's building up 
You feel you've had enough 
So go now -AWAY  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I'll lay it on the table 
You're feelin' so unstable 
I want to love you 
But you seem so far away !!!!!! 

[CHORUS]

And I don't even know your name 
I just wanta throw you away !!!!!!!!!!

// Burnnn //

We wanna live our life forever each day.
To burn your candle at both ends.
Mach 10 velocity not slowing down at all.
Your metal heart just never bends.

Don't stop to wait for life just burn it to the ground.

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.
Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.
Live hard, die great, burn it down!

As the years go by.
The road gets very steep.
It's time to stand or fall.
Can't leave my politics and words, honestly.
It took you going, after all.

Don't stop to wait for life just burn it to the ground.

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.
Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.
Live hard, die great, burn it down!

Show 'em now!

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.
Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.

Burnnn!
It's time to sweat, have no regret, just burn it down.
Burnnn!
All your living for, is the glory in your heart.
Live hard, die great, burn it down!

// P.S.T."88" //

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight

Just keep it coming, Jesus keep me please
If you know what's good for you, you'll be looking for me
I know you know I can please
Oh yes last night was crazy, got in a fight, Saturday night
But tonight...

Now you're gonna make it right
Slip and dance with me all night

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight. Alright!

Coors light on ice, she's getting quiet
She's feeling my rise
Don't stop, roll dice
She's got my rod in the thighs

Oh yes tonight feels crazy
Hoping for tight, you know it might
Call it a date, I can't fucking wait
As she pumps it feels right, I can hang all night

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight. Alright!

I can hang all night!

Pussy tight, tonight, pussy tight!

Loose will occur, when the puss starts to purr
You know what you are, you fuck us so hard

Pussy tight alright [backwards]
