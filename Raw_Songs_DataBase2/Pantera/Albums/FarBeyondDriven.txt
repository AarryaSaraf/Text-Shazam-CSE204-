// Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills //

I fucked your girlfriend last night.
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.
She called me Daddy.
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass.
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight.
And I slept with her all over me,
from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass.
Sometimes I thought you might be spying,
living out some brash fantasy, but no.
You were knocked out.
But we were all knocked out you know.
In a way

I serve too many masters.

We didn't know you'd break the bottle
that the magic came in to use those jagged shards
to cut our wrists and neck.
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude.
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
because I didn't,
your girlfriend could have been a burn victim,
an amputee, a dead body.
But god damn I wanted to fuck.

I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind,
I serve too many fucking masters.

(I told you. I told you motherfucker)

// Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks //

As a child I was given the gift to entertain you.
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you.

I drink all day. I smoke all day.
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.

You know it's bad, some may say sad,
a hangover is inspiration.
Like a junkie I hurt for it.
A bad trip, the emptiness.

I never sleep, or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me.
The big picture.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the Christians mean
to immortalize my situation.

My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

Embrace some religion.
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point.
Simply to thy ghost I cling.
Simply to thy ghost I reject.
Simply to thy ghost I give spit.

Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me.
You know that I'll submit.
For this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you

my soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

// Slaughtered //

One's own Kingman,
Christ person, Woman God.
At battle with a mass astrengent.
The bond that blends the weak to the wise.

It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left

slaughtered.

Brainwashed by me.
Myself influence I.
Bird brained
World saver.
A fake god rests dead inside you.

It's a safe assumption
that you'd want to save me now.
But I'll never face castration.
For your sacred sow is left

Slaughtered.

System destroyed. Exposed and unployed.
The fruit of intention
cry for their dead, but turning their head
to ignore reality's claw.
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm
is your ounce of prevention.
Give what you made,
And under your name on your grave, is salvation.

A big fucking joke.

Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king
for your own restoration.
God is in your chest  and faith kills what is precious,
for death is unanswered.

Slaughtered.

Do sin [x4]

// 25 Years //

I vent my frustration at you old man,
after years your ears will hear.

You screamed you tried,
it's words of a weakling
and promises made by a liar, drunken liar.

Now you pick up that splintered chair,
that was aiming for your head.

A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me.
Alone.

I won't lose a second of sleep for this...

Don't touch me.
No!
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

Orphaned to the dope and drinks,
I learned my lesson well, somehow from you.

No tears. Can't clutch my regrets.
But these years of detachment
have left me with demons now surfacing.
I'm becoming more than nothing.

You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence.

But now you don't have to dump me off,

Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!

Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Fuck, no!
Don't touch me
Never again

I vow, lest I die tomorrow...

You'll never be the father I am.
The bastard father to the thousands
of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted.
The ones with fathers just like you.
We're fucking you back.

I'm shoving my life right down your throat.
Can I find the guts?
Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up,
does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?

We're fucking you back
Fucking you back
We're fucking you back
Fucking you back

// Shedding Skin //

I don't want you to look at me while
I'm shedding skin.
I can't afford for you to see what's in.
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me.
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.

I was betrayed, one more day of my short life.
You were carried away. You had no shame.
To suffocate my being.
I was me, but you weren't you.
You were sticking to me like a scab...
so I peeled you away, and bled for days.
Then stepped out of myself.

I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.

I don't think you belong in here,
I feel I'm sick.
Don't ask because you know damn well where I've been.
I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin.
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin.

I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life.
Strangling back. Seething black.
In between my longing for torture.
Blood on my face that came from your face.
The mix of kissing and bleeding.
I put you away. I shut you away.
I pissed you away. I threw you away.

I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.

You're fucking, and sucking.
You're friendless. It's endless.
Your flower has soured.
It's endless. You're friendless.
It's harder. And stronger.
But no one's been inside you longer.
Or harder. Or deeper.
To get you off, you need the fear.

It's never love. Bloody touch.
Broken wrist. Needle rust.
Choking throat. Swallowed teeth.
Head fuck. No peace.
I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
You've got to love me.

Ornament. Shrunken head.
Playtoy. Snake strike.
Poisonous. Syphilis.
Drenched me. Soaked me.
I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.
You've got to hate me.

// Use My Third Arm //

Enlight your sense of thought, of touch,
of real, a shield, an underground for this coward.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like some raping,
without judgement.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Serve and protect you.
His dick his gun, his brain his badge.

A faster way to kill them all would take too goddamn long.
Absorb through pores the great escape.

Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.

Ourselves.

Arm yourself. A branch. A third arm.
Extend your health, crawl inside euphoria.
Building a blood in water scent.
It's like a scraping. It's entrapment.
Boy in a pocket.
Balls in a bag.
Perverted handle.
His getting by is a fisted fuck.

A faster way to exterminate them takes too fucking
long. Absorb through pores the great escape.

Kill that fuck to show him up.
Equal his displeasure now.
Stab his ass, a reminded past of what the fuck we live for.

Ourselves.

Half-assed for most his life.
Piss poor little ham.
Narc boy a fake fuck limp dick.
Sucking up to the man.
And the world.
We need a fucking cold war.

Building a blood in water scent
It's like a raping
Without judgement
Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag
Perverted handle
His dick his gun, his brain his badge

Kill that fuck to show him up
Equal your displeasure now
Stab his ass a reminded past of what the fuck we're living for

Our fucking selves!

// Throes Of Rejection //

This is feeding what I am.

It's like salt poured into a deep, infected wound.
It's the type of pain you really dig and long for.
I've always been insecure to open up and show love.
Some pretty girl with long hair, some bald guy writhing.

rejection...

The kind that's self induced.
The tongue that's bitten through.
The nauseating stab.
Is feeding what I am.

A short fuse.

If there really is a god, then it's punishing me constantly.
She let me taste that sugarhole and of course, I wanted more.
But no. I'm reduced to a Rottypanol snort and a lot of drinks.
This shit goes on and on. Just look down my pants.

Rejection...
It ain't a fucking game.
My human dick to blame.
A sociopathic plan.
Is feeding what I am.

Rejection...
Takes life away from eyes.
Will give you to the skies.
It makes me more than a man.
Is drowning what I am.

// Planet Caravan //

We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs

The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night

The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night

And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the universe

// The Badge //

Young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop
What makes a person want to be a cop
Ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

Pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed in the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
You make a play for his gun
They'll kill you say it was a riot
RIOT

What's behind the badge?
