// Ride My Rocket //

In this day and time of metal magic
We need rock and roll
We need PANTERA

I didn't wanna touch you
Since we were both sixteen
Didn't wanna take you down
And show you what love means
Now is the time
This is the place
Get ready to take a chance
We don't have a minute to waste

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough

You leave me breathless
When you walk by
The way you move it girl
Makes you satisfy
You might be the best
That I've ever had
It's gotta be good girl
Cuz it looks so bad

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough

Feels so good
Makes my heart break
Every time you touch me
I explode into flames

Ride my rocket
Wear me out
Ride my rocket
Make me twist and shout
Ride my rocket
Give me all of your love
Ride my rocket
I just can't get enough

// Tell Me If You Want It //

[Interpretation I]

I know you need me,
You know, your the one you've been looking for

Sometimes, it don_t seem right
Your not alone, you need someone
to try, you have to make it by

Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)
Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it

Your the one, in my dreams
Were making love
Laid back in my cool breeze

Sometimes you feel so wild
I'm on the look
You need someone to try
You gotta make it by

Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)
Oh, tell me if you want it
(Tell me if you want it)

[Interpretation II]

I know you need it baby
You know you're what i've been lookin' for
sometimes it don't seem right
you're all alone
you need someone to hold you tight
call me i can make it right
ohhhhh

ohhhhh
tell me if you want it
Late at night
in my dreams
we're makin' love
laid back in my limousine
ohhh
your touch, it feels so right
i'm all alone
i need someone to hold me tight
call me, i can make it right
ohhhhh
tell me if you want it
ohhhhh
tell me if you want it

if you want it girl
you need it so bad
i'll give it to you like you've never had
ohhhhh

// Biggest Part Of Me //

Babe
I need you again
it's getting late
i'm getting high
please let me in
Love
i give you all my love
i just need someone to hold on to
won't you let me in
Girl
you're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?

Another lonely night
back in silent town
thinkin' of ways to get you back
in my arms
Lovein' me all the love you can give
but you've got to go
i just can't live
another day
there's no other way

Girl
You're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?

It's a lonely night
feels like i'm dying inside
all i need is one more chance before I
lose my mind

[*guitar solo*]

Girl
You're the biggest part of me
I need you back in my arms
Girl
You're the biggest part of me
How long will you leave me out here
in the dark?

// Metal Magic //

When they say don't look back
Do what they say
You gotta look ahead
To a better day
In a world of metal magic
You need a break
Go forth
Take a chance
Make no mistake

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic

They say you can't go back
Oh so true
When you're a rocker baby
You gotta pay your dues

In a world of metal magic
Magic never ends
Sometimes you lose
And sometimes you win

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic

Lost in the metal magic
It never ends
Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you win

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Yeah

// Nothin' On (But The Radio) //

She looks easy
a real lady
she knows what i need
she's kinda easy
she's everything you ever wanted in a girl
i'm in love with the way she walks
and i'm not the kinda guy who talks
late at night she gives it everything that she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
late at night, that's the only way to go
nothin' on but the radio
she loves dancin'
slow dancin'
walk me away
sweet romancin'
that little girl
she knows how to satisfy man
i love her every way
tell her what i need
she'll always do ya
and always say please
oh that lil girl she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
nothin' on but the radio

when i feel the way
that i feel about you girl
so easy
when i'm feelin' the way that i do
you're likely to know
whoa

She looks easy
a real lady
she knows what i need
she's kinda easy
she's everything you ever wanted in a girl
i'm in love with the way she walks
and i'm not the kinda guy who talks
late at night she gives it everything that she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
late at night, that's the only way to go
nothin' on but the radio

// Sad Lover //

Alright
Yeah
Whoa
if you want love
don't come to me
i'll be the last to give you sympathy
i've got my ways
under the covers
i'll be the last to be your back door lover
don't you cry now
not around me
baby i don't need that kinda company

sad lover
Queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need

You got your ways
and i've got mine
i tell the truth
but you're out there lyin'
face it girl
white ain't black
this time it's over
don't come back

*?something?* as the years go by
don't be a ghost when you finally die.

Sad lover
Queen of hearts misery
Sad lover
you just ain't what i need

[*guitar solo*]

sad lover
queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need
sad lover
queen of hearts misery
sad lover
you just ain't what i need
