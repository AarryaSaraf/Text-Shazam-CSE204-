// All Over Tonight //

It's late, when I see your face, all crapped up in my room
Well all right, well it's taken all night, been searchin' for you
Aw come on, take it down, give me some action, don't wanna see your face
Oh yeah, it's o.k., been drinkin' my whiskey, there's got to be another way
It's all over tonight
It's all over, all over tonight
Action!

Head's swimmin' round and round, it's gettin' under my skin
I'm sayin'. I wanna take you down, I'm gonna do you in
Come on, go down, give me some action, don't wanna see your face
Oh yeah, it's o.k., been drinkin' my whiskey, got to be another way
It's all over tonight
It's all over, all over tonight

// Like Fire //

Don't get in her way, a sharp shooter that never miss
She's comin' on like a hurricane, might burn your finger tips
Her eyes could blow your mind with a look right on the spot
And once she starts, she'll tear you apart, boy she makes it hot
She's

Like fire, she's burning hot, everything she's got
Like fire, tearing up the night, like dynamite
Like fire, spreading through the town, you'll never slow her down
Like fire

She's got everything it takes, to keep you satisfied
She'll get you down, let her hands do the talking, ain't no place to hide
'Cause she's over me and she's under me, she's everywhere I turn
Get on her knees, just a' screamin' to please
Take a chance on gettin' burned
She's

Like fire, she's burning hot, everything she's got
Like fire, tearing up the night, just like dynamite
Like fire, spreading through my town, you'll never slow her down
Like fire

// In Over My Head //

All alone this lonely night
I've been thinkin' about you
And now I'm on my own, just ain't right
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go

I can't take it
I can't make it alone, no

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I can't sleep, I need your touch
Lying here right beside me
I was in too deep, meant too much
Something free that reminds me

I can't take it
I can't make it alone, no

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I keep thinkin' love is gonna find a way
I feel it comin', love will find a way!

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
(Over my head) Oh, without you

I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

Over my head...
Over...
Over...

// Heavy Metal Rules! //

All my life, it's been the same
Too many rules if you wanna play the game
Don't do this, don't do that
Your mom and dad, they know where it's at
I'll show 'em all, a thing or two
I found a game I know how to do
Put on your leather, snap on your spikes
Me and the boys are hot rockin' tonight
I'll stick my fist, high in the air
I'll make a sign, 'cause I don't care
Heavy Metal Rules!

It's the same corruption, everywhere I look
There's a brand new rule inside a brand new book
Some people claim that the devil is loose
They blame it all on the rock 'n' roll youth
That don't stop me, I'm on a roll
I found the noise, bangin' my soul
So take it up, loud as you can
There's just one rule that I understand
I'll stick my fist, high in the air
I'll make a sign, 'cause I don't care
Heavy Metal Rules!

// Only A Heartbeat Away //

I remember the first time your lips met mine
We were young and innocent, we had plenty of time
The years have gone and passed us by, don't run and hide
Think of all the things we had, and what you're feeling inside
Feeling inside

Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away

So close, but so far away
You say you love me, but you can't stay
Hear me now, we're wasting time
Take a chance, loves on the line
Love's on the line

Take me, take all of my love
Take me, I can give you so much
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away
Only a heartbeat, only a heartbeat away

// Killers //

I'm so tough, hear my motor revving up
Who yeah, keep on and take it away
Well hold tight it's Saturday night
Sorry but I just can't fade, no way

We're gonna shake it loose
Party all night
She got my number but that's alright
Killers, runnin' loose

We'll case the whole town
I know she's been around
She's got me running that's for sure
Yeah so knocked up, bad girls lick it up
They got the jump boys
And there ain't no cure

We're gonna
Make it loose
Shake it in the air
Their mamas coming but we don't care
Killers, running loose
Killers, running loose

I'm gonna cut it loose
Show 'em what we've got
Party all night long
Ain't never gonna stop
Thank you
Killers, runnin' loose
And we're killers, runnin' loose

// Takin' My Life //

I can see
I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Oh, my life
Been trying so hard to get it right
Been searching in the night
Trying to set myself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life

No no no
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life

I can see
I know it was meant to be
You can be what you want to be
Just set yourself free

Now I can't turn my back and walk out the door
Now that I know found out what I'm living for

I'm taking my life into my own hands
Got to be strong got to be a man
Takin' my life

No no no
No more no more living in a mystery
I'm not going to let it get the best of me
Takin' my life
