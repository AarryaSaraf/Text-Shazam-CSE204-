// Party Of One //

[Brandi Carlile:]
Waiter, send this to the table, the party of one
The only other lonely soul in this place
And so you're finishing up your coffee
But then where're you gonna run?
Where'd you get that look on your face?

[Sam Smith:]
You should always let the sun go down on your anger
And let it burn you to sleep
And bring it closer to danger
To surrender and retreat
Sing your sad soul to sleep

[Brandi Carlile & Sam Smith:]
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
And I am tired but I am yours

Don't even think about your freedom
Or taking that flight
Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right
Because your eggshells and your "I" statements
And your weaponized words
Are paper tigers now
Oh, your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking
Are making you more and more alone
And girl, you can slam the door behind you
It ain't ever gonna close
Because when you're home, you're already home

I am tired, I am tired, tired
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I loved you the first time I saw you
And you know I love you still
I don't wanna be right anymore
Lord, I don't wanna fight anymore
I'm not taking your side anymore

Oh, I am tired
I am not my own
And I am leaving
And I'm coming home
'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours
I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours

// A Beautiful Noise //

I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

I'm not living to die
Don't stand in a wasteland
Look at me in the eye
Stop living a lie
And stand up next to me
You've got to put one foot in front of another
With a hand in a hand holding on to each other
Go on and rejoice
'Cause you have a voice

It is loud, it is clear
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's calling out the wrong
From the silence of my sisters
To the violence of my brother
We can, we can rage
Against the river
Feel the pain of another
I have a voice

I have a voice
And I let it speak for the ones who aren't yet running free
It's killing me
No one's saying what we need to hear
I will not let silence win
When I see all the pain our people are in
There's no other choice
'Cause I have a voice

It is loud, it is clear
It's stronger than your fear
It's believing you belong
It's for calling out the wrong
From the mouths of our mothers
To the lips of our daughters
We can, we can dream
Like our brothers speaking loud like our fathers
We can, we can heal
Can you hear us?
Can you hear us now?

I have a voice
Started out a whisper, turned into a scream
Made a beautiful noise
Shoulder to shoulder, marching in the street
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
When you're all alone, it's a quiet breeze
But when you band together, it's a choir
Of thunder and rain
Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice
'Cause I have a voice

Now we have a choice

'Cause I have a voice

// Black Hole Sun //

In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguise
As no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stench
'Neath the black
The sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you
Scream again

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind
Tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
And sometimes
Far too long
For snakes
In my shoes
A walking sleep
And my youth
I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings
Like you anymore

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)

Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come?

Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come?

Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)
Won't you come? (Black hole sun, black hole sun)

// Carried Me With You //

You're the soul who understands
The scars that made me who I am
Through the drifting sands of time
I got your back and you got mine

If you bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

From the day it all began
Yeah, you were there, you took my hand
And when I hurt a bit too deep
You watched me as I fell asleep

And when my head was in the clouds
You found a way to pull me out
You picked my heart up off the ground
And it showed me love was all around

Yeah, you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

Oh, we'll be sittin' on the world together (Ooh-ooh)
Watchin' as the days turn into night (Ooh-ooh)
We know how to brave the stormy weather (Ooh-ooh)
And we're never givin' up without a fight

If you should ever bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you
Oh, you carried me with you

// Hallelujah //

Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Well baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah ... hallelujah

// Home //

Think of home
Home
Think of home

When I think of home
I think of a place where there is love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there with the things I been knowing

Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there is love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I have watched it growing

Oh, if you're listening, God
Please don't make it hard to know
If we should believe in the things that we see
Tell us, should we run away
Should we try and stay
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, it's real to me

And I have learned
That we must look inside our hearts to find
A world full of love
Like yours, like mine, like home...

// I Put A Spell On You //

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You better stop the things you do, I tell ya I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'
You know I can't stand it
You runnin' around
I can't stand it
The way you put me down
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

Click Click Boom down the rabbit hole here we go
A whole generation livin' the Truman Show
With no control over the feed we see
Feeding humanity to the machinery
Not only selling ads, they're selling you and me
While slowly hacking our psychology
Tracking what we want to see, who we want to be
Praying on our fragile vanity

The symptoms of oppressive algorithms
Seen in schisms in society
When we're givin' into hidden rhythms
Ridden with the heartbeat of conspiracy
They said the hell with us, they put a spell on us
The greatest trick played on humanity
Is the true price of free our shared reality?

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

// I Remember Everything //

I've been down this road before
I remember every tree
Every single blade of grass
Holds a special place for me
I remember every town
And every hotel room
Every song I ever sang
On a guitar out of tune

I remember everything
Things I can't forget
The way you turned and smiled on me
On the night that we first met
I remember every night
Your ocean eyes of blue
How I miss you in the morning light
Like roses miss the dew

I've been down this road before
Alone as I can be
Careful not to let my past
Go sneaking up on me
Got no future in my happiness
Though, regrets are very few
Sometimes a little tenderness
Was the best that I could do

I remember everything
Things I can't forget
Swimming pools of butterflies
That slipped right through the net
I remember every night
Your ocean eyes of blue
How I miss you in the morning light
Like roses miss the dew

How I miss you in the morning light
Like roses miss the dew

// Open Doors //

So we haven't seen her
Anywhere around
And I fear Brianna
Is six feet underground

And I could not apologize
Enough to set me free
So if you see Brianna won't you
Tell her this for me

I would open doors
Help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
So what are you waiting for
I just want to wish you well
And I don't want to call no more
And I would open doors

Gravity ensures us
Closer to the ground
And I keep my feet planted
Firmly in the clouds

So I would often wonder if you'd
Ever come around
Cuz you're the only one who'd always
Bring me crashing down

I would open doors
And help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
So what are you waiting for
I just want to wish you well
And I don't want to lie no more
I would open doors

So what are you waiting for
I'll help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
I would open doors
Just want to wish you well
And I don't want to lie no more
I would open doors
I would open doors

// Searching With My Good Eye Closed //

Painted blue across my eyes and tie the linen on
And I'm on my way, I'm on my way
Looking for the paradigm so I can pass it off
Is it on my side, on my side?

Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky now?
Searching for the ground with my good eye closed

If I took you for a ride, would you take it wrong?
Or would you make it right, make it right?
I'm looking for a pedestal that I can put you on
And be on my way, I'm on my way

Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky now?
Searching for a ground with my good eye closed
With my good eye closed

Stop, you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop, you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time
If I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way, I'm on my way

Is it to the sky?
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Is it to the sky?
Is it to the sky?

// Space Oddity //

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you?

Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

// Speak Your Mind //

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

There is no greater tool that you have than your voice
And nothing can take it away
You can use it for justice or the freedom of choice
Let no one dictate what you say

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
Of all the wonders, both natural and built
Skyscrapers to mountain peaks
Yeah, none are permitted to silence, you hear
Long live the freedom of speech

Ah-ah-ah

There's a light that shines in the darkness
Let nothing be hidden away
For the power belongs to the people
When there's truth in the words that we say

Give me critics and writers, reporters
Take a hit and open your eyes
Yeah, knowledge is power and the freedom of press
Is the power without taking sides

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
Of all the wonders, both natural and built
And oceans from the east to the west
Yeah, nothing can stop you from pushing the pen
Awh, this is the freedom of press

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

We have heard that there's strength in our numbers
Where we gather our voices are loud
Use the right that you have to assemble
In a peaceful and powerful crowd

We have all heard of walls and division
We should always chose love over hate
There is only one wall built with wisdom
It's the the wall between church and the state

Speak your mind, you're not too young, you know
The future's in your hands
No religion man or leader
Can keep you from this stand
We can always take care of our neighbors
We should gather, report, and be kind
Remember no one can silence the masses
No one can speak you from speaking your mind

Yeah, no one can silence the masses
No one can speak you from speaking your mind

Ah-ah-ah

// Take Me Home, Country Roads //

Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place, where I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Take me home, country roads

// Tie Your Mother Down //

Oooh yeah

Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe

Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact, I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys

But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They can't they understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy

Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight
