You're still alive inside somewhere
Or are you just remains?
You're blood muscle skin and bone
So people cause you pain
But when the skies are crashing down
And when my days are dark and grey
When my fires are burning low
When the life inside me fades
I know that I can count on you
Because you never let me lie
You bring the truth back to me
You bring my back to life

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

There's a place I call my home
Where the sun falls down on me
The light fills in the shadows there
And peace of mind is free
But far below that place
A tear forms in my eye
The shadows have no foe there
And darkness multiplies
I know that I can count on you
Because you've never lead me astray
You bring the truth back to me now
You always light my way

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak

I need somebody strong
For when I'm feeling weak
With an open heart that can listen
For when my soul is too tired to speak
