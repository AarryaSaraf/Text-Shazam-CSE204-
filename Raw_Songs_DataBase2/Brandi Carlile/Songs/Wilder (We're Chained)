You came into this world with eyes as clear as water
You didn't look a thing like your grandmother's daughter
With a heart so heavy and beating like a drum
Yeah, neither did you look like your grandfather's son

We're chained, and when everything changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away, our love will still remain
We're chained

Wilder than a brushfire burns deep inside the bramble
Baby, I think God made your soul born to ramble
Maybe you'll take to the far away places
Where life is gonna deal you a hand full of aces
But it doesn't really matter how great the spaces

We're chained, and when everything else changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away our love will still remain
We're chained

Life has a fuse and it burns with quickness
But death ain't the long twisted branch of sickness
Just as the spark gives birth to a flame
We'll be bound by our love and then the family name

We're chained, and when everything else changes our love will stay the same
We're chained, and when everything else goes away our love will still remain
We're chained
