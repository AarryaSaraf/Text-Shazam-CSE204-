It must have been that day I stopped believing
It must have been that time I broke your door
Well I must have been that way before you met me
It must have been a thousand years or more

When you said no more dime store apologies from you
No more back yard rock stars howling at the moon
It's like the harder you try the bigger the debt you pay
I must have lost it...somewhere along the way

I never meant to cause you so much friction
I never saw how jaded I'd become
I never meant to harbor some addiction
I really wanna turn my head and run

When you said no more dime store apologies from you
No more back yard rock stars howling at the moon
It's like the harder you try the bigger the debt you pay
I must have lost it...somewhere along the way
