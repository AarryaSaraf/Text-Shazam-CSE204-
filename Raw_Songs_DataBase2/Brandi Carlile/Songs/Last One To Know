All along my face 
Something's not right 
Headin' down the lines 
I once believe in things unseen 

Till I was running out of 
Time is a virtue not many 
Of us have the luxury to enjoy 

Unless you think you're 
Free but nothing's guaranteed 
But death and taxes and 
(That should let me down)
I'm so far down today 
I'm so far down 
I'm so far down 

Here on my shoulder in stone 
I can never throw (it) away 
And I'm so angry yet so sad 
I remember when 
(The life ..)
You're so rad you're so rad 
I never amount to nothing but 
But ashes of faith 

(I'm not well)
I'm not brave enough to face the things 
That I know are wrong with my life 
So I blame you 

And you're the first one to go 
The first one to show 
The last one to know 
The last one to know
