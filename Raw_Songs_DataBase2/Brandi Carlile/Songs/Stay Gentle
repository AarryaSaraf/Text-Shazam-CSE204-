Stay gentle, keep the eyes of a child
Don't harden your heart or your hands
Know to find joy in the darkness is wise
Although they will think you don't understand

Don't let the world make you callous
Be ready to laugh
No one's forgotten about us
There is light on your path

Stay gentle, keep the eyes of a child
And wear your heart on your sleeve
Know to find joy in the darkness is wise
Although they will think you are naive

Don't let 'em lower your shoulders
Love 'em more while they try
Grow younger while you're growin' older
Be amazed by the sky

Darling, stay wild if you can (If you can)
The girl with the world in her hands (In her hands)
The kingdom of Heaven belongs to a boy
While his worry belongs to a man

Stay gentle, stay gentle
The most powerful thing you can do
Oh, gentle, unbreakable you
