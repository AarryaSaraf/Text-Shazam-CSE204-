I can never write a love song
I can never write a blue song
When I'm in love I am a lover
And I have always had the blues

I am afraid that no one sees me
What will they say when I am gone
It occurs to me I think I miss you
I think I've missed you all along

Out of the corner of my eye (out of the corner of my eye)
Not sure if I should think these things of you
Is it the wrong place at the wrong time
I think it's just my turn to lose

Thoughts of you could give me smile lines
I laugh myself to sleep because I knew (I knew)
We were talking 'bout a fine line
It depends on who you're talking to

If it's any consolation
The blues have always had me too
And if I ever write a love song
I think I'll write it about you
