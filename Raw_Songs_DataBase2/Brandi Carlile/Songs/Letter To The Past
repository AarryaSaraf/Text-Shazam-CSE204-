It's a game
Baby, it's just a game
And nobody loses when you learn to love the one
Who finally wins sometimes
You'll be wrong
'Cause sometimes, we get it wrong
But nobody leaves here alive
And nothin' holy comes from bein' right

So don't hold your breath like that
Baby, let it go
You're gonna feel it in your back
Believe me, I oughta know

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still bitin' your shakin' hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
But, darlin', I'll be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

You can cry
You know it's always okay to cry
You don't even need to know why
But don't you ever feel alone inside
If you need to know the truth
I still haven't got a clue
If the blind can lead the blind
Then, baby, I'm just like you

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still fightin' your empty hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
But, darlin', I'll be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still hidin' your empty hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
Darlin', I will be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

It's a game
You know it's okay to lose a game
But always remember your name
And have no shame
Because you're built to last
