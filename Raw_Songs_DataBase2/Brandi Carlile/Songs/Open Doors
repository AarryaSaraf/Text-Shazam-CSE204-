So we haven't seen her
Anywhere around
And I fear Brianna
Is six feet underground

And I could not apologize
Enough to set me free
So if you see Brianna won't you
Tell her this for me

I would open doors
Help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
So what are you waiting for
I just want to wish you well
And I don't want to call no more
And I would open doors

Gravity ensures us
Closer to the ground
And I keep my feet planted
Firmly in the clouds

So I would often wonder if you'd
Ever come around
Cuz you're the only one who'd always
Bring me crashing down

I would open doors
And help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
So what are you waiting for
I just want to wish you well
And I don't want to lie no more
I would open doors

So what are you waiting for
I'll help you on your way
I don't want to lie no more
I think I've found my place
I would open doors
Just want to wish you well
And I don't want to lie no more
I would open doors
I would open doors
