Oooh
I sometimes lose my faith in luck
I don't know what I want to be when I grow up
I just count the rain
Wearing the floor through the boards again
I wish I could find a soul to steal
I could be the engine, you could be the wheel
When we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone


Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

I never did learn how to follow the rules
I never was good at sleeping while the moon was full
I just lie and burn
Wreck my mind while the planet turns
I sometimes wish I could start again
I'd try and do the right things every now and then
I'd step in line
That's what I would do if I could turn back time


Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

ooooooooooooh

I tell you how I want to live
Forget about the take
Forget about the give
I want to leave this town
Fake my death and never be found


Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

I sometimes lose my faith in luck
I don't know what I want to be when I grow up
I just count the rain
Wearing the floor through the boards again
I wish I could find a soul to steal
I could be the engine, you could be the wheel
When we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone


Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home
