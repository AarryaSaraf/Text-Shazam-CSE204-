There's a candle in the corner
It keeps reminding me of you
It's how you lit it on my birthday
Sometimes I miss the things you do
But then you'd turn on me if the wind blew
And you'd sting me with a glare
And your thirst was so insatiable
Just to quench it robbed me bare

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees

Cross-legged by the fireplace
I play guitar while you read
My patience ran so thin with you
Always toying with my head
Some how it made you strangely gleeful
To see me longing for your touch
And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees

I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay
C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away
If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain
C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain
And I fall on my knees
All my pride is in your hands
We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans
I taste the shame and I'll take the blame
If it's my cross to bear

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
