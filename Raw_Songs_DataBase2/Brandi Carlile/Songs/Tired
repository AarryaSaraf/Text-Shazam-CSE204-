Up tired with your blue eyes crying and you're
Upset like you're tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think you'll figure out
And even if you've 

Lost your mind when you're down and out
I don't know what you're on about, but,
You'll end up on your own again, hey.

Underlying, self-denying,
Hate when you've been left behind.
The world is closing in on you.

You've been told a thousand times
To watch your back, you never know quite when
Or where.

Up tired with your blue eyes crying and you're
Upset like you're tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think you'll figure out
And even if you've 

Lost your mind when you're down and out
I don't know what you're on about, but,
You'll end up on your own again, hey.

Lost and low, I know, you're okay.
I do believe I'm saving you.

Maybe I don't want to be.
I do believe that it will be okay, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Underlying, self-denying,
Maybe you've been left behind.
The world is closing in on you.

You've been told a thousand times
To watch your back, you never know quite where
Or when.

Up tired with your blue eyes crying and you're
Upset like you're tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think you'd figure out
And even if you've 

Lost your mind when you're down and out
I don't know what you're on about, but,
You'll end up on your own again, hey.
Yeah

Oh, everything will be okay.
