Ooh, ooh, ooh

I know you're leavin' me
I know I'm not your home
You want a movie dancer
You want blood from a stone
But I'm on to you
And you will pour your heart into
Any shimmering fad
Throwin' good after bad

People get addicted to
The rush, the chase, the new
Just hopin' that all that chaos
Will lead to somethin' like this
I'll get over you
But you won't be whole until you do
You won't find what you had
Throwin' good after bad

And I'll always feel a little left behind
But that lyin' wind that calls your name
Will leave you flyin' blind

Are you fantasizin'?
You're takin' us for granted
I know you're bored
You always say I'm heavy handed
You got a beautiful mind
And a soul of a coyote
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad

I know you loved me once
You were somethin' to prove
I was an unfinished song
You were nothin' to lose
I'm a dandelion
And when my color suited you
You allowed me to grow
But you know when you know
And now the party's over
And you're dancin' alone
You've been spinnin' 'round for hours
And the band have all gone home

And you're fantasizin'
You're takin' us for granted
I know you're bored
You always say I'm heavy handed
You got a beautiful mind
And a soul of a coyote
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad

Ooh, ooh, ooh
