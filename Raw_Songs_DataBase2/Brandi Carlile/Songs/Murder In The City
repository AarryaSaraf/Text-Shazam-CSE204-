If I get murdered in the city
Don't go revenging in my name
A person dead from such is plenty
There's no sense in getting locked away

And when I leave your arms
The things that I think of
No need to get over-alarmed
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

I wondered which of us is better
Which one our parents love the most
I certainly get in lots of trouble
They seemed to let the other go

A tear fell from my father's eyes
I wondered what my dad would say
He'd say I love you both
And I'm proud of you in so many different ways

If I get murdered in the city
Go and read the letter in my desk
Don't bother with all my belongings, darling
Pay attention to the list

Make sure my wife knows that I loved her
Make sure my daughter knows the same
And always remember there's nothing worth sharing
like the love that let's us share our name
Always remember there's nothing worth sharing
like the love that let's us share our name
