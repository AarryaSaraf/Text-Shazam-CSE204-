I walked on by the old school yard
As high as I envision
The years behind us and your decisions
Whatever it takes whatever you need
And I will be there for you
Last you heard is I adore you, well
And days go by
But that was yesterday
You want to still be friends
It doesn't work that way

I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud

If time wasn't lost
And the friends you forgot
That tried to be there for you
All you wanted was to be alone
And I can't win
It's over either way
Hey I know how this ends and I don't want to play

I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud

I watched our friendship sink
I held out my hand
You tore another chink
And I didn't understand
Thru all the white lies
Thru all the black lies
Hard to survive
As I held you up
Still your pride you rejected my crutch
I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in
And the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud
