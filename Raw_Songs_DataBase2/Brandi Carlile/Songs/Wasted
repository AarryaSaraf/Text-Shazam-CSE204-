If you had eyes like golden crowns and
diamonds in your fingertips you'd waste it
If shining wisdom passed your lips and
traveled to the ears of God you'd waste it
And so I hate that you're overrated most
revered and celebrated because you'll waste it

Then again it's good to get a call
Now and then just to say hello
Have I said I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go

But ever time you close a door and nothing
opens in its place you've wasted
And when you speak the words you know
to those who know the words themselves
you're wasted
You're such a classic waste of cool, so afraid to
break the rules in all the wrong places

Then again it's good to get a call
Now and then just to say hello
Have I said I hate to see you go
I hate to see you go
