I done some bad bad things
The kind you don't bring up at confession
Somewhere in my life, woah
I took the wrong direction
I swear on my soul
I didn't want to hurt no one
But I got no way to justify
The things I done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

You done some bad bad things
The kind that don't bare to mention
Something inside you died
Now you need some ressurrection
If you don't want to go down
Just like the setting sun
You got to find a way to reconcile
The things you done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

I swear some people in the world
They got no moral compass
I know the wicked ones
I feel them walk among us
The hangman begs for mercy
Only when his time has come
Because he got no way to
Rectify the things he done

If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to atone for my sins
If you're good at telling lies
You could be my alibi
And I won't have to the fall for where I've been

I won't take the fall for where I've been

I won't take that fall for where I've been, no
