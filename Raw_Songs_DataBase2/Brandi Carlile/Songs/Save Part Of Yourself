The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yeah, life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you
And I kind of miss your broken smile

Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

I remember you and me
Lost and young and dumb and free
And unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone

So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me?
Turn to light or fade to black
You don't look back, no, you don't look back
At what you might not wanna see

But save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

The sun goes down and five years gone
Life goes on, yes, life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself for me

Won't you save part of yourself for me?
Save part of yourself for me
