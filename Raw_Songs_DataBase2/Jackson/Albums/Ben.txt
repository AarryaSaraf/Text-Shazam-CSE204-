// In Our Small Way //

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt, we'll be a crutch
When there's thirst, we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care, we love
Enough to share (Enough to share)

Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

In despair, we'll be the hope (Be the hope)
And the prayer that frees the soul (Frees the soul)
We'll be there to share each lonely road (Lonely road)
Because we love, I know (I know)
We care enough, yeah (We care enough)

Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes (Just a little time is all it takes)
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see (We've got)
Love is all we need (We've got love, yeah)

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
(But we still) But we still can change some things today
In our small way

(La-la-la la-la-la-la-la) Ooh
(La-la-la-la la-la-la la-la) Ooh
(La-la)

(La-la la-la la-la-la-la-la)

// Ben //

Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me) 

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there) 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere) 
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go) 

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

Ben, most people would turn you away (Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend) 
Like Ben
(Like Ben) 
Like Ben

// The Greatest Show On Earth //

Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like Ferris wheels and spinning carousels

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Oh, everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on Earth

The fantasy you see is like
A child again through rainbow-colored eyes
Step right up, it's circus time
And get your money's worth of love today

You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on Earth

Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on Earth

Love, love, love
Is the greatest show on earth (Yeah yeah)
Love, love, yeah
Is the greatest show on earth
Love, love, yeah

// Everybody's Somebody's Fool //

Everybody's somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above (To the one up above)

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Oh, it's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

// My Girl //

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh

I love my baby
She makes me feel proud
I'll climb the highest mountain
And say it aloud

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (talking my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl

I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near
But then you drifted away (Drifted away)
After you said you'd always stay (Always stay)
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah (Did for you)

Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I've had no love affairs
For three long years (Three long years)
Remember how I used to care
When you were down? I dried your tears (Dried your tears)
Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you

Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?

// Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day //

Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful
She's so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumblin'
Her world is crumblin'
Because of you, uh uh
One day you'll hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
You gonna send your baby straight to me

I'm gonna give her all the lovin'
Within my heart, oh yeah
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream
You have torn apart, understand me now?
And when she tells you she's crying her last tear
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near

Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day
That's gonna send your baby straight to me

Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah

Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you're gone she'll know
I'm the one to go to her rescue
Maybe you didn't know that man
You're gonna leave her one too many times
And when you come back that
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine

// You Can Cry On My Shoulder //

Just because you know I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna see you in misery
So, come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)
All your troubles to me

Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do, I'll understand
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it's just that I love you
So, come on, baby, come on

You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)

Girl, you've given him all you had
He'd better stop treating you so bad
Come on, baby (Come on, come on)
Come on, oh, yeah

You can cry on my shoulder
Yes, you can, girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
(Bring them to me, girl)
