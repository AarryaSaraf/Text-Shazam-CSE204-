// Cheater //

Ooh
Huh!
Oh!
Get back on me
Ho!

You know I work too hard for this kinda play (Ho!)
I wrote a letter for the ghetto of the CIA (Ho!)
I don't care a jack bone about what you do (Ho!)
Just put your dime on the line, 'cause I own you (Ho!)

Somebody said, "Give up instead on how you feel" (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater (Ooh!)
Do it! What! (Ya got)
Do it! What!
Get back on me

Now you better go and get yourself some attitude (Ho!)
I know your name and the game ends in I.O.U (Ho!)
You're telling me that you're coming to a compromise (Ho!)
You're smiling at me while you're stealing right before my eyes (Doggone it; Ho!)

Somebody said, "Give up instead on how you feel" (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater (Ooh!)
Do it! What! (Doggone it)
Do it! What! (What!)
Get back on me
I can't, huh!
Jack, oh-oh

I hurt my backbone, baby
I start to give it up
Life is an aggravator
Sometimes I part it up
I broke my radiator
I am indestructible
I pray to leave my body
Do not you ever call

I don't care a jack bone about what you do (Ho!)
Just sign your name on the line, baby, I own you (Doggone it)
(Ho!)
(You are a...)

(Cheater) Ooh!
Give it to me, what!
What! Get jack on me

Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater

(Doggone it)

Cheating, baby (Doggone)

// Fall Again //

Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone 
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Because you're always there in my dreams

I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

(All of the time, here in my heart)

// In The Back //

You're just preaching the Bible
And they still speaking "You're a liar"
And you still deal with the fires
That they make get bigger
Dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah dah dah, and you
Dah dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
Dreams don't last forever, oh
Why you wanna fix me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I can't take it

Why you stab me in the back?

We're so gonna lose it
And she, knows that is the deal
She, I
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah, people
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah, did I
Dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
This dude won't last forever
Why you wanna hit me?
Oh, babe
If the police don't take it
God forsake it
I'll fall breaking

Why you stab me in the back?

Why you wanna fix me?
Things don't last forever, oh no
Why you wanna get me?
We should be together
Why you wanna hit me?
We should be together
Why you wanna get me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I won't take it

Why you stab me in the back?

Ow!

// Monkey Business //

Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what is going down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
I don't ever wanna say it
'Cause it's all blasphemy
Everybody is doing it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Oh yeah)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be calling down babe
Said Lord have mercy
Even worse the birthday
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be going down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doing it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (doggone)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It is too much
Monkey business going down

I read the paper
And I can't believe what's going 'round
Somebody is doing it to
Somebody is up, somebody is down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shine with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you
(You are dirty, you are dirty, dirty, dirty baby)
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hee-hee) (Hoo-hoo)
Your brother didn't make it out the two times two
You sitting 'round here telling how he did it to you 
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

(Going down babe)
Monkey business going down
(You are not satisfied baby)
Monkey business going down
(You wanna party)
Monkey business going down
(My business is your business)
Monkey business going down
(I caught your mother she doing a dude
She can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
(And monkey see, monkey do
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business
Too much for the kids, baby
It's a monkey business going down
(Oh, babe... Doggone...)

// Scared Of The Moon //

Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

// Someone In The Dark //

All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
Oh I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!

// Sunset Driver //

(Hoo!)
(Hee!)

All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth, you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)

Feelin' bad, you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth, you're breakin' every law

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)

On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you wanna be?
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Gettin' higher, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)
(Hoo!)
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hee!)

You are there when the night's in town
Standin' there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothin' wrong (Hoo!)

Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the move, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?

Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver, you're a Saturday nighter (Aaow!)

(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah) (Hee-hee-hee)
(Aah) (Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)
(Hoo!) (Hee!)
(Hoo!)

(Hee!)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)

That's it, Janet
That's fine, Michael

// The Way You Love Me //

I was alone in the dark when I met you
Ooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet you
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
Ooh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll see

The world's a better place 'cause you came in time,
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
Ooh

I like the way how you're holdin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
You'll see
Ooh [10x]

// We Are Here To Change The World //

We're on a mission in the everlastin' light that shines
A revelation of the truth in chapters of our minds

(So long, bad times)
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharin' a light brighter than the sun

And congregate, illuminate

Gonna change the world, hee!

Ah, sing it

Gonna change the world, ooh!

(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Deep down in my body
Deep down in my soul, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world
Ooh!

// We've Had Enough //

Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die?
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun

In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?

Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice

Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby

We can't take it
We've already had enough

Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and let God decide
Deep in my soul
It's up to me and I'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

It's going down baby
Just let God decide
It's going on baby
Just let God decide

Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough

You're my lover
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

Oh lord, oh lord
Deep in my soul, babe
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?
Oh no, hold on
Yeah
