// All I Need //

'Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
(We can do it again)

We drove closer, closer and closer
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I'm taking you away
Tonight

Come together all the people (we can do it now)
Here's your chance to make it right (go, take a chance)
And even though we're getting close
We're not there just yet
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I'm taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
I'm always here to stay
(Oh)
Tonight

(I'm always here)
(Oh, my)
(I'm always here)
We can do it again
(I'm always here)

// All In Your Name //

[Barry Gibb:]
Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out how high we can fly

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up

[Michael Jackson:]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game
It's all in your name
Carry me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name

[Barry Gibb:]
Look to Heaven
An angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?

[Michael Jackson:]
Only God knows
That it's all in the game (Oh)
It's all in your name (Oh yeah)
Follow me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name

[Barry Gibb:]
Say the word, and I'll be there
To love you, and understand you
Leave the light on an empty stage
And we'll all know that it's over

[Michael Jackson:]
It's over

[Barry Gibb:]
Then we'll all know

[Michael Jackson:]
It's over

See that it's done
(And it's all in your name)

[Barry Gibb:]
But the soul remains

[Michael Jackson:]
It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same
They're the same (yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name

// All Right //

We can walk away
But I turn my head to see if you would stay, baby
We can love the day
Then I'm hoping that we throw those stones away
Baby, yeah

Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me waiting here?
Now you got me here in tears
Hold me

Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight (Yeah!)
It's gonna be all right
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight (Tell me it'll be all right)
It's gonna be all right (Say it's gonna be just fine)
Everything's just fine
Everything will be just fine

All right

She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart
She is setting me free (She in the dark)
Whispers in the dark (Save me from these thoughts)
Unbreak my heart
You let it fall apart

Please stay this way
Don't you run away
I got a premonition (I used to dream)
Ooh girl, it burns just like the sun

Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight (Yeah!)
It's gonna be all right
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight (Tell me it'll be all right)
It's gonna be all right (Say it's gonna be just fine)
Everything's just fine
Everything will be

Wake me up when all this is new like morning (Like morning)
Girl, your smile always makes me cry
(If you think you're gonna)
Just hold me, kiss me, touch me
(Stay with me tonight)

All right, it's all right
All right, it's all right
It's all right, all right with me
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all right with me
It's all right, all right
It's all right, all

All right
It's all right
All right
It's all right
