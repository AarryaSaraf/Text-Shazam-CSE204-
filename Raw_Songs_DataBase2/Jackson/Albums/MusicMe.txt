// With A Child's Heart //

With a child's heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play

No need to worry, no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear

With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown

Love is as welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way

Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down

// Up Again //

Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed by my side
You make the sun shine

I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time

I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

// All The Things You Are //

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Someday my happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are
Some, some, some, some, day 
My happy arms will hold you
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Yeah yeah, all the things you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
Someday you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
All the things you are, got to be mine

// Happy //

Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand-new
Lost as a little lamb was I, 'til you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
('Til now)

Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
'Til now

Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oehoe Happy

Happy oh yeah Happy

// Too Young //

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go

And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

// Doggin' Around //

You better stop
You're doggin' around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause if you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down

I can't take it much longer
My heart's getting weak
It's not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset
My head's in a whirl
But if you wanna be, yeah
Be my girl

You better stop
You're doggin' around
You know what I'm talkin' about
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't stop
I'm gonna have to put you down

Baby, yes, I do, yes, I do
Gonna, gonna put you down
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
You're doggin' me 
I'm gonna have to put you down yeah

Yes you do, you're doggin' me 
Yes you do, you're doggin' me 
Yes you do, you're doggin' me 
You better stop
You're doggin' me around

// Johnny Raven //

He's born to be wild

Free and untamed that's how I've grown
(He's Johnny Raven)
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
(He's Johnny Raven)
Oh your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)

I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
By and by (By and By)
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says fly

Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep, yeah, yeah
(He's Johnny Raven)
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
(He's Johnny Raven)
But I'm hungry for new thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

Yeah I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
By and by
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye

Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven, yeah, yeah
(He's Johnny Raven)
Yeah, yeah, by and by
(He's Johnny Raven)
Ooh, I'm gonna fly and when you cry
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Part of me is gonna die
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, I'm Johnny Raven, yeah, yeah
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Yeah, yeah, by and by
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I'm gonna fly and when you cry, yeah
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Part of me is gonna die
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)

// Euphoria //

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It is very easy to say

Say euphoria
And you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still

Watch rainbows glow
Rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full of v-vigour and vim
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn

Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthy and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues

Euphoria
Never to feel frustration
How great to give
Love without limitation

Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another

Euphoria, euphoria
That's the new word for heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
Living in love is heaven

Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria

// Morning Glow //

Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due

Morning glow, fill the earth
Come and shine for all you're worth
We'll be present at your birth
Of all things looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all day long (morning glow)
While we sing tomorrow's song (morning glow)
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow it's almost here

Oh-oh-oh morning glow
Oh oh oh-oh-oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow, filled with light
You can make the whole day bright
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
Woo-oooh, wooh-oooh, woo-oooh, woo-oooh

// Music & Me //

We've been together for such a long time
Now music, music and me
Don't care whether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather, we'll fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me
