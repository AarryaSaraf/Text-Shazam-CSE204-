// I'm So Blue //

There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end

She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I'm singin' to keep from feelin' blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

There I am so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can't reveal, I'm holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool

They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I b'n singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me what should I do

All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I'm singin', cryin' helplessly
But I'll keep singin'

Tschada dada dada naa (Oh Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh my my)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on set me free
(Set me free)
(Woh-oh-oh)

Tschada dada dada naa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada naa ('Cos I wanna be free)
Tschada dada dada naa (Hold on, hold on)
Come on set me free
(Set me free)

All I know is

// Song Groove (A/K/A Abortion Papers) //

Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care, if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?
Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child

Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That's all I've known

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(Chh chh - chh chh chh)
(Chh chh chh)

Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak
What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(Ooh!) (chh chh - chh chh chh) (Ooh!)

She could have been grateful
Where will she go?
What will she do
Through the world?

Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child

Those abortion papers

(This paper) (Hee-hee)

// Free //

You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and don't adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Well, obviously, I do
That's why I wanna be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't past the way I do
Because I wanna be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I wanna be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh yeah

Yesterday was when I felt down
I start, try to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I wanna be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I wanna be
Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind blows)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(An' I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
I wanna be

Free, free like the wind blows
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Ooh, my, my, mine)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
Free, free like the wind blows
(You'll be free, now)
(I wanna be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I just wanna be free)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(I wanna be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go - ooh!)
I've got to be free, free, free, free

Ronnie you are so silly!

// Price Of Fame //

I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain

I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
Father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' this way, boy

Hee-hee
Aow!
Do it, ooh!

I like to take some time and get away, then they say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive

Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues

It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (The price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (The price of fame)
So don't be feelin' no pain, boy

// Al Capone //

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her, out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Aaow!
Aaow!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a man is out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Oh-ba-ba)

You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's love)
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Aaow!)

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away? (Aaow!)
Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)

// Todo Mi Amor Eres Tú //

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
Como la brisa tu voz me acaricia y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece tu amor aparece y me hace feliz
Me conoces bien y sabes también que nadie te querrá como yo
Tú me haces sentir deseos de vivir, junto a ti por siempre, tu amor es mi suerte
(Tu voz me llama, tú eres quien gana en mi corazón)
(Porque me has dado algo sagrado con tu pasión)
(Me conoces bien y sabes también, que no puedo vivir sin tu amor)
Y cuando no estás (no hay felicidad), {mi vida no es vida si tú te vas}

[Michael & Siedah (Michael):]
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Pues todo mi amor eres tú)

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
Noche de estrellas, haz que me quiera como a ella yo
(De madrugada, ven que te espera todo mi amor)
Soy joven, lo sé, pero siento que te quiero y sólo vivo por ti
(Me conoces bien) y sabes también, que yo no puedo {vivir sin tu amor}

[Michael & Siedah (Michael):]
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Uh-huh)
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tú

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
(Cambiaremos al mundo mañana)
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
(Y diremos, "Adiós" a la tristeza)
Es mi vida y {quiero estar junto a ti}

[Michael & Siedah:]
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
Cuando no estás, no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
Cuando no estás, mo hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Oh, oh) (Oh, woah-woah!)

// Je Ne Veux Pas La Fin De Nous //

[Michael (Siedah):]
Je ferme les yeux, je me sens fiévreux, sans toi j'ai froid
J'aimerais t'appeler, j'aimerais prononcer, que toi, que toi
Ce que je ressens, personne ne comprend, je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Pour la première fois, je sais que c'est toi, j'ai besoin de rêver, je vais t'emmener
(L'été finira, près du feu de bois, on fera l'amour)
(Blottie contre toi, je te dirai tout bas, tu me rends folle)
(Ce que je ressens, personne ne comprend, je me sens si bien près de toi)
J'en perds ma fierté, (je ne veux plus tricher, la vérité pour moi, c'est la vie avec toi)

[Michael & Siedah (Michael):]
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
(Je ne veux pas la fin de nous)

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
Et dans cet univers, sans toi c'est un enfer, ne t'en vas pas
(Et pouvoir t'embrasser, j'en tremble rien que d'y penser, tout te donner)
Les femmes d'avant toi, ne comptent même pas, {j'ai oublié tout ton passé} (Passé)
(La terre peut trembler), la guerre éclater
(Je supporterai tout), {écoute-moi mon amour}

[Michael & Siedah (Michael):]
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
(Uh-huh)
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
(Notre amour brillera dans ce monde)
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
(Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme)
Pour te dire amour, toujours, {je veux te garder}

[Michael & Siedah:]
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous, je ne veux pas la fin de nous
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
Et si ça stoppe, je crois que je deviendrais fou
(Oh, oh) (Oh, woah-woah!)

[Pitbull:]
Lo-lo-lo-love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide
With the world greatest
You gonna play this
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
Be the latest
Don't delay this
I'm on that, roll it
Making a toast to the king, MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad, let's right

[Michael Jackson:]
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill

All right

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone

You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone, you know

(Shamone, lay on me)
The world is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
Woo! Woo! Woo!
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again...)
Who's bad
Who's bad

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

(Shamone)
(Lay it on me)
P-I-T is B-A-D
Michael Jackson, R.I.P
Catch a chica with a P-Y-T
All off in Paris, ooh, oui, oui
I've been around the world getting off the chain
And ain't nothing changed, Luchando
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
De santo no tengo nada
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo
Mamita, te tengo la came
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
I'm so out of this planet
I speak a third language
Called that moon talk
In four years catch me with a billion, hee-hee
Doing that moonwalk, woo

[Michael Jackson:]
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it - you know it - you know
You know - you know - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
You know, you know, you know it - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Woo!
Who's bad
Who's bad
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - you know
Woo!
You know I'm bad - you know it
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad

// Speed Demon (Nero Remix) //

Hoo!

Aaow!

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matters
I've got to be on time
And nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

Because

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a lead way
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

Aaow!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)

(Speed demon)

Go!
Aaow!

Hoo!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
