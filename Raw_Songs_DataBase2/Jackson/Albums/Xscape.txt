// Love Never Felt So Good //

[Justin Timberlake:]
Dancing
Let me see you move, come on
Dancing
Let me see you move

[Michael Jackson:]
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in and out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

[Justin Timberlake:]
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Ooh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night through the thick and thin

[Michael Jackson:]
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it 'cause

[Michael Jackson & Justin Timberlake:]
Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in and out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

[Justin Timberlake:]
Dancing
Let me see you move, come on
Let me see you move
Dancing
Let me see you move, come on
I said let me see you move

Michael

[Michael Jackson:]
And the night, that is good
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it 'cause

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in and out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in and out baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out of my life, in and out baby
So baby, love never felt so good

// Chicago //

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone and so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never would've thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Whoa, no
Alright
Oh (I'm in love, love)

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)

She tried to live a double life
Loving me while she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (Holdin' her to blame)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She's with me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)

She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said that it would never end
Or tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

// Loving You //

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do

Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hoo

And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, I'll be loving you)
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do ('cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (n'doo doo doo, loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do

// A Place With No Name //

As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
A place without no name
Take me to (Can't believe) a place without (I can't believe) no name
Take me to a place without no name

Whoa, yeah
Don't go, oh

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies, and the birds
And the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

Take me to (Don't go) a place
Without (I can't believe) no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
Take me to (I can't believe) a place without (Don't go) no name
A place without no name
Take me to (See) a place without no name

No, no, no
La, la, la, la, la (La, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (See, a place without)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (I can't believe, I can't believe)
La, la, la, la (I can't believe it)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

// Slave To The Rhythm //

She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Oh)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

She works so hard just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Love, love, love)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

You got to have pride (A rhythm of love)
To give it, want it, do it, baby (A rhythm of love)

// Do You Know Where Your Children Are //

Hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, oh

Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step dad using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock, yeah
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired, I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm out for blood)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna defeat)
Save me

Hee, hee
Hoo, hoo

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Do you know where your children are? (Because it's now twelve o'clock)
Do you know where's your baby? (If they're somewhere out on the street)
Where's your baby?
Where's your baby? (Just imagine how scared they are)

Darkchild
Escape (Ow!)
Escape (Ow!)
Escape

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (Oh)
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you (You)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can't do what I want to
