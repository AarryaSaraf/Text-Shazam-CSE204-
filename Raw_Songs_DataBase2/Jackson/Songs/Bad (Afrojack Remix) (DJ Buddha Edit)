Lo-lo-lo-love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide
With the world greatest
You gonna play this
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
Be the latest
Don't delay this
I'm on that, roll it
Making a toast to the king, MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad, let's right


Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamone
Shamone
Lay it on me
All right


Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life


I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad


Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life


(Shamone)
(Shamone, lay on me)
The world is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
Woo! Woo! Woo!
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again...)
Who's bad
Who's bad


Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life


(Shamone)
(Shamone)
(Lay it on me)
P-I-T is B-A-D
Michael Jackson, R.I.P
Catch a chica with a P-Y-T
All off in Paris, ooh, oui, oui
I've been around the world getting off the chain
And ain't nothing changed, Luchando
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
De santo no tengo nada
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo
Mamita, te tengo la came
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
I'm so out of this planet
I speak a third language
Called that moon talk
In four years catch me with a billion, hee-hee
Doing that moonwalk, woo


You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shamone
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it - you know it - you know
You know - you know - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
You know, you know, you know it - shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Woo!
Who's bad
Who's bad
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - you know
Woo!
You know I'm bad - you know it
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad
