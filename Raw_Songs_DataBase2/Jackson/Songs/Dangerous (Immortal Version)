The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous


One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free


I never knew but I was walking the line (Hee)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee hee)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee)
My baby cried, she left me standing alone (Hee hee)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee) (Doggone)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine


Just open the door, and you will see (Hee hee, ooh)
This passion burns inside of me (Ooh, hoo)
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell
(Keep it in the closet)


Hoo
Hoo
Hoo
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby

Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
You don't, you don't, don't
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous (Dangerous)
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo
