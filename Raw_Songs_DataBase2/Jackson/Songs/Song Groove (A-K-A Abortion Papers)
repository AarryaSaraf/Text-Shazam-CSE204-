Sister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care, if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?
Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you care, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child

Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That's all I've known

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(Chh chh - chh chh chh)
(Chh chh chh)

Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak
What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin

Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers (Ooh!)
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
(Ooh!) (chh chh - chh chh chh) (Ooh!)

She could have been grateful
Where will she go?
What will she do
Through the world?

Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do

Signin' your name against the Word of God
