All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
You know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (Cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask

I walk around I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask
So I can see your face!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I know you!

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want you
If you can't answer
I don't know

Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
Is it me
Is it you
Behind this mask, I ask
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
