Ooh
Huh!
Oh!
Get back on me
Ho!

You know I work too hard for this kinda play (Ho!)
I wrote a letter for the ghetto of the CIA (Ho!)
I don't care a jack bone about what you do (Ho!)
Just put your dime on the line, 'cause I own you (Ho!)

Somebody said, "Give up instead on how you feel" (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater (Ooh!)
Do it! What! (Ya got)
Do it! What!
Get back on me

Now you better go and get yourself some attitude (Ho!)
I know your name and the game ends in I.O.U (Ho!)
You're telling me that you're coming to a compromise (Ho!)
You're smiling at me while you're stealing right before my eyes (Doggone it; Ho!)

Somebody said, "Give up instead on how you feel" (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater (Ooh!)
Do it! What! (Doggone it)
Do it! What! (What!)
Get back on me
I can't, huh!
Jack, oh-oh

I hurt my backbone, baby
I start to give it up
Life is an aggravator
Sometimes I part it up
I broke my radiator
I am indestructible
I pray to leave my body
Do not you ever call

I don't care a jack bone about what you do (Ho!)
Just sign your name on the line, baby, I own you (Doggone it)
(Ho!)
(You are a...)

(Cheater) Ooh!
Give it to me, what!
What! Get jack on me

Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya

Cheater

(Doggone it)
(Jack) (Give it to me)
Cheating, baby (Doggone)
(Huh!)
(Huh!) (Doggone it)
Ooh-ooh
Cheater
Ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh) Cheating, baby
(Oh-oh) Cheating, baby
Oh-oh
Cheating, baby
You are a cheater (Hee-hoo!)
