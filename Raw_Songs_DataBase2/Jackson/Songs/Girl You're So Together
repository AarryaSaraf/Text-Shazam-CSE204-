Girl, you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

There's no tree
That bears fruits as sweet as you, no
Apples, peaches
And cherries just won't do, ooh baby
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you, babe
(Choose you, babe)

Girl your smile, ooh
Is like the month of May, yeah
When you're near me
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah

Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, you're an eye-eye-popper
A real life traffic stopper
A knockout queen
Oh, what I mean is

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you, baby
(Girl, you're so together) Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way)
Oh, girl, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)
Oh, girl, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)
Yeah, yeah, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)
