I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery


There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
'Cause they're hiding everywhere

(Aaaahhh!)

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

Sorcery...Illusions

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I always feel like somebody's watching me


A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never Land, that's the place
A monster, that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing you could fear




All hail, the king has risen
All hail, hail, the king, hail, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, king, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, the king has risen


You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(Ooh hoo, come on, baby)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (Yeah)
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me


The king has risen


What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning
