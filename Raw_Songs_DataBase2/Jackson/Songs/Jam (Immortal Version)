It ain't too hard for me to jam

Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael
'Cause it ain't hard to

It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to (Woo-hoo)
Jam (Woo-hoo)
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you (Woo-hoo)
It ain't too much for me to

Woo
Jam
