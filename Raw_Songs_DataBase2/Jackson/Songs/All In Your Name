Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out how high we can fly

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up


Only God knows
That it's all in the game
It's all in your name
Carry me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name


Look to Heaven
An angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?


Only God knows
That it's all in the game (Oh)
It's all in your name (Oh yeah)
Follow me to the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name


Say the word, and I'll be there
To love you, and understand you
Leave the light on an empty stage
And we'll all know that it's over


It's over


Then we'll all know


It's over

See that it's done
(And it's all in your name)


But the soul remains


It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same (yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same
They're the same (yeah yeah)

It's all in the game
It's all in your name
Follow me through the gates of paradise
They're the same
It's all in your name
