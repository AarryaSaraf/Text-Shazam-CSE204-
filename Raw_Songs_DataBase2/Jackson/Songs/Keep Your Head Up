She's lookin' for a job and to find a place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promisin'
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away

She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside every time her baby cries, no

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
(Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly

We're killin' up the life in the birds and the trees
And we're suckin' up the air in the earth from under me (It's never too late)
I can't even breathe (Just lean)
I can't even see (On me)
Keep your head up, don't give up today
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today

All you need is love
Tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, want it to
Keep your head up

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive

Fly away, fly away, fly away (Keep your head up, tonight)
Keepin' your head up to the sky
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my

Everybody say that time is borrowed
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow

Rise and do it again

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (ho-oh-oh)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly (yeah-yeah)
Keepin' your head up to the sky (I need your love, I need you now)
An' we can just rise up, tell me now
(I need your light from here today, I need you now)
Give me your wings so we can fly

Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today
Keep your head up
The ol' sun's gonna rise on us today, today
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (O-oh-oh)
Keep your head up (I need your love, I need you now)
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today (I need your light from here today)
I need you now
Go 'n shine in this blind old world today, today
Ho-oh-oh
