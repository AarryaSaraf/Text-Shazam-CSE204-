If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For every time I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you

I would get embarrassed
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
