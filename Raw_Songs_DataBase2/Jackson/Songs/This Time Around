Ah, ah, ah, ah!
A-lacka-lacka-lacka
A-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka
Uh, ah!

This time around I never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me, uh (Ah)
This time around you're makin' me sick
Though you really wanna get me, nah, nah, nah
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me, uh, uh
But this time around I'm takin' no shit
Though you really wanna get me, you really wanna get me

He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought (They thought), they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought (They thought), they really had control of me

This time around I'm not gon' get bit
Though you really wanna get me (You really wanna get me, yeah)
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna fix me (Ugh, you really wanna fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
They get people to use me and then falsely accuse me (Accuse me)
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me, you really can't control me, ugh (Ugh, you really can't control me)

He really thought he really had a hold of me, ugh, ugh
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me, ugh, ugh
He really thought he really had a hold of me, uh, uh
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me, uh
He really thought he really had a hold of me (Whoa, whoa, get me and fix me)
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me


Listen, I got problems of my own (Uh)
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone (Uh-huh)
Even in my home, I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be (Uh)
My friends, but they ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean (Uh-huh), I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin', I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm 'a kill a nigga, I ain't joking, Indo smoke got me chokin', (Uh-huh)
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow (Uh-huh)
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door (Uh)
A real set of peoples to watch my back (Uh-huh)
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby {This time around, yeah}
