Fairytale make believe in you
Fairytale make believe in you

Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one
That I've been lookin' for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall

Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile

Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess
I am sure of it

This is love for sure
Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile

When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairy tales are coming true

Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh

(Fairy tales, make-believe and you)
(Fairy tales, make-believe and you)

Cinderella, stay awhile
Don't you go
Oh
