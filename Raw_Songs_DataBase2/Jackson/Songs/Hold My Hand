Than being miserable alone (Hold my hand)

But together we can be alright (Yeah)
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (Ooh, yeah)


{So if you just hold my hand}
(Baby, I promise that I'll do) Hold my hand (all I can)
Things will go better if you just {hold my hand}
(Nothing can come between us if you just)
Hold, (hold my), hold, (hold my)

(And there's no peace inside) Hold my hand
{So why make our lives harder} Hold my hand
Yeah, yeah

'Cause I've been there before
And you've been there before
But together we can be all right (Alright)
'Cause when it gets dark and when it gets cold
We hold each other 'til we see the sunlight (Yeah)

(Baby, I promise that I'll do all I can) If you just, if you just
Things will go better if you just hold my hand, yeah
