My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love


I walked away but I was wrong
{I can't make it another day}
You're the one that makes me strong
{I can't make it another day}
You're the fire that keeps me warm
{I can't make it another day}
How will I get through this storm?
{I can't live another day without your love}
(C'mon now!)
(Hee-hee!)


At night (At night) I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you (Finding you)
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love


I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't make another day without your love)
I walked away but I was wrong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong
(I can't make it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm
(I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm?
(I can't live another day without your love)


Hoo-hoo!
Go, babe!
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo!
Doo-dee-da-da, da-doo-dee
C'mon now (Hoo-hoo-hoo!)


I walked away but I was wrong
{I can't make it another day}
You're the one that makes me strong
{I can't make it another day}
You're the fire that keeps me warm
{I can't make it another day}
How will I get through this storm?
{I can't make another day without your love} (It's just too much for me)

I walked away but I was wrong (It's just too much for me)
{I can't make it another day} (It's too much for me)
You're the one that makes me strong (It's just too much for me)
{I can't make it another day} (Hoo-hoo!) (I can't make it, baby)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it, baby)
{I can't make it another day} (It's just too much for me)
How will I get through this storm? (It's just too much for me)
{I can't make another day without your love} (Hoo-hoo!) (Yeah!)
I walked away but I was wrong
{I can't make it another day}
You're the one that makes me strong
{I can't make it another day}
