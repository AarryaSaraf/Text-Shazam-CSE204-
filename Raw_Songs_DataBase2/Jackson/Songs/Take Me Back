Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go with everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I am on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the problems that I caused you
If it takes my life I will make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me
