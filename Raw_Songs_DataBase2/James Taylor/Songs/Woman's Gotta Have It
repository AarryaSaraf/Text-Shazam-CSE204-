Once upon a time a good friend of mine told me to tell y'all what I say today.
Do the things that keep a smile on her face,
say the words that make her feel better every day.
You bet you better keep on you P's and Q's. If you don't the woman, you can easily lose.
Oh, I had a love, a true love and I lost it.
No one seems to understand about the pain that it cost me.
Woman's got to have it, I believe that I should know,
she's got to know that she's that she's needed around
when you kiss her, you got to make her feel it everyday, boy,
she's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground. Think it over.

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face.
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace.
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word,
but she's got to know that her voice is heard.
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it.
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me.
A woman's got to have it, I believe, she's got to know that she's that she's needed around
when you kiss her, you got to let her feel it everyday, boy
she's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground.

So if you've got a love, maybe you've got eyes to keep her,
you've got to give her what she wants when she wants it
where she wants it, all right, how she wants it,
And every dog gone time she thinks she needs it.
Your woman needs it the same as mine, woman got to have it from time to time.
Woman got to have it. Woman got to have it, that's what I say. Woman got to have it.
