We are riding on a railroad, singing some else's song.
Forever standing by that crossroad, take a side and step along.
We are sailing away on a river to the sea. Maybe you and me can meet again.
We are riding on a railroad, singing someone else's song, sing along.

Time to time, I tire of the life that I've been leading, town to town, day by day.
There's a man up here who claims to have his hands upon the reins,
there are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train.

Oh Lord, we been riding on a railroad, singing some else's song.
Forever standing by that crossroad, take a side and step along.
We are sailing away on a river to the sea. Maybe you and me can meet again.
We been riding, we been riding upon a railroad, singing someone else's song.
