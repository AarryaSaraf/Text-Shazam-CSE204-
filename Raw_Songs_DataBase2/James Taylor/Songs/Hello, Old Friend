Switzerland's vertical landscape crossed my mind's eye just now.
Canada's shoreline has been calling out to me, but it's been too long a time

hello old friend, welcome me home again. Well, I've been away but that's all over now.

Give me a week or two to recapture my cool, I've got stories to tell
about how I snatched the devil's catch and out ran the hounds of hell.

Hello old friend, welcome me home again. Well, I've been away but that's all over now.
Say I can stay for October, now, stay a while and see.

Hello old friend, welcome me home again. Well, I've been away but that's all over now.
Isn't it nice to be home again, over here it's clear. Hello, old friend.
