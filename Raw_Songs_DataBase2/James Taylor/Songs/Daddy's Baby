Daddy's baby, what's got you thinking? What's got you sinking so low?
Is there something I should know, something new to you?

Daddy's baby fussing and fretting, keeping on getting it wrong.
She can only last so long , so sing her a lullaby-bye.
Baby don't like to cry, so sing her a lullaby-bye.
Swaddle and swing her, sing her a lullaby.

She makes her feelings known to me, her every side is shown to me.
And in our time alone, our love has surely grown of its own.
Silent as a stepping stone, silently as the dawn was breaking,
soft and clear and my tears were dry,
and my tears had flown so I called my love my home.
