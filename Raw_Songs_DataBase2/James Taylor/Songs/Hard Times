We've seen some hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy.
An angry man, hungry woman, they're driving each other crazy.
It's so low down, show down, there's nothing else safe to say.
Baby's on the town, baby's looking round, talking about walking away.

Don't let go, got to give it one more chance.
We've got to hold on, loving me may not make much sense.
But I'm gone on you, baby, baby, I'm gone and I want you back again.
I may be wrong for you, baby, maybe I'm wrong, but I love you just the same.

Now, we've got to hold on, got to hold on. We've got to hold on, got to hold on.
We've got to hold on, got to hold on, we've got to hold on, got to hold on.
We've got to hold on, got to hold on.

Hard times, hard times, holding it together ain't always easy.
An angry man, hungry woman, they're driving each other crazy.
We've got to hold on through all those hard times.
