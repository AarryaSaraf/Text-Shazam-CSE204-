Gee it's great after staying out late, walking my baby back home.
Arm in arm, over meadow and farm, walking my baby back home.

We go on harmonizing a song or she's reciting a poem,
owls fly by and they give me the eye, walking my baby back home.

We stop for awhile, she gives me a smile and cuddles her cheek to my chest.
We start to pet and that's when I get her powder all over my vest.

After I kind of straighten my tie, she has to borrow my comb.
It's one kiss then we continue again walking my baby back home.
