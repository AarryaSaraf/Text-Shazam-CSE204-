Oh money, oh money, oh where have you gone?
I need me some money to have me some fun.
Gonna pick up my guitar and write me some hits,
build me some houses and blow 'em to bits.
Gonna furnish them boldly with style and with taste,
generate truckloads of solid waste.

Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail, hangnail.
Have you ever seen a man with a hangnail?
Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail

Oh money, oh money, oh where have you gone?
I need me some money to have me some fun.
Gonna pick up my guitar and write me some hits.

Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail, hangnail
Have you ever seen a man with a hangnail?
Hangnail, hangnail, hangnail

Oh money, oh money, oh where have you gone?
