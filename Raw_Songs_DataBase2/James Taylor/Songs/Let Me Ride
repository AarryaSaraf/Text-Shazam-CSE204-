Hand me down my golden crown and let me ride, don't deny the highway in my soul.
Jump and sing that silver thing that I feel inside, Hallelujah, let that big wheel roll.

It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory.
I'm talking about the coming of the sunshine story.
Set this poor soul free, let it be.

Break these bonds that hold my soul and I'm on my way.
I can't help feeling there's no time to lose.
I done made my mind up yesterday that I just can't stay,
so hand me down my highway shoes.

It's time to give me just a little bit of old time glory.
I'm talking about the coming of the sunshine story.
Set this poor soul free, let it be.
