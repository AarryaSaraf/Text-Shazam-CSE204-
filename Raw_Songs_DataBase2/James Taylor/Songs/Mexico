Way down here, you need a reason to move. Feel a fool running your stateside games
Lose your load, leave your mind behind, Baby James
Woh, Mexico, it sounds so simple, I just got to go
The sun's so hot I forgot to go home, guess I'll have to go now

"Americano" got the sleepy eye but his body's still shaking like a live wire
Sleepy senorita with the eyes on fire
Woh, Mexico. It sounds so sweet with the sun sinking low
Moon's so bright, like to light up the night, make everything all right

Baby's hungry and the money's all gone
The folks back home don't want to talk on the phone
She gets a long letter, sends back a postcard, times are hard
Woh, down in Mexico, I never really been so I don't really know
Woh, Mexico, I guess I'll have to go
Woh, Mexico, I never really been but I'd sure like to go
And oh, Mexico, I guess I'll have to go now
Talking bout Mexico.  Big ol' honkey-tonk down in Mexico
