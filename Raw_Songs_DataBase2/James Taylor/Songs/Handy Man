Hey girls, gather round, listen to what I'm putting down
Hey baby, I'm your handy man
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule, I'm handy with love and I'm no fool
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can

If your broken heart should need repair, then I am the man to see
I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends, they'll come running to me

Here is the main thing that I want to say, I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com, oh they'll come running to me

Here is the main thing I want to say, I'm busy 24 hours a day
I fix broken hearts, baby
I'm your handy man
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's me
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com
I'm your handy man, yeah yeah, yeah
That's me
Comma, comma, comma, comma, com, com
I'm your handy man, yeah yeah, yeah
