My lady don't allow the life I lead, she don't abide by some of the company that I keep.
She takes occasion to criticize, and carry on. I love her so, I just can't stand it no more,
I'm a fool for you babe, don't you know,
mess around momma, I'm a fool for you momma, oo.

I should say, my baby knows that I'm crazy bout her loving.
That's all right, she takes unfair advantage now and then.
She jumps at the chance to tease me with her body.
Lord, I love that thing so, just can't stand it no more, I'm a fool for you babe,
Look around, momma, I'm a fool for you. Have a sweet thing today.
