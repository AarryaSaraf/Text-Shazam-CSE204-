Don't come to me with your sorrows anymore.
I don't need to know how bad you're feeling today.
I declare I've had my share and I've heard it all before.
It's time for me to be stealing away.
Let those rain clouds roll out on the sea. Let the sun shine down on me, hey, hey.

Love has brought me around, love has brought me around, yes, it has.
Love has brought me around, love has brought me around.

When my sky was full of gray and my day was full of blue,
there was nothing I could do to see myself through.
Now my head is full of springtime and my heart is full of you,
goodbye lonely blue, it shall all come true.
Miss November, I detect a frown, close your eyes and turn it upside down, whoa, oh.

Love has brought me around love has brought me around, don't you know.
Love has brought me around, love has brought me around, yeah.

I know you know what I've got to say is an old cliche anyway, so they say.
love has brought me around, love has brought me around.
Love has brought me around, love has brought me around, yes, it has.
