And the light between us which we could not quite extinguish, which we see at dawn burns on.

First day of May, things are beginning, our side is winning, hip hip hooray.
Made in the shade, deep in the shadow, down by the meadow, lie in my arms.

And the moon will rise before our very eyes, we will rise too, I'll be with you.
It's a rite of spring, a horizontal thing, the sweetest sort of dance hidden in among the plants.

Ha ha ha ha, people are laughing, children are singing, come join the dance.

And the walls around us which we kept at such a cost
when we turned around came tumbling down.

Ha ha ha ha, she can't stop laughing, he can't stop singing, first day of May.
