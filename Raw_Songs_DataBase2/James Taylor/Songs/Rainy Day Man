What good is that happy lie? All you wanted from the start was to cry, girl.
It looks like another fall. Your friends they don't seem to help at all.
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small, just look up your rainy day man.

It does you no good to pretend, child. You've made a hole much too big to mend.
And it looks like you lose again, my friend, so go on home and look up your rainy day man.

Now rainy day man, he don't like sunshine,
he don't chase rainbows, he don't need good times, no.
Grey days rolling, then you'll see him, I said empty feeling, Lord now you need him.

All those noble thoughts, they just don't belong. You can't hide the truth with a happy song.
And since you knew where you stood all along, just go call up your rainy day man.

Now simple pleasures they all evade you, store-bought treasures, Lord none can save you.
Look for signs to ease the pain, I said ask again, go on and pray for rain.

It looks like another fall. Your good friends they don't seem to help at all.
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small, just look up your rainy day man,
all I'm asking just to look up your rainy day man.
