Album: ThatsWhyImHere

// That's Why I'm Here //

Person to person and man to man, I'm back in touch with my long lost friend.
Listen to reason and understand and think of me from way back when.
He said, me and Melissa, well we fell out of love. We ran out of luck seems like lightning struck.
I've been thinking of leaving but I can't raise a buck,
James, I'm wondering could I borrow your truck?

I said that's why I'm here. Got no other reason,
that's why I'm standing before you, that's why I'm here.

John's gone, found dead, he dies high, he's brown bread. Later said to have drowned in his bed.
After the laughter, the wave of the dread, it hits us like a ton of lead.
It seems "learn not to burn" means to turn on a dime
and walk on if you're walking even if it's an uphill climb.
And try to remember that working's no crime, just don't let 'em take and waste your time.
That's why I'm here.

This is an IOU, I reckon I owe you one now.
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria, this'll be better tomorrow.

Fortune and fame's such a curious game. Perfect strangers can call you by name.
Pay good money to hear fire and rain again and again and again.
Some are like summer coming back every year,
got your baby got your blanket got your bucket of beer.
I break into a grin from ear to ear and suddenly it's perfectly clear.
That's why I'm here.

This is the part about Kitty and Jim, he loved her and she loved him.
Wake 'em up shake 'em up the middle of the night, got to tell me everything's alright.
He said that's why I'm here. That's right.

// Song For You Far Away //

People around me are at it again. God only knows how they do it.
One to another then back again, something keeps putting them through it.
Me, I've been watching more than fifteen years and it hasn't changed a bit.
People keep talking about a different line but it never seems to fit.

This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.
This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.

Sitting here all alone is bringing it on again, I'm gone again.
Sitting here thinking of you is driving it home again.
This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.
Open the door it takes me back, oh it takes me back.
Mention your name and I'm gone again, oh I'm gone again.
This is a song for you far away from me, far away from me.

// Only A Dream In Rio //

More than a distant land over a shining sea
More than the steaming green. More than the shining eyes
Well they tell me it's only a dream in Rio
Nothing could be as sweet as it seems on this very first day down
They remind me, "Son, have you so soon forgotten?"
Often as not it's rotten inside and the mask soon slips away
Strange taste of a tropical fruit, romantic language of the Portuguese
Melody on a wooden flute, samba floating in the summer breeze

It's all right, you can stay asleep, you can close your eyes
You can trust the people of paradise to call your keeper and tender your good-byes

Oh, what a night, wonderful one in a million frozen fire Brazilian stars
Oh, holy southern cross, later on take me way downtown in a tin can
Can't come down from the bandstand, I'm never thrown for such a loss when they say
Quando a nossa mãe acordar, andaremos ao sol
Quando a nossa mãe acordar, cantará pelos sertões
Quando a nossa mãe acordar, todos os filhos saberão
Todos os filhos saberão e regozijarão

Caught in the rays of the rising sun on the run from the soldier's gun
Shouting out loud from the angry crowd, the mild the wild and the hungry child
I'll tell you there's more than a dream in Rio
I was there on the very day and my heart came back alive
There was more, more than the singing voices
More than the upturned faces and more than the shining eyes

But it's more than the shining eye, more than the steaming green
More than the hidden hills, more than the concrete Christ
More than a distant land over a shining sea
More than a hungry child, more like another time
Born of a million years, more than a million years

// Turn Away //

I open my arms to hold you, you turn away you turn away.
I feel it just like I told you, how can you turn away?
The things that we said last Saturday night, you turn away you turn away,
now you want to throw that away, how can you turn away?
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.

And now your eyes won't meet mine, you turn away you turn away.
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.

And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.
I never want to taste that sweet wine again, how can you turn away?
It was true love, it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea.
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally.

And after this love I'm keeping for you, you turn away you turn away.
I'll dry these tears that I'm weeping for you and take my turn to turn away, yeah.

// Going Around One More Time //

My heart had been broken and I couldn't take no more.
I shuttered up my windows and I bolted tight my door.
Then I took one look at you and I nearly lost my mind.

Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.

Betty was a little heartbreaker, it didn't quite work out.
She did a number on my confidence, I was riddled with self doubt.
I said that's it, I'm through, I quit, then Juanita, she looked so fine.

Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.

'Round and 'round in a circle, it's always the same.
One moment you swear you've had enough, the next you've got to know her name.
All on my own, it wasn't that bad, I was getting by as I could get.
I stopped into a drug store for one pack of cigarettes.
She didn't have a quarter, had to call her cousin Kate
and could I lend her maybe one thin dime?

Now I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.
Yes I'm going 'round going 'round, going 'round going around one more time.

// My Romance //

My romance doesn't need to have a moon in the sky.
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by.
No month of May, no shining star, no hideaway, no soft guitar.

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain.
Wide-awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
'cause my romance doesn't need a thing but you.

// Everyday //

Everyday, it's getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.
Everyday, seems a little faster, all my friends, they say go on up and ask her.
A love like yours would surely come my way.

Everyday it seems a little stronger, everyday it lasts a little longer.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?
Everyday seems a little closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.
A love like yours would surely come my way, everyday.

Everyday it seems a little stronger, everyday it lasts a little longer.
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me? Like I long from you baby.
Everyday seems a little closer, going faster than a roller coaster.
A love like yours would surely come my way.

// Limousine Driver //

Limousine driver, big Cadillac car, rich and famous no matter who you are you are.
I seen a rock n roll rider, I seen a cinema star.
Won't you to roll down the road, roll down the road, roll down the, roll down the road with me?
Want you to roll down the road, roll down the road, roll down the, roll down the road with me.

Deep into the night, blue velvet push, cut glass crystal, I mean it means so much.
Long cool fingeroos, soft tenderloin touch.
Won't you to roll down the road, roll down the road, roll down the, roll down the road with me?
Want you to roll down the road, roll down the road, roll down the, roll down the road with me.

City sidewalk, shining wet with rain, run through the run through one more again.
Run through the jungle, fetch a lady's glove, kicking off a bundle, go on and give it a shove.
Speak up don't mumble, who do you love?

// Only One //

Oh, you are my only one
You are my only one
Well, I'm telling you now
Now you're my only one

I've got two long legs like to carry me
Two sharp eyes to look for the light
I got two strong arms to hold on tight
Two good friends on my left and right
But only one, only one

And you are my only one
You are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Now you're my only one

Now there's only one road before me
Too many turns in the way
Thousands of things to do today
Millions of moments I must admit
But only one, only one

And you are my only one
You are my only one
Well, I'm telling you now
Now you're my only one

Taken for granted and pushed aside
All that it wanted was a place to run and hide
Missing message in a hollow tree
Hidden deep inside a memory

And the memory seems like dreams
Hundreds of hopes in the past
Nevertheless it was never the last
Hold on strong or you fade out fast
And only one, only one

Oh, you are my only one
You are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Believe in me now
Believe in me now
Well, I'm telling you know
You're my only one

Yeah, you are my only one
You are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Now you're my only one

Yeah, you are my only one
You are my only one
Well, I'm telling you now
Now you're my only one

Yeah, you are my only one
You are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Believe in me now

Oh, you are my only one
You are my only one
Well, I'm telling you now
You're my only one

Oh, you are my only one
You are my only one
Don't be leaving me now
Believe in me now

// Mona //

Life's good, friends are hard to find and now one of mine is dead.
And things I should have said to her, I shall say to you instead.
Mona, Mona, so much of you to love, too much of you to take care of, Mona, Mona.
You got too big to keep and too damn old to eat.

When you where just a football at your mama's side,
I reckon everyone figured you for a barbecue when you died.
And here I'm thinking about you lying underground pushing up a pine tree in my field.
Oh, Mona, Mona, you can close your eyes. I've got a twelve-gauge surprise waiting for you.

Since the day she passed away, everything's just the same.
Everywhere I go, somebody mentions her name.
Sometimes it's easiest to tell a friend a lie, they don't understand the way I feel.
Oh, Mona, Mona, so much of you to love, too much of you to take care of, so long.

Now she is gone and I am left alone as you can see.
But ever since I caused her death, I do miss her company.

// The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance //

When Liberty Valance came to town, the women folk would hide, they'd hide.
When Liberty Valance walked around, the men would step aside
because the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

From out of the east a stranger came, a law book in his hand.
A man, the kind of man the west would need to ease a troubled land.
because the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall.
The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance, he was the bravest of them all.

Now the love of a woman can make a man stay on when he should go, stay on.
just trying to build a peaceful life where love is free to go.
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return that fateful night, that night.
when nothing she said could keep her man from going out to fight.
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Out in the sun, two shots rang out, the shots made Liberty fall.
The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance he was the bravest of them all.
