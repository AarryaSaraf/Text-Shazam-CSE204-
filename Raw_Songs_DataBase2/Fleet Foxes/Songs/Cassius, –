Past my window, out in the street
Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue, the useless sirens scream

Song of masses, passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire
Blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I, out into the night
Held within the line that they have drawn



As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?



I walked home, no words to say
Cassius, one month gone on his way
And who will lead us
And who remains to die?
By a thread, drop my head to cry



As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
