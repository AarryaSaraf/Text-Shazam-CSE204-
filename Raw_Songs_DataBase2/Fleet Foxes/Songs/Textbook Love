I was in the classroom after school
Working on the chalkboard once again
You were in your uniform standing by the door 
When I saw you, saw you there

You were wondering if I'd walk you home 
Even though I lived on the opposite side
I said, "Sure, I don't need to be home soon anyway, anyway."

Textbook love 
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

I started to wear my dad's cologne
Started combing my hair to the side
Anything that I could do 
Just to keep your attention on me

But I was just a phantom passing by
When you where on the track home with your friends
I was nobody at all
I just needed an answer, baby

Textbook love 
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

Textbook love,
You were the girl I was dreaming of
Hold my little hand, baby

Never will I know what you saw in me
But surely you knew exactly what I saw in you
Thinking back now, I'm sure that was the only attraction, baby

Textbook love in the textbook style
Textbook girl with the textbook smile
Textbook love, when I was on my way to redemption, baby

Textbook love
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

Text book love
You were the girl I was dreaming of
Hold my little hand, baby

Lord, it's a shame, I know
Thinking of how it could go
Hold my little hand, baby

Lord, it's a shame, I know,
Thinking of how it could go
Hold my little hand, baby
