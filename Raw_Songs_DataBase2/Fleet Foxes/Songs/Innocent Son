You left me there
Waiting at the bottom of the stairs
With my eyes closed
Holding my right hand in my left

There is no time for
Hesitation now
You come or go
Or go

Rust suddenly falling beside me
On a ghost of a morning 
Riding in sorrow to the harbor 

Far behind, oh me
The bodies of my friends
Hanging alone
Alone again

Some twisted thorn
Tells me you saw me in the night with another
Keep all my promises to break them

I am no, oh no
Innocent son
You run
Rabbit run
