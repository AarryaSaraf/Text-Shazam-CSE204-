New day rising, come close the blue blinds
I'll be lying in my ocean of time

I could dress as Arthur Lee
Scrape my shoes the right way
Maybe read Ulysses
But it's a young man's game

Dying fire, so tired of this place
Not inspired, can't keep to this pace

I could worry through each night
Find something unique to say
I could pass as erudite
But it's a young man's game

You should know
You're my last hope

I've been solving for the meaning of life
No one tried before and likely I'm right

Not too straight or too clean
Like your borrowed blue bike
I've been a rolling antique
For all my life

You should know
You're my last hope

I've been lucky as sin
Not one thing in my way
Just the arena I was in
But it's a young man's game
