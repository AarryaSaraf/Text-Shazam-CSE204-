Ooh, ooh, ooh

Water, winded, and remote
In my crater where I'm hid
I can see a line of smoke
On the other ridge
Though it's a long way

There's an ocean on the line
In it empty and it dream
There's a sun above a sky like I've never seen
A sun above a sky like I've never seen
And I need to let the sun give it meaning
This time, time, time, time

Woo woo woo ahh

And I can hear you through the stand
When I found her where I'm led
Locked in memory I ran, am I so condemned
To a mind that demands that the body rents
And am I given evidence that it might end
This time, time, time, time

Days ebb as tides
As I trace some peace
May the maze of my life
Lead me out serene

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
