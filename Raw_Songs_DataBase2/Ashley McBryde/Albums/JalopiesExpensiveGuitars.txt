Album: JalopiesExpensiveGuitars

// Intro //

Will you come to the fountain free?
Will you come just for you and me?
Thirsty soul, hear the welcome call
Here's a fountain open for all

// Redemption //

I write songs that feel good, I write songs that hurt
I've been known to turn a honky tonk into a black baptist church
Amen

I know sin by his first name, I know salvation well
You can say I saw the light in the flickerin' flames of hell

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption to go around

I don't call myself a prophet, I can't say that I'm a saint
But I've been down to the crossroads, I've seen things that must folks ain't
And I know the devil can't do much evil, if he's too damn drunk to stand
My angels got they hands full, I help the only way I can

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption to go around

Whether it's a one room tavern bar stool, or a little white church house pew
I find the faith, I fight the way, my Jesus wants me to
Me & God are good, despite all the wicked things I've done
If He'll save this back-slidin' bastard, then brother believe He'll save anyone

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
And I can't drink it all by myself
Bow your head, fold your hands
Gonna drink all the way to Glory Land
I got a bottle of redemption

// Lookin' For A Buzz //

Begging the crowd on a Tuesday night
I was having my usual on ice, when you walked by
One hour, two drinks and three shots later
I talked you into having one tailgater in the parking lot
Then it started getting hot

I just wanted a high from your whiskey-sipping lips
One time, no strings, no promises
And you were looking to good not to touch - not to touch
Who knew you'd make my head start spinning
Faster than anything I pour in this cup
I wasn't looking for love; I was just lookin' for a buzz

Little drops dripping off a cool Mason jar
Summer heat melting both our hearts, here in the dark
How'd it get this far?

I just wanted a high from your whiskey-sipping lips
One time, no strings, no promises
And you were looking to good not to touch - not to touch
Who knew you'd make my head start spinning
Faster than anything I pour in this cup
I wasn't looking for love; I was just lookin' for a buzz

I just wanted a high from your whiskey-sipping lips
One time, no strings, no promises
And you were looking to good not to touch

Who knew you'd make my head start spinning
Faster than anything I pour in this cup
I wasn't looking for love; I was just lookin' for a buzz
Lookin' for a Buzz

// Better On The Water //

Tank top, twist top, flip flops comin' off
Sunblock, boombox, pick a song, get it on
Sun drop rollin' like Shiner Bock, load it up
Oh styrofoam, solo, keep the food, keep it cold
Fishin' pole, grab a hold of anything that'll float
Let's go, gotta roll, cold beer's heatin' up

Cut-off blue jeans and tan bare feet
Got more butts than we got seats

Hey y'all, let me hear you holler
Yeehaw, take another swallow
This boat ain't gonna rock itself
Let's have more fun than we oughtta
And take this party out a little farther
Keep this buzz floatin', hey hey
Everything's better on the water
Everything's better on the water

Monday funday, celebrate a holiday
Every day's a good day, catchin' rays, makin' waves
Let's make this lake party play some belly up
Callin' all redheads, brunettes, blondes with hot friends
Rednecks floatin' that beer on a life vest
Sea-Doo, pontoon, that's cool, tie it up

Anchor down any troubles if you got 'em
Watch that sucker sink straight to the bottom

Hey y'all, let me hear you holler
Yeehaw, take another swallow
This boat ain't gonna rock itself
Let's have more fun than we oughtta
And take this party out a little farther
Keep this buzz floatin', hey hey
Everything's better on the water

Hey y'all, let me hear you holler
Yeehaw, take another swallow
This boat ain't gonna rock itself
Let's have more fun than we oughtta
And take this party out a little farther
Keep this buzz floatin', hey hey
Everything's better on the water

Hey yall, yeehaw
Everything's better on the water
Everything's better on the water
Hey yall, yeehaw
Everything's better on the water
Let's keep this buzz floatin', hey hey
Everything's better on the water

// What If We Don't //

This is the part we call it a night
You get into your car, I get into mine
You're thinkin' 'bout me, and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
We can go home alone like we always do

But what if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

There's always the fear of goin' there now
Things gettin' weird if it don't work out
'Cause this kinda thing can't stop once it starts
We might end up breakin' each others hearts

But what if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

I don't wanna over think it
I wanna kiss you right now
Baby I'm done thinkin' about

What if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

What if we don't?
What if we don't?
What if we don't?

// Bible And A .44 //

He had a Southern draw like a red-bone hound
Every song he sang was my favorite sound
He'd be the last one off if the ship went down
Kinda man it feels good to be around
Kinda man it feels good to be around

Had hair as white as a cotton field
And he could spin you a story like a wagon wheel
Never went nowhere without a rod and reel
Lord I miss that man and I always will
I miss that man and I always will

He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more

Said take what you've got and do the best you can
Best thing you'll ever own is a piece of land
Y'all he knew his like the back of his hand
He was something else, my old man
He was something else, my old man

He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more

Saw him strum this thing every chance he could
And he left it to me like he said he would
If you ask me why it sounds so good
It's cause I'm holdin' more than strings and wood
I'm holdin' more than strings and wood

He'd see through a lie like an old screen door
He taught me how to hunt and how to love the Lord
He carried a bible and a .44
And they just don't make 'em like that no more
No they just don't make 'em like that no more

// Fat And Famous //

Frizzy hair and glasses
At the back of the class
You made fun of me on Friday nights
I was down there in the band
You were up there in the stands
And now who's voted 'Most Likely to Hate Their Life'

You got fat, I got famous
Ain't that funny how it changes
You made fun of me for years
I get paid to play my songs
I got a headline gig in Austin
You got a closet drinking problem
And a juvenile delinquent
Souvenir from Senior Prom
I got a Budweiser endorsement
You're re-financing your mortgage
How's it feel to make those payments?
You got fat and I got famous

You cheated off my papers
And ignored me in the hall
Drove a daddy's money Mustang around town
I drove a rusty pile of tin
That you loved to go by me in
It looks a lot like that heap you're driving now

You got fat, I got famous
Ain't that funny how it changes
You made fun of me for years
I get paid to play my songs
I got a headline gig in Austin
You got a prayer-chain gossip column
And a pack of crappy friends
And an ass just like your mom
My guitar player says I'm sexy
I strum his Tele, when he lets me
It's a bitch the way life changes
You got fat and I got famous

You know it's nice to sing about the truth every now and then
Truth is; karma and gravity
Yeah well, they're the same thing

I got a Budweiser endorsement
You're re-financing your mortgage
Ain't that a bitch?
The way life changes
'Cause you got fat and I got famous

// Luckiest S.O.B. //

No, I don't make much money; I'm crazy, I'm told
They pay me to play, and I put on a show
I just do what I love, and I live on the road
And I'm the luckiest son of a bitch that I know
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch that I know

I've got a few real good friends; they're all rockstars
They all drive Jalopies and play Expensive Guitars
I don't have to drop names; we know who we are
And I'm the luckiest son of a bitch in this bar
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch in this bar

Raise your glass, raise your bottle
Cause the good old days won't last for sure
We may all be gone tomorrow
But we can't let the songs go unheard
Oh, I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth

All the best ones are gone now; they're deep in the ground
They paved the way before we came around
And all I hope you say when you lay me down
Is there goes the luckiest son of a bitch in this town
That's the luckiest son of a bitch in this town

Oh, raise your glass, raise your bottle
Cause the good old days won't last for sure
We may all be gone tomorrow
But we can't let the songs go unheard
Oh, I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth
I'm the luckiest son of a bitch on this earth
