// (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction //

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
But I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And the man comes on the radio
Telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I'll say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, but I can't get no

And when I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Oh, but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
But I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm riding 'round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me, "Baby, better come back, maybe next week"
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I'll say

I can't get no
I can't get no
I can't get no
I can't get no
I can't get no
No, I can't get no
I can't get no, no, no, no
Can't get no, can't get no
I can't get no, I can't get no
I can't get no
Yeah

// Light On In The Kitchen //

Always check the door before you lay down
Keep a glass of water by the bed
A dose of local honey
Will keep your nose from runnin'
Little things like that she's always said

Never back up farther than you have to
Pray for those that don't have a prayer

Honey, trust yourself
You better love yourself
'Cause 'til you do, you ain't no good
For anybody else
And, honey, boys are dumb
But you gonna find your one
Love him hard and bless your heart
You'll need someone to listen
That's why I leave a light on in the kitchen

Pancakes just taste better after midnight
When you make friends, always be color blind
Your freckles make you pretty
There's more to life than bein' skinny
When you feel fat, it's mostly in your mind

So, honey, trust yourself
You better love yourself
'Cause 'til you do, you ain't no good
To anybody else
And, honey, boys are dumb
But you gonna find your one
Love him hard and bless your heart
You'll need someone to listen
And that's why I leave a light on in the kitchen

(Ooh, ooh)

Well, honey, trust yourself
Laugh at yourself
If somethin' tries to hold you back
Get up and give it hell
And for heaven's sake
Always have a place
That you can do some cryin' and some bitchin'
And always leave a light on in the kitchen

// Rattlesnake Preacher //

There ain't enough water in the river to wash me clean
After all the dirty deeds I've done and seen
Sins like mine don't come out easy
Ain't enough water in the river for the lord to forgive me

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama

Knew the good book real good
Knew the bad all too well
Spend his life rattlin' cages
And runnin' that devil's ass back to Hell

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was

He was all fire and brimstone
Firewater on his breath
Spittin' 90 proof of truth to a tent full of sinners
'Til there wasn't one single unsaved soul left, son

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was

Told my boy all 'bout his pap-paw
And how he learned how to chase the devil away
Some day I lay a rattlesnake down
And he's gonna pick it up, shake it at the sinners and say

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was
Like his daddy before him

I sing, yes
Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
My daddy told me so

// Second Night Alone //

Left him at the terminal and slowly walked away
'Cause I don't think that I could stand to watch him board that plane
Goodbye shouldn't heart so bad, but in Memphis, Tennessee
It did while I watched him walk away from me

And tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down

I unlocked that door tonight knowing you're not there
For at least a couple hours, I'll act like I don't care
Just turned on the radio and they'll probably play our song
And I'll go on this evenin' actin' like there's nothin' wrong

And tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down

Couple more "I love you"s and one last goodbye kiss
So much about you that I love
So much I'm gonna miss

Tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down
It's tomorrow night alone
That's gonna break me down

// Straight Tequila Night //

If you really wanna know, she comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K13 is her favorite song
If you play it, you might have a chance

Tonight, she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly and fun lovin' most of the time

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' 'bout him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

Here's a glass of Chablis, some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down

Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back and see her again

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' 'bout him and then she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

// The Devil I Know //

A little outside of Elizabethtown
There's a little bar where I'd sit down
And trade a couple country songs for Kentucky Bourbon
A little ol' gal in the middle of the night
Learning how to love and learning how to fight
And learning how to like my brand of hurting

Hell there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

I love somebody everybody loves
And he's in love with my messed up
Most folks can't see my soul through the smoke
And we're suitcase marks on a hard wood floor
Flipping the bird and slamming the door
And peeling out and turning round and coming home

But hell there's hell everywhere I go
So I'm sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
There's higher roads than I rode
And better choices than I chose
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
So I'm sticking with the devil I know
