Album: GirlGoingNowhere

// Girl Goin' Nowhere //

Don't waste your life behind that guitar
You may get gone, but you won't get far
You're not the first, you won't be the last
And you can tell us all about it when you come crawling back
That road you're on, just winds and winds
You're spinning your wheels and wasting you're time

But when the lights come up
And I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am
I hear the crowd
I look around
And I can't find an empty chair
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere

I get these calls, out on the road
Heard your song on my radio
We always said you'd make it big
And I tell all my friends, I knew you back when
So don't forget all us little folks
And when you crash and burn
Remember we told you so

And then the lights come up
And I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am
I hear the crowd
I look around
And I can't find one empty chair
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere

I need to thank my daddy
For that first set of strings
And all those folks who swore I'd never be anything
It took a whole lot of yes I wills and I don't care
A whole lot of basement dives and county fairs
To this show right now and y'all sure look good out there
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere
Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere

// Radioland //

We had one country station
You could drive and listen
All the way to Water Town
Mama kept oldies
Playing in the kitchen
Turned up just a little too loud
Daddy was a rockstar
Riding on a tractor
Listening to Townes Van Zandt
I was 5 years old
With a hairbrush microphone
Growing up in Radioland

Whoa, Radioland
Just the other side
Of a dashboard light
There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland
Yeah!

Catch a Friday night game
Or a Sunday sermon
In the cab of a Chevrolet
Casey Kasem and an old Panasonic
Counting down my Saturday
Mix tape Valentine
Love cuts like a knife
I wanna hold your hand
Well I got my first kiss
I got to first base
All thanks to Radioland

Whoa, Radioland
Just the other side
Of a dashboard light
There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland

Buy a guitar
Learn a couple songs
Find some buddies
And start a band
Get on a bus
Try your luck
Out here in Radioland

Radioland, Radioland
Radioland, Radio- Johnny and June
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland, Radio- Jack and Diane
Radioland, Radioland
Radio, radio

There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Out here in Radioland

Radio... Radioland
Radio...

// American Scandal //

Checking my lipstick in your aviators
Like a couple of cool kids, the hit paraders
The cherry glow of your cigarette

Don't tell me the world couldn't handle
A good old-fashioned American scandal

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain't mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby, kiss me, like you don't care who knows
Oh love me baby, love me like Kennedy and Monroe

Lights are flashing, Main Street paparazzi
You got them lining up to watch you want me
Let's one up the rumors

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain't mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby, kiss me, like you don't care who knows
Oh love me baby, love me like Kennedy and Monroe

Don't tell me the world couldn't handle
A good old-fashioned American scandal

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain't mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby kiss me, like you don't care who knows

Hold me baby, hold me like you ain't mine to hold
Oh kiss me baby, kiss me, like you don't care who knows
Oh love me baby, love me like Kennedy and Monroe

(Don't tell me the world couldn't handle) Kennedy and Monroe
(A good old-fashioned American scandal) ooh, like Kennedy and Monroe
(Don't tell me the world couldn't handle) Kennedy and Monroe
(A good old-fashioned American scandal)
Don't tell me the world couldn't handle
A good old-fashioned American scandal

// Southern Babylon //

Starin' through a spiderweb where the windshield used to be
What's left of the dashboard, the smell of gasoline
I can just make out one neon light south off through the trees
My feet took over walkin' 'fore my mind caught up with me
When I walked in my tab was already open
My drink was poured and my cigarette was smokin'

Somebody said "Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?
Got a band up there been dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'
Rest that trav'lin' soul, looks like the road was long
Welcome to Southern Babylon"

Had to pull myself together and ask to use the phone
The waitress smiled a wicked grin, it sent a chill right through my bone
I said "I need to call the tow-truck, some way to move along"
She said, "Who you wanna call now that you've been called home?"

She said "Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?
You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Hotel California'
And maybe it's not sinkin' in, but you'll learn to play along
Honey, you been gone since you walked into Southern Babylon"

"I'm not supposed to be here, bartender don't you see?
I took a gig down in Atlanta and the brakes gave out on me"
She said, "We know all about ya. It's a little bit too late"
She handed me a guitar and pointed to the flames

"Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?
You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'
Rest that trav'lin' soul, looks like the road was long
Welcome to Southern Babylon"
Southern Babylon
Welcome to Southern Babylon
Welcome home

// The Jacket //

It's got a hole in the elbow, bandana pocket
Silver button missin' from the snap at the bottom
I said, "That thing's seen better days, Daddy, you should toss it"
And he just said "Darlin I can't"

This thing is two-thousand bonfires, I hitchhiked to Boulder
It's kept a million raindrops off your mama's shoulders
My heart on my sleeve, my life in these patches
Then he wrapped his arms around me in that old
Jean jacket

It's been a bed for a hound-dog, a picnic blanket
There's blood on the collar from a punk who tried to take it from me
Seen Willie Nelson play four or five states
The best Levi ever made

We strung for miles of barbed wire in Corinth, Mississippi
A night in county jail with an old drunk and a hippy
It's my heart on the sleeve, it's my life in these patches
With his arms wrapped around me in that old
Jean jacket

It ain't much to look at, but he let me have it
So I could feel his arms around me in that old
Jean jacket
Jean jacket

// Livin' Next To Leroy //

I used to roll my cigarettes on the hood of my Tacoma
Sit and watch the world go by
I was seventeen and green and knowin' nothin' 'bout livin'
In a town where people go to die

Leroy was a transplant from somewhere in Alabama
The first time I met him, he asked me for a spoon
And I thought he must've been in a bluegrass band, or somethin'
But I'd find out one August afternoon

Three doors down, there's tinfoil on the table
They ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house: high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how big a hit the neighbor's bike'll get ya, boy
Livin' next to Leroy

In the classroom, Susie Highschool was packin' pills like notes
Takin' shots in the parkin' lot at lunch
And I'd join in every now and then 'cause you can't beat the cool crowd
I'd go to Leroy's 'til I sobered up

Three doors down, there's tinfoil on the table
They ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house: high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how big a hit that class ring'll get ya, boy
Livin' next to Leroy

I rolled a J on the day I got my diploma
I knew Leroy would be proud
I can't forget shakin' him, tryin' to wake him on that sofa
He never did come 'round

Yeah, three doors down, there's tinfoil on the table
They ain't cookin' up nothin' good 'round here
There's one in every house: high on the couch, stealin' cable
On the dark side of the country it ain't bonfires, it ain't beer
But you find out quick how high you get when that last hit gets you boy

Livin' next to Leroy
Livin' next to Leroy
Next to Leroy

// A Little Dive Bar In Dahlonega //

To the bag packed, first love leaver
The heart cracked, double down dreamer
The homesick for grass that's greener
And a slice of Mama's peach pie

To the flat broke, couch cushion gas money
The worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey
Missin' someone all the while runnin'
Gunnin' for the brighter lights

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

We've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial
And a good friend we ain't seen in a while
And a slow dance left in these boots
And a chance at putting down new roots

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Hear a song from a band that saves ya, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night

Here's to the break ups that didn't break us
The break down, wrong turn that takes ya
To a little dive bar in Dahlonega
Meet a girl outside Atlanta, man
It's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em
Nothing's going right
You're just singing along with your drink raised
A pretty little blonde thing's looking your way
Makin' the best of the worst day kinda night
Yeah, it's making the best of the worst day kind of night

Oh...
Here's to the breakups
It's that kinda night

// Andy (I Can't Live Without You) //

You drink my whiskey without asking
You put your boots up on my couch
Drives me crazy to remind you
More than once to take the garbage out

You use my good towels on the dog
And that's the only thing I've asked you not to do
Most days I'd love to lock you out
I can't live without you

The kitchen table ain't for business
Wish you'd put the bills where they go
I guess you need an invitation
To the backyard to see that it needs mowed

You leave your whiskers in the sink
And I've told you till I'm black and blue
You never worry what our neighbors think
I can't live without you

'Cause you've got my back
Even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows
Me and my heart can't get along
I got some reasons to cry
I can't tell you which one
But you don't ask no questions
You just hold me till I'm done
And when I'm looking to fight you flat refuse
I can't live without you

You're always voicing your opinion
You play your guitar way too loud
God I reckon it would kill you
Lift a finger, help me clean this house
You know your jokes ain't all that funny
But I'll keep on laughing if you want me to
Nobody understands why I love you
I can't live without you

You've got my back
Even when I'm wrong
You're the only one who knows
Me and my heart can't get along
Well I got some reasons to cry
I can't tell you which one
But you don't ask no questions
You just hold me till I'm done
And when I'm looking to fight you flat refuse
I can't live without you
I can't live without you

// El Dorado //

Mornin' side of midnight, 'nother state line comin' up
It's down to the truckers, the troopers, and troubadours like us
I'm out of coffee, Andy's burnin' his last cigarette
And the needle's droppin', but the tank ain't empty yet

We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado

Hotel paper full of songs I write for you
Highway sailor, miles and miles to sing 'em to
That silver linin', oh no it ain't hidin' on no map
I gotta find it, I'll pull it down and bring it back

We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado
We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado
...

// Tired Of Being Happy //

God, it's good to see you, I just got in
We got a lot of catchin' up to do, how the hell you been?
Yeah I saw the pictures, the two of you all dressed up
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, you look so damn good in love

And if you ever get tired of bein' happy
You know I won't be hard to find at all
Baby you know you always had me
And if you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

Now darlin', I ain't sayin' it won't all work out
It's just no one knows like I do, you can't settle for settlin' down
I guess I gotta own it, I'm the one that let you go
I ain't puttin' nothin' on ya, I just wanted you to know

If you ever get tired of bein' happy
Oh, I won't be hard to find at all
I've never wrecked a home, but don't put it past me
If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

If you ever get tired of bein' happy
You know I won't be hard to find at all
I've never wrecked a home, but don't put it past me
If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call
Oh, why don't ya give me a call
Yeah, just give me a call

// Home Sweet Highway //

Dreamin' 'bout you is keepin' me up at night
And these stayin'-put-shoes I'm wearin' don't fit me right
I think I'm losin' myself, it's a slow bleed
I've been missing you, are you missing me?

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

A cup of truckstop coffee and a cigarette
Add it to the list of things I ain't quit yet
Oh I've tried and I've tried leavin' you alone
But I keep on comin' back, 'cause there's no place like home

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
And if I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway
On this home, home sweet highway
