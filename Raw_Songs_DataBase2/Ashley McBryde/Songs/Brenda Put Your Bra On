Brenda, put your bra on, there's trouble next door
Grab a pack of cigarettes and meet me on the porch
Marvin baby mama 'bout to catch him with a whore
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)

I knew she shouldn't let that bitch watch her baby
I used to work with her at the Krystal
She always got them good shifts just 'cause she had good tits
And cut her shirts off at the middle

Brenda, put your bra on, it's just getting good
Shit's goin' down in the trailerhood
Pants 'round his ankles, still sportin' wood
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)

Well, did you hear that? There went the good dishes
I hope they don't knock out the cable
Ole Suntan City won't look quite as pretty
When Tina puts that ass through a table

Brenda, put your bra on, there's trouble next door
Grab a pack of cigarettes and meet me on the porch
Marvin baby mama put that whore on the floor
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Put it on

Put it on, shit

Brenda, put your bra on, here comes Channel 4
We ain't never been on the TV before
Grab the marijuana, stick it down your drawers
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on
