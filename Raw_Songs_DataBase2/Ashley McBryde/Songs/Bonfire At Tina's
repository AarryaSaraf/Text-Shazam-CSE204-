Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone

You don't feel pretty (Light it up)
You've been lonely (Light it up)
He's so damn lazy (Light it up)
My step-kids hate me (Light it up)

And when it's gone to ashes, we'll be laughing, fall down drunk
If we fall down on our asses, hell, we'll pick each other up

Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh

You got cheated on (Light it up)
Don't get paid enough (Light it up)
Don't get laid enough (Light it up)
Got a joint (Light it up)

Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh

When memory comes around, yeah, we'll go back to talking shit
But tonight, we're all just bitches that are sick of taking it (Bonfire at)

Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Oh, small town women ain't built to get along (Oh-oh-oh)
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone (Oh-oh-oh)
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
