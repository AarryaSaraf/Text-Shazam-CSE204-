I remember thinking the Marlboro Man could be the man of my dreams
His dirty boots strung all across my living room
A real life hero should come and rescue me
From a tin roof in a one horse town where I couldn't tell if anything else existed
I was trapped and he got out of every scrap that he got into
And I was over here missing it

You wouldn't believe all the things I told, I told myself
It seemed like the only way to cope, but it never really helped

And all these bars are full of strangers lives
Like they came right out of a song
And I've let a few put their boots beneath my bed
I never let em' stay there long
Just when nights are kinda cold and I don't know that I can handle feeling like that again
So I reach for the comfort of someone so unfamiliar across my skin

You wouldn't believe all the things I did to myself
Just searching for something I couldn't resist, it never really helped

Show me a tall dark stranger and I, I show you a liar
Hand me the world on a string and I, I'll set it on fire

You wouldn't believe all the things I saw behind those curtains
You wouldn't believe all the things I drank to keep it from hurting
You wouldn't believe all the hearts I left broken and scattered
You wouldn't believe the price you'll pay for happy ever after
You wouldn't believe all the things I told myself, I saw myself, I showed myself, mmm...

I just remember thinking the Marlboro Man could be the man of my dreams
