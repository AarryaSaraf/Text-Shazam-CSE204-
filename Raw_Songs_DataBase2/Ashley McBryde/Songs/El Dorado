Mornin' side of midnight, 'nother state line comin' up
It's down to the truckers, the troopers, and troubadours like us
I'm out of coffee, Andy's burnin' his last cigarette
And the needle's droppin', but the tank ain't empty yet

We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado

Hotel paper full of songs I write for you
Highway sailor, miles and miles to sing 'em to
That silver linin', oh no it ain't hidin' on no map
I gotta find it, I'll pull it down and bring it back

We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado
We can't stop now, can't stop now
No we can't stop now, El Dorado
...
