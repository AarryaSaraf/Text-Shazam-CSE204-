If you really wanna know, she comes here a lot
She just loves to hear the music and dance
K13 is her favorite song
If you play it, you might have a chance

Tonight, she's only sippin' white wine
She's friendly and fun lovin' most of the time

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' 'bout him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

Here's a glass of Chablis, some quarters and change
Maybe you can turn her love life around
Then she won't need the salt or the lime anymore
To shoot that old memory down

Just remember her heart's on the mend
So if you ever come back and see her again

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' 'bout him and then she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night

Don't ask her on a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
On a straight tequila night
She'll start thinkin' about him and she's ready to fight
Blames her broken heart on every man in sight
On a straight tequila night
