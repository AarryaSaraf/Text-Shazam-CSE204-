I heard go on, and go
But just know where you're goin' is a dead end
Playin' in bars only makes you
The star of a house band
And sometimes the hardest part
Was just to keep playin'
I'd been gone long ago if I'd listened
To what they were sayin', what they were sayin'

But I didn't, I don't, I never will
No, they just started a fire they can't control
And I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
Knowin' I didn't, I don't, I never will

They said "Seein' your name up in lights
You know it's gonna change ya
You'll look in the mirror some night
And you'll see a stranger"
But you gotta play the game
If you ever wanna play to the big crowds
You've gone as far as you'll ever go
Unless you're willin' to sell out, girl, sell out

Well, I didn't, I don't, I never will
No, they just started a fire they can't control
And I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
Knowin' I didn't, I don't, I never will
Oh, I never will

Money and fame it'll go to your head if you get it
They never did understand all the reasons we did it
I can point out the names and the faces of the people who said it
Oh, but honestly, I just don't want 'em to get any credit

Oh, I didn't, no, I never will, I never will
Oh, they just started a fire they can't control, oh no, no
And you know I wouldn't trade one moment for the way it feels
The way it feels
I didn't, I don't, I never will
I never will
