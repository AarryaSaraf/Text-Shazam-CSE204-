Strong and wild like a Carolina summer wind
You come going in and out of my life again
And I drop what I'm doing every time you come around
Only hear you knocking bout the time I decide to stick around
Its not healthy my friends tell me all the time
I gotta lose your number and find someone and make em mine
I hate to say it but its hard to disagree
Cause you'll only hold me long enough to leave a mark on me
Won't you leave me baby let me watch you walk away
Cause believe me baby it may be what its gonna to take
I'm not the first and I've got a feeling I ain't the last
So I need you to break my heart, aw baby break it fast
Oh...

Lost and lonely you leave me somewhere in the night
And if you ever loved me then Love me enough to twist the knife
I miss every broken minute and the heartache of it is
I'll still walk right off the edge to taste the poison on your lips
Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Cause believe me baby, it may be what its gonna to take
I'm not the first and I've got a feeling I ain't the last
So I need you to break my heart, aw baby break it fast
Oh...

Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Won't you leave me baby, just let me watch you
Won't you leave me baby, and let me watch you walk away
Oh...
Let me watch you
Let me watch you
Let me watch you, walk away
Oh...

Why won't you
Why won't you, walk
