A little outside of Elizabethtown
There's a little bar where I'd sit down
And trade a couple country songs for Kentucky Bourbon
A little ol' gal in the middle of the night
Learning how to love and learning how to fight
And learning how to like my brand of hurting

Hell there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

I love somebody everybody loves
And he's in love with my messed up
Most folks can't see my soul through the smoke
And we're suitcase marks on a hard wood floor
Flipping the bird and slamming the door
And peeling out and turning round and coming home

But hell there's hell everywhere I go
So I'm sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
There's higher roads than I rode
And better choices than I chose
I'm just sticking with the devil I know

Momma says get my ass to church
Daddy says get my ass to work
Doctor says I gotta give up on these smokes
Everybody's got something to say
About how I gotta change my ways
But I got something to say of my own
Hell, there's hell everywhere I go
So I'm sticking with the devil I know
