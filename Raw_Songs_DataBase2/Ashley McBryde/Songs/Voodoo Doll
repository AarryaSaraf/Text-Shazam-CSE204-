You know how this town talks
But I didn't hear a thing
I just had a feeling, rattle in my bones
I saw what I saw now I can't unsee it

Scratches on my wall
Her face in my mirror
Whispers down the hall
Smoke on the ceiling

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin' it
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

It's one hell of a curse
I know she ain't sleepin' 'cause I ain't sleepin'
Damn, those kisses hurt
They ain't gonna stop
So I've been keeping salt around my door
Red candle burning
Better light one more, it ain't workin'

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin' it
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

I keep smelling cigarettes
Feel that pretty black dress slipping off her back
I don't drink rum but I'm tasting it
Rolling off her tongue, every drop, you ain't wastin'
Those lips on her neck, needle in my chest
Ooh, she's makin' my skin crawl
You got yourself a voodoo doll

You've got yourself a voodoo doll
