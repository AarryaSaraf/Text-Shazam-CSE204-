We were alone
In a crowd of a thousand
Standing under a giant Ferris wheel
You covered my shoulders
Breeze off the ocean
December on the Santa Monica Pier
You were there

We were at home
Dinner was over
The one I love was anxious for a kiss
I know I shouldn't
Most times I wouldn't
But I offered my cheek
A swing and a miss
You were there

Why can't you just turn me loose
Whatever's inside of you
And find some other tortured port of call
Cause I can count em one by one
Moments I've been absent from
Cause I can't get me rid of you at all

Dark quiet hours
Moon through a window
A hand on my shoulder
Face the wall
I gotta shake it
I know he's aching
And I'm just praying soon sleep will fall

Red wine and roses
Dancing and laughing
It's good to see us smiling once again
I got it handled
Once and for always
Preacher asked me if I do
And then you were there

Why can't you just turn me loose
Whatever's inside of you
And find some other tortured port of call
Favorite little tragedy
Ever present history
No, I can't get me rid of you at all
No, I can't get me rid of you at all
