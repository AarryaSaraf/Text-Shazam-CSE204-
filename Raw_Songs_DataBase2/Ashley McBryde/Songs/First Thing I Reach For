Brown liquor in black coffee puts my headache off for now
The hurt last night put on me still spinning me around
And I light up a smoke, even though I can hardly breathe
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

Another night of bad decisions, there's one still laying in my bed
The bastard in me wishes he'd've woke up first and left
And you'd think a girl on fire would stay away from gasoline
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

Oh the last thing I need is to need you like I do
And the first thing I reach for is anything but you
If I can keep away the lonely for a moment, well that's good enough for me
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need

If I can keep away the lonely for a moment, well that's good enough for me
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need
The first thing I reach for is the last thing I need
