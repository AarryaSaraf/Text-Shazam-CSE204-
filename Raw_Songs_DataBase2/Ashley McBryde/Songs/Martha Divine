I've got this feeling
And I got this shovel
Between me and you and it
You're in a little trouble
I saw you sneaking
And I know what happened
I think it's kinda funny you got caught
Only, I ain't laughing

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel, you're bound for Hell
But evidently, the devil was busy so I moved you up in line, Martha Divine

Well, you call him 'Darling'
And I call him 'Daddy'
And Daddy says he'll whup me if I don't keep momma happy
Honor thy father
Honor thy mother
But The Bible doesn't say a damn thing about your daddy's lover

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel, you're bound for Hell
But evidently, the devil was busy 
So I moved you up in line, Martha Divine

Momma's an angel
My daddy isn't
Looks like a little more of him rubbed off on me than didn't
Well, I'll leave you to it
They'll never prove it
And if they ever find out, I'll say, "The devil made me do it"

Martha Divine, Martha Divine
You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Martha Divine, your ass is mine
And it ain't murder if I bury you alive
Martha Divine
