In 1941, a physicist named Ray McEntire
Rediscovered a method first discovered by Carl Munters
An inventor from Sweden, you knew that, right?
Yeah, I looked it up
Anyway, ol' Ray found a way to make large quantities
Of extrudent polystyrene in a closed-cell foam form
That was resistant to moisture

But you and I know it as styrofoam
Which reminds me, tonight, on my way home
I need to hit the Kwik Sak
And for five bucks, I got myself a portable box
I can fill with ice and keep all my Natty Lights
Nice and cold
You gotta love styrofoam

You can cram it down in your flower pots
Get it in peanut form and fill up a box
So that the crappy ash tray that your kid made in class
To send to Grandpappy don't get cracked along the way
Hey, it's also used to make rafts for the US Military
I'm for anything that supports the US Military
Thousands of usages, all kinds of stuff
And that includes forty-four ounce cups

Styrofoam
I fill it half way up with Diet Coke
And top it off with brown liquor
Now, I'll walk down Main Street and catch me a buzz
Right up underneath the nose of the fuzz 'cause of
Styrofoam
You gotta love styrofoam
I know I do

Some folks say, "Hey, what about Mother Nature?
It decomposes so slow"
I'm no scientist, all I know is this
Beer I'm drinkin' is so cold
Thanks to

Styrofoam
Styrofoam
Styrofoam

So thank you, Ray McEntire
Thank you, Carl Munters
And thanks, Steve (Steve)
The guy at the Kwik Sak
Styrofoam
