Dreamin' 'bout you is keepin' me up at night
And these stayin'-put-shoes I'm wearin' don't fit me right
I think I'm losin' myself, it's a slow bleed
I've been missing you, are you missing me?

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

A cup of truckstop coffee and a cigarette
Add it to the list of things I ain't quit yet
Oh I've tried and I've tried leavin' you alone
But I keep on comin' back, 'cause there's no place like home

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
And if I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

Home sweet highway, oh won't you roll
And I'll ride with you like a rollin' stone
If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway

If I have it my way, Lord, when I go
I'll go on this home sweet highway
On this home, home sweet highway
