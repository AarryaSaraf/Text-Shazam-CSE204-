Telephones and post cards
I called you from the lobby bar on Tuesday
How's the Okra coming up?
And boy, I wish I had me some
Save me a plate
Yeah, I've been sleeping alright
I get a couple days in July
Kiss Dad for me, I love you both, goodnight

Sparrow, oh it wouldn't trade nothing for the way it feels to fly
It ain't fair though, how you miss the ground when you're out here in the sky
Higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

Hard rain over Fayetteville
Jack and Coke, a sleeping pill
Living the dream
30, 000 feet down there, you're
Waking daddy up in his chair
And cutting the lights and locking the door
And saying a prayer

For a sparrow, wouldn't trade nothing for the way it feels to fly
It ain't fair though, how you miss the ground when you're out here in the sky
You're higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

And higher than you've ever been
Lonely like you never been
Waiting on the wind to take you home

Sparrow
Sparrow
Sparrow
Sparrow
Sparrow
