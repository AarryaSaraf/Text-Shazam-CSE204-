She didn't see the flash
Her makeup wasn't perfect
Purse slung on her chair
Cigarette hand in her hair
A thousand-mile stare
Just sittin' there

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair

Naw, she didn't dance
But not 'cause nobody asked her
She just sat and laughed
Like the bubbles in her glass
Disappearing like her happy ever after

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair

Shouldn't be a prize
For catching the last smile of a girl named Caroline

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair
At the Faulkner County fair
