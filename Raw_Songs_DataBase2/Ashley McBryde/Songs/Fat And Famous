Frizzy hair and glasses
At the back of the class
You made fun of me on Friday nights
I was down there in the band
You were up there in the stands
And now who's voted 'Most Likely to Hate Their Life'

You got fat, I got famous
Ain't that funny how it changes
You made fun of me for years
I get paid to play my songs
I got a headline gig in Austin
You got a closet drinking problem
And a juvenile delinquent
Souvenir from Senior Prom
I got a Budweiser endorsement
You're re-financing your mortgage
How's it feel to make those payments?
You got fat and I got famous

You cheated off my papers
And ignored me in the hall
Drove a daddy's money Mustang around town
I drove a rusty pile of tin
That you loved to go by me in
It looks a lot like that heap you're driving now

You got fat, I got famous
Ain't that funny how it changes
You made fun of me for years
I get paid to play my songs
I got a headline gig in Austin
You got a prayer-chain gossip column
And a pack of crappy friends
And an ass just like your mom
My guitar player says I'm sexy
I strum his Tele, when he lets me
It's a bitch the way life changes
You got fat and I got famous

You know it's nice to sing about the truth every now and then
Truth is; karma and gravity
Yeah well, they're the same thing

I got a Budweiser endorsement
You're re-financing your mortgage
Ain't that a bitch?
The way life changes
'Cause you got fat and I got famous
