It's gospel night at the strip club
Been sleepin' in my car
I lead the singin' service with a half-ass tuned guitar
Brandy's singin' backup while Lonnie's tendin' bar
Just waitin' for more sinners to show up

Crystal just started dancin'
She's always right on point
She don't mind if you don't tip her
As long as you slip her a joint
Patti's got an upper
To get her through her shift
And a downer so she can lay down with the kids

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Would you recognize him if he bought you a beer

Lonnie he's a listener
He shoulda been a priest
It's the same confession on a barstool or your knees
He makes a mean Manhattan but he ain't drank since '93
Does the last call benediction then wipes the bar slate clean

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Would you recognize him if he bought you a beer

The same old dirty dollars, keep gettin' passed around
To whoever needs 'em most and I guess that's me right now
Cause I'm starin' at this Jackson someone laid here at my feet
That's gas in my ol Honda and somethin' warm to eat

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
He laid down a twenty and then he disappeared
