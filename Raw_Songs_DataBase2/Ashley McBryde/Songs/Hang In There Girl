About fifteen, grey sweatpants
On the edge of the road, puttin' up a flag
On a beat-up mailbox
Barely hanging on

Half a mile on the other side
Of the low water bridge and the poverty line
Two old mutts and a single wide
That's home

I know, all too well, that look in her eyes
Yeah, I've been right there
At the end of that drive

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Tangled up in the small town weeds
Dreamin' of the day you leave
And all the places you wanna be
I know

A set of wheels, a set of keys
You can almost feel that summer breeze
Check the oil and the anti-freeze
And go

When that moment comes, buckle up and hold on tight
Yeah, I've been right there
At the end of that drive

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Trust me when I say you're doin' fine
You know, growin' up takes a little time

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
Hang in there girl
You gonna be alright

Alright
