There ain't enough water in the river to wash me clean
After all the dirty deeds I've done and seen
Sins like mine don't come out easy
Ain't enough water in the river for the lord to forgive me

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama

Knew the good book real good
Knew the bad all too well
Spend his life rattlin' cages
And runnin' that devil's ass back to Hell

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was

He was all fire and brimstone
Firewater on his breath
Spittin' 90 proof of truth to a tent full of sinners
'Til there wasn't one single unsaved soul left, son

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was

Told my boy all 'bout his pap-paw
And how he learned how to chase the devil away
Some day I lay a rattlesnake down
And he's gonna pick it up, shake it at the sinners and say

My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
My daddy was a man of God
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
In South Alabama
My daddy was the Devil's undertaker
My daddy is a saver of souls
My daddy was a rattlesnake preacher
Just like his daddy before him was
Like his daddy before him

I sing, yes
Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
My daddy told me so
