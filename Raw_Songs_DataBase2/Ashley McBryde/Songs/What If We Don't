This is the part we call it a night
You get into your car, I get into mine
You're thinkin' 'bout me, and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
We can go home alone like we always do

But what if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

There's always the fear of goin' there now
Things gettin' weird if it don't work out
'Cause this kinda thing can't stop once it starts
We might end up breakin' each others hearts

But what if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

I don't wanna over think it
I wanna kiss you right now
Baby I'm done thinkin' about

What if we don't? What if we don't?
What if we stop fightin' what we know we both want
We might regret how far we let it go
But what if we don't?

What if we don't?
What if we don't?
What if we don't?
