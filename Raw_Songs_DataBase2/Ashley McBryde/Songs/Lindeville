The dogs are howlin' at the moon tonight
The breeze is blowin' through the trees just right
And I'm way up here with the whippoorwills
And there's nothing but stars over Lindeville
Nothing but starts over Lindeville

Betty had just one glass of wine
She's alright, but just feeling fine
And Patti fell asleep without her pills
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville

Leroy and Patience layin' down for rest
Her little brown face layin' on his chest
He misses Caroline, he always will
Cause there's one more star over Lindeville
There's one more star over Lindeville

And I've seen parades
And I've seen fire
Watching over this ole town
Like a bird on a wire

I've been keeping time on the courthouse square
Since their Daddy's Daddy's put me here
And tonight I wish I could just stand still
Cause look at those stars over Lindeville
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville
