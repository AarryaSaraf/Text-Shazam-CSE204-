Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on

Cause he lived

When you have a mountain you can't climb
When you have a problem in your way

Just remember his joy divine
And from his path you will not stray

(Living cause he lived)
What he wants me to be
(Living cause he lived)
He gave so I can be free
(Living cause he lived)
To live righteously

Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on
Cause he lived

Treat your neighbor right
Be faithful honest and true
Don't let darkness overcome the light
Cause he led the way for you

(Living cause he lived)
What he wants me to be
(Living cause he lived)
He gave so I can be free
(Living cause he lived)
To live righteously

Live on live on live on
Live on live on live on
Cause he lived

(Living cause he lived)
(Living cause he lived)
(Living cause he lived)
