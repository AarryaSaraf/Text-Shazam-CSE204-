Time don't make it better
I just keep on falling for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waiting for you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope living without you
Please don't change your smile, you're the only one
I love please never die
'Fact, you're gunna be the only for me
I've been sitting down waiting so desperately
Time don't make it better
I just keep on falling for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waiting for you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope breathing without you
I got no fear in me, but it feels stupid trying to make you see
'Cause you got me feeling high like a kite you see
If it don't make sense it ain't meant to be
But tears don't make it better
I just can't keep falling on you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep falling on you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to find the key
If I wait any longer my heart will bleed
And spend my whole life in a lucid dream
When my friends tell me that I got a love disease
'Cause I said won't live if I have to do life without you
(All I think about is you...)
