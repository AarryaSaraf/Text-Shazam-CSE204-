Fly, don't worry
Just fly, don't worry
Fly, don't worry
Just fly, don't worry

You came the hard way
To get your heartbreak
Don't be too sorry
Leave here and fly away

Fly, don't worry (Do you love? Do love love?)
(Do you love? Do love love?)
Just fly, don't worry (Do you love? Do love love?)
(Do you love? Do love love?)
(Do you love? Do love love?)
Don't worry (Do you love? Do love love?)
Just fly, don't worry (Do you love? Do love love?)
(Do you love? Do love love?)
