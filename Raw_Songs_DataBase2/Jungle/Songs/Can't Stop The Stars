I know that you want me
So say that you do
With every word of yours
Like a play back and forth

I won't let it haunt me
No way that it's true
You know I've been working hard
Every day I come home

She said

Can't stop the stars from moving
'Cause you ain't got the time
I think your chance is coming
But it's gotta be tonight

Girl, if I ever find out
Oh what my heart's been missing
Won't you give me something

I know that you want me
So say that you do
You know I've been working hard
Every day back and forth

She said

Can't stop the stars from moving
'Cause you ain't got the time
I think your chance is coming
But it's gotta be tonight

I wanna be young and free
All I wanna be is dancing free
I wanna be young and free
All I wanna be is dancing free
