God if I give up
Thinking 'bout the future
Thought you'd had enough
Thinking 'bout the past

'Cause I don't wanna wake up any morning without you
Talk of all our dreams
All the things we'll do
You said oh

Lift your body up
Naturally we fall
Give your body love
I won't let you go
It's all coming on
This time I know
Guess it's true
We'll ride along
Taking my time
You'll find the one
Lifting you
Up on and on

What I gotta do
To help you realise it
If you thought it through
Don't wanna analyse it

'Cause I don't wanna wake up any morning without you
Talk of all our dreams
All the things we'll do
You said oh

Lift your body up
Naturally we fall
Give your body love
I won't let you go
It's all coming on
This time I know
Guess it's true
We'll ride along
Taking my time
You'll find the one
Lifting you
It's all coming on

Tear my world apart
(We love until it's gone)
Tear my world apart
(You know I will be strong)
Tear my world apart
(We gotta carry on)
Tear my world apart
