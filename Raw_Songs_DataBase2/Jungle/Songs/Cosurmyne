Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
How d'you do, baby?

Follow the memory
Reading my hand
I wanna feel you
To know I'm alive
'Cos I want a family, uh-uh-uh-uh

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't disappear

Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again
Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again

On my own
Hot spell on the roof I'm on
On my own
Tryna give in to find someone
Cosurmyne

Long as you're near me
Leading me there
A kiss on the surface
Then I got high
Decide what you're feeling
Tell me I'm dreaming

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear

Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again
Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again

On my own
Hot spell on the roof I'm on
On my own
Tryna give in to find someone

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear
'Cos time has a way with us that makes me think it could all go wrong
Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear
