Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving

Bad avenue
If you're coming like that, then it's really 'bout time you know
In a new house, in a new place
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving

I can hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Ah, you're breaking my heart
Thanks for making me stronger
(Keep moving)

So you think you'll find the truth?
If you change
When you're livin' like that, you can spin around town you know
In a new house, in the UK
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving

I can hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Ah, you're breaking my heart
Thanks for making me stronger

I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all

Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
I could live with it, I could live with it all

Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
