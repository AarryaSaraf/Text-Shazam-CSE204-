I guess I'll miss the last train, baby
It's just what I gotta do
Ain't nowhere I wanna be
More than when I'm here with you

Got a lot, got a lot to learn
No my love, no my love, no way

I booked it on a Tuesday, baby
Trying to get to somewhere new
I don't think I've found you lady
It's crazy I'm here with you

Got a lot, got a lot to learn
No my love, no my love, no way

If you want me now
Love me every moment
If you want me now
Don't you let me walk on

If you want me now
Love me every moment
If you want me now
Don't you let me walk on

Breathe!

Love me every moment
Don't you let me walk on
