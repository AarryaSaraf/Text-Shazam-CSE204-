(One day, she'll take the world from you)

Running baby, down the beach, yeah
They all tell me, I don't need ya now
Running baby, hold on
I'll be here for you

Just hold me, I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Just hold me, and we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California

Miss the sunlight, I was saying
Your love is amazing, so hold on to it for me
Come on baby, hold on
I'll be here for you

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California

Just hold me, I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Held up at the border
Just hold me, and we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California
Oh Lord
California

California
