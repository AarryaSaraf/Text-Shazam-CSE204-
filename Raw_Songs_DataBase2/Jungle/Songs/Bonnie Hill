In the sunshine
It's okay to be selfless
Let your soul shine
It's okay to feel helpless
With someone like me
Now you can breathe
With someone like me
You won't fall

(Oh, I don't)
When you gonna come around? (Know why)
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you (You go)
Said I wanna call you now (Won't cry)
'Cause I don't really care for issues (At my door)
When you gonna come around? (No lie)
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you (You go)
Said I wanna call you now (This time)
'Cause I don't really care for issues

In the sunshine
It's okay to be selfless
Let your soul shine
It's okay to feel helpless
With someone like me
Now you can breathe
With someone like me
You won't fall

With someone like me
To tell to breathe
With someone like me
Oh no

With someone like me

(Oh, I don't)
When you gonna come around? (Know why)
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you (You go)
Said I wanna call you now (Won't cry)
'Cause I don't really care for issues (At my door)
When you gonna come around? (No lie)
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you (You go)
Said I wanna call you now (This time)
'Cause I don't really care for issues

In the sunshine
It's okay to be selfless
Let your soul shine
It's okay to feel helpless
With someone like me

Someone like
