// Dry Your Tears //

Dry your tears
Don't cry
I'll be here
This time
All your fears
Won't fly
I'll be here
This time

// Keep Moving //

Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
Keep moving, keep moving

Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving

Bad avenue
If you're coming like that, then it's really 'bout time you know
In a new house, in a new place
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving

I can hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Ah, you're breaking my heart
Thanks for making me stronger
(Keep moving)

So you think you'll find the truth?
If you change
When you're livin' like that, you can spin around town you know
In a new house, in the UK
If you change
Keep moving, keep moving

I can hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Ah, you're breaking my heart
Thanks for making me stronger

I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all
I can live with it, I can live with it all

Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
I could live with it, I could live with it all

Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving

// All Of The Time //

All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time

You never know
When I'm feeling low
Never talk
You're laying low
Better off
I'm beaming up

(It's all alright up there)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(If you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
It's all alright. It's all alright

Why don't we talk in the morning
Want you to need me my love
Could it be easy for us?

(It's all alright up there)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(If you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
It's all alright. It's all alright

All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time

All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time

// Romeo //

Never lose, steady climb
City crime infested
Ten years so divine my blessings
I injected hope into my lungs
And spoke up things I once
Thought were silly dreams
I'll walk you through the scene
Jump on a jet and it's chartered a star
I'm batting the cycle
I don't even like her
She deaded I cannot be bothered to call
Hope you see the light, darling
Oh yes, running like four legs
Them people fall
They don't want no run-ins like bow legs no
Jumped out the circus like Soleil curving
My people got me, copy, solid, sterling

Steel resolve
Look at you
You like a cube of sugar in a pool of water
Bet you will dissolve
Had so much to prove

But no wherewithal so you got
Nowhere at all no way out
Either way it's all gon' play out
It's all gon' play out

I never seen this type of glow
Look at the seed I planted grow
I think they need to add a fee
We don't wanna be the status quo
Plot twist, the pot twist
Let's talk about some progress and objectives
If you talking bout less then I'm
Came a long way, I'm a project
Baby, this a Rollie not a Timex
She climb me like an ibex and top me
I came a long way

2010 they tried to end me, glad to see the bullets off
(We still here, you missed, you bitch)
2020 Grammy nominated bet we going off
Admittedly, I know that don't make me but it make the rest of you fonder
Keep 'em all arms length like a boy bassy E Honda
Or Dhalsim, I'm flossin', I'm drippin', two commas
Trying to find the real nothing in my viewfinder
Here you find 'em

Steel resolve
Look at you
You like a cube of sugar in a pool of water
Bet you will dissolve
Had so much to prove

But no wherewithal so you got
Nowhere at all no way out
Either way it's all gon' play out
It's all gon' play out

But no wherewithal so you got
Nowhere at all no way out
Either way it's all gon' play out
It's all gon' play out

// Lifting You //

God if I give up
Thinking 'bout the future
Thought you'd had enough
Thinking 'bout the past

'Cause I don't wanna wake up any morning without you
Talk of all our dreams
All the things we'll do
You said oh

Lift your body up
Naturally we fall
Give your body love
I won't let you go
It's all coming on
This time I know
Guess it's true
We'll ride along
Taking my time
You'll find the one
Lifting you
Up on and on

What I gotta do
To help you realise it
If you thought it through
Don't wanna analyse it

'Cause I don't wanna wake up any morning without you
Talk of all our dreams
All the things we'll do
You said oh

Lift your body up
Naturally we fall
Give your body love
I won't let you go
It's all coming on
This time I know
Guess it's true
We'll ride along
Taking my time
You'll find the one
Lifting you
It's all coming on

Tear my world apart
(We love until it's gone)
Tear my world apart
(You know I will be strong)
Tear my world apart
(We gotta carry on)
Tear my world apart

// Talk About It //

Feeling
Every day
You ain't got no reason
To walk away
I'm healing
Operate
Help me find the meaning
On the way

What I gotta do?
To start up with you
What I gotta do?
To start something new
What I gotta do?
To start living in the sunshine every day

Let's talk about it
Don't run
Please just talk about it
How you changed my life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

(Let's talk about it)
(Don't run)

True love
Won't pretend
We don't need no slowdance in the sand
Promise you I'll feel good once again
And I'll be there with you
When it ends

What I gotta do?
To start up with you
What I gotta do?
To start something new
What I gotta do?
To start living in the sunshine every day

Let's talk about it
Don't run
We just talk about it
How you changed my life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

The highs and lows
I will always be there
The higher you go
I will always be there
The highs and lows
I will always be there
The higher you go
I will always be there
I will always be there
I will always be there

Let's talk about it
Don't run
We just talk about it
How you changed your life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

// Truth //

Tell you for the first time
When you say you wanted proof
Now you wanna be mine
You're looking for that instant truth

So clear the way
It's early wanna get up
Ah, I wanna get it done
With clarity
I know you'll never get it
But I was just having fun

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

I was gonna keep trying
Call you when I knew I could
Always wanna rewind
And play it like I knew you would

Anyway
Could tell you wanna get up
Ah, you wanna get up close
Let it fade away
If you wanna get better
Then you gotta let it go

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

I come back to find you
Tell you everything I know
You spend all your time at the beach
But you're telling me you're on your own
I won't start it over again
I won't start it over again

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

Anyway
Could tell you wanna get up
Ah, you wanna get up close
Let it fade away
If you wanna get better
Then you gotta let it go

To get your heartbreak

// Goodbye My Love //

I got a thing
I got a feeling
I gotta say there's a sun that will shine
I gotta burn
I got up early
Only to tell you my love

Did you think it could be your time?
Did you think we could make it right?
If I can't pretend you're mine
I'll be down

God is my girl
She is my teacher
Morning will rise to us all in this town
I gotta learn all for the spirit
Only if you are my love

Did you think it could be your time?
Did you think we could make it right?
If I can't pretend you're mine
I'll be down

// Can't Stop The Stars //

I know that you want me
So say that you do
With every word of yours
Like a play back and forth

I won't let it haunt me
No way that it's true
You know I've been working hard
Every day I come home

She said

Can't stop the stars from moving
'Cause you ain't got the time
I think your chance is coming
But it's gotta be tonight

Girl, if I ever find out
Oh what my heart's been missing
Won't you give me something

I know that you want me
So say that you do
You know I've been working hard
Every day back and forth

She said

Can't stop the stars from moving
'Cause you ain't got the time
I think your chance is coming
But it's gotta be tonight

I wanna be young and free
All I wanna be is dancing free
I wanna be young and free
All I wanna be is dancing free
