Listen
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, girl
You told me you love me
You told me you care
Three months after I saw you there
I whispered my name, so softly
You should remember the first time we met

I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

The second time I saw you there
I could not believe the scene, yeah
I've never been happy
I've always been blue
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, yeah now
I've never been happy
I've always been blue, Lord man

I take a look to the sea
And I caught those row boats looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
