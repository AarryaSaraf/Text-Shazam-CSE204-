Make you feel free
Make you feel free

Something hidden inside
That really should come outside
So let's talk about what's hidden inside
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
It will make you feel free

Someone is inside
But really wants to come outside
Just to talk about what's hidden inside
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
It will make you feel free

Something is on your mind
That's keeping you so confined
So let's talk about what's on your mind
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free, yeah
Free at last
Hear the children sing, yeah

Make you feel free, yeah, free
It will make you feel free

Something is on your mind
That's keeping you so confined
So let's talk about what's on your mind
That really should come outside

It will make you feel free
Make you feel free
Free as a bird up in a tree
Free at last, free, free, free, at last, yeah

Sometimes you let me feel like I'm not real
I want to say I'm free at last
When I was out, you didn't take me in

When I was hungry, you gave me no food
Though I was thirsty, you gave me no water
Should feel free from all misery
