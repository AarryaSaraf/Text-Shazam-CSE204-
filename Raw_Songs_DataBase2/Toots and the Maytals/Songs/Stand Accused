I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies

And I wish if every day could be just like today
The morning is warm and bright
There is sunshine everywhere, uh uh
I know Good come out of Evil
And out of Evil come forth Good
Poor people need an helping hand
To help their children get an education

Well I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies

I know Good come out of Evil
And out of Evil come forth Good
Poor people need an helping hand
To help their children get an education

Well I stand accused for doing the right thing
I stand accused for loving the children
I stand accused, yea, since the day that I was born
I stand accused for feeding my enemies
I stand accused, yea
