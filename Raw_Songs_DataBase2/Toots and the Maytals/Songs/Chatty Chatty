I told you a little secret that you should not tell no one
Why did you talk? You talk, you talk
I told you a little secret that you should not tell no one
And you talk, you talk, you talk

Chatty chatty, chatty chatty too much
You talk about people that you don't know
Why you talk? Talk and talk and talk?
You talk about things you don't know how
Why you talk, you talk, you talk, you talk

You showed me the wrong direction
Give me a hard reception
And you talk, you talk, you talk
You showed me the wrong direction
Give me a bad reception
And you talk because you talk
I told you a little secret that you should not tell no one
Why did you talk? You talk, you talk
I told you a little secret that you should not tell no one
And you talk, you talk, you talk
