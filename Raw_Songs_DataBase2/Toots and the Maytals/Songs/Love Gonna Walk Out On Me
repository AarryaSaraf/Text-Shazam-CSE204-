Every time I see your face
Something moves within my heart
And it thrills me to my soul
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe that baby
Love is gonna let me down
I see the morning sun
I know everything is alright
I could see you rushing to my door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe what you're saying to me baby
Love is gonna let me down
I can see the morning sun
And knowing that everything, everything is alright
I can see you rushing through that door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
