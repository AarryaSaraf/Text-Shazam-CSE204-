Night and day and night
I wonder if the time can come
Night and day and night
I wonder if the time can come, money

So I sit alone in life's memory
Just outside of the world I know
So I stand at peace
Watching those wicked creep, yeah

Wonder why they want to stop
Want to stop my life
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Night and day

Night and day and night
I wonder if the time can come
Yeah, you some love my friend
Yeah, you'll get good lovin' my friend

You may want some lovin', my friend, yeah
You'll get good lovin' my friend
