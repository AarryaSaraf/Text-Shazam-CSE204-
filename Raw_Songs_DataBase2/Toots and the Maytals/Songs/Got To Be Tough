Got to be tough when things get rough
You got to be tough and this is a warning
You got to be smart, living in this time
It's not so easy to carry on
So if you are my friend, treat me like a friend
A friend in need and a friend indeed

Just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Things may be hard, so hard
But we have to overcome it, yeah
When you lost someone like loved ones
We have to overcome it, yeah

But just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Got to be tough when things get rough
You got to be tough and this is a warning
You got to be smart, living in this time
It's not so easy to carry on
So if you are my friend, treat me like a friend
A friend in need and a friend indeed

But just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah

Just in case you never know
Or maybe you forget, yeah
Your days are getting shorter, ooh
Our youths are getting slaughtered, yeah
