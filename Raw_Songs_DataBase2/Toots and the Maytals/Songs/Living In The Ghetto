Some of the rich men get their riches from the ghetto
As far as I can see
All the poor ones, that live in the ghetto
They put all their trust in vanity
And that's why, the rich ones shall be richer
And the poor ones shall be poorer

That's how it goes, that's where it's at

You must first see the kingdom of Zion
Then all things will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life

And then you will weep no more
Know that it's God and God and God alone

That set us free from our misery
Really set us free

You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your soul sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you

You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your love sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you

You must first sit in the kingdom of Zion
Then all things, will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life

And then you will know yourself
And know that it's love and purity, that set us free
That set us free from all this misery

Hey! I'm from the ghetto
People living in the ghetto
Let me sing it to you
Can you hear what I say?

That's how it goes
As far as I can see
