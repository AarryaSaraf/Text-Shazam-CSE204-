Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

Now the day is gone and I sit alone, thinking of you, girl
What can I do without you in my life?
I guess that our guessing game just had to end that way
The hardest one to lose of all the games we played

Now the time has passed of living in a dream world
Lying to myself, can't make that scene
Of wondering if you love me or just making a fool of me
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to my island

And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)

And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)

Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

Of all the fun we had, it's still raining in my heart
I know down in my soul I'm surely gonna miss you
But it had to end that way of all the games we played
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island

And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)

And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)

Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
I got to go back, I got to go back, I got to go back, see the sunset die
