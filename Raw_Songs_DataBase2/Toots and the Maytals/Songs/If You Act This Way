If you act this way
You'll never be free
You don't know good
And you don't know good
Don't know good from bad

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
'Cause you can't see, see
See what you have done to me
You must remember you're the one
Who told me that you were true
So it's no use, stop you're crying
There is nothing more I can do, do, do

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
And you can't see, see
See what you have done to me

You must remember you're the one
Who told me that you were true
So it's no use, stop you're crying
There is nothing more I can do, do, do

You'll never know
How wrong you would be
And you can't see, see
See what you have done to me

If you act this way, way, way
You'll never be free
