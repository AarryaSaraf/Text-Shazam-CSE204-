Everybody just
Cryin out (cry out)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Calm down (calm down)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Everybody just
Cryin out (cry out)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Is it an opulin, Iceland, calm down
Have your pomps and pride
For today, today, today is a happy day
For tonight tonight, can be another night
Do re mi fah so la te do
Everybody's just crying crying
Sighing sighing
Dying to see the light
And when they see it, they see it's not bright
Can this be right?
Everybody just
Calm down (calm down)
Calm down (calm down)
Have your pomps and pride
Is it an opulin, Iceland, calm down 
Calm down
Have your pomps and pride
