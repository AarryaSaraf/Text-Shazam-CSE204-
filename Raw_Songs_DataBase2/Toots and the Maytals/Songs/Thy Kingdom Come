Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive them that Joshua said

Oh, my God is wonderful
Oh, my Lord is wonderful
Oh, He is wonderful
Precious to me

Thy kingdom come, oh yeah, Thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven
Oh, yeah, give us this day, oh yeah, our daily bread
And forgive them, yeah, that Joshua said

Thy kingdom come, oh yeah, Thy will be done, oh yeah
On earth as it is in Heaven, oh, oh
Oh, give us this day, oh yeah, our daily bread
And forgive them, oh yeah, that Joshua said
