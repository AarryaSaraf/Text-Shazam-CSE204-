Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah

They say you don't love me
But I know, yeah
I know you really love me
Listen

But you don't love me like I love you
You don't need me
Like I need you so bad
I need you so bad

The way you treat me, you control me
The way you love me
Lord, you make me cry
You make me cry

I've tried my best to keep you
All the way through
But if you're still feeling blue, baby
Come to me, I'll come to you

Aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye

You say you really love me, yeah baby
People say
They say you don't want me, yeah, yeah
Bring it on, on and on

I've tried my very best
To keep you satisfied, yeah
But baby, if you still want more from me
Call on me, I'll give you more, I'll try

I said
Do you really love me, I love you too
But deep down inside of me, yeah, yeah
You know I really want you

Aye, aye, aye, aye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Um hum

Good girl you're feeling me down
Is that how you?
With the rhythm of your heart, look down on me
Yeah, I've got your love

Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey, hey
