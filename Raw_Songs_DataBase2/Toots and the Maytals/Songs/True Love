Love is a habit
My true true love I found
A love that is bright as the moonlight
A love that so wide as the sun

Sometimes it makes me happy
Sometimes it makes me sorry
Sometimes I wanna get rid of it
The next time, I am rid of it

A love is like a gypsy
The true true true true love I prove
A love that is wide as the ocean
And deep deep deep deep as the sea

True true love
