You're gonna leave me, you're gonna leave me
My sweet sweet Jenny
I told you that I love you and no one else
Now you're going, yes you're going to leave me all alone in pain

You're going to leave me
You're going to leave me, my sweet sweet Jenny

I know someday you will realize
What you did to me is wrong
I know someday you will understand
And want to come back to me
(Don't come back to me no more)
