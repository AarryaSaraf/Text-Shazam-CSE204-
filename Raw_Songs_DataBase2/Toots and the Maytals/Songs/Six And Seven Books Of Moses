The six... and the seven books
They wrote them all

You have Genesis and Exodus
Leviticus and Numbers
Deuteronomy and Joshua
Judges and Ruth

For the six and the seven books
They wrote them all

But the six and the seven books
They wrote them all

Wooooow
You have Genesis and Exodus
Leviticus and Numbers
Deuteronomy and Joshua
Judges and Ruth
