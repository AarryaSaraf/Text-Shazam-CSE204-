Darling if you ever say you're mine
Tender love and peace will be our drive

Hey can't you see
I love you with all my heart
Can you say you love me too?
And living together

Oh oh yeah
Just got to be that way

Hey little girl can't you see
I love you with all my heart
Can you say you love me too?
And living together
