When I look
When I look
When I look
Oh yes indeed
When I look
I could see the earth before me
I could see them wave their hands to me
All I got to do is shake my head and cry
'Cause when I look and see no one's been cheering me
When I start forgetting about the world and my life
Somebody said it's the wrong thing to do
So I stop forgetting about the world and my life
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying "Toots, don't fret no more"
So I stopped, looked, and listened
Oh then I hear the good kind say
Son you can go your way
Yes you just buck up and free again
Yes I'm free again
I'm glad to see you free again
Good lord I'm free again
I'm glad to see you free again
It's so free, it's so nice
I'm glad to see you free again
It's so wonderful and so marvelous just to see me free again
I'm glad to see myself free again
