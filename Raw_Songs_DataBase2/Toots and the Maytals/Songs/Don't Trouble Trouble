Bam, Bam
Ah

I want you to know that I am the man
Who fight for the right, not for the wrong
Going there, I'm growing there
Helping the weak against the strong

Soon you will find out the man
I'm supposed to be

Help this man, don't trouble no man
But if you trouble that man it will bring a bam bam
What a bam bam, bam bam
See that? Bam bam
It will bring a bam bam
Can you see that?

Ah
(It will bring a bam bam)
What a bam bam
(What a bam bam)
Can you see that?
(What a bam bam)

Hear what I say
(What a bam bam)
Yeah, hey
(What a bam bam)
(What a bam bam)

This man, don't trouble no man
He know you go to nourish man
This man, don't trouble no man
This man is friend and is trying to trouble no man

That's if you trouble this man
It going to bring a bam bam
What a bam bam
Get a bam bam
