We were brought here, sold out
Victimized, brutally
Every time I keep remembering
What Grandfather said before he died
We were brought down here in slavery
Count out, knocked out, TKO
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

We need more love in our heart
Remember what the preacher said
He said "too much crazy things has been going on"
I don't know what this world is coming to
Hey, Churches against Churches
Preachers against preachers
Kingdom against Kingdom
I don't know what this world is coming to, hey

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

We were brought here, sold out
Victimized, brutally
Every time I keep remembering
What Grandfather said before he died
We were brought down here in slavery
Count out, knocked out, TKO
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to

Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
Everything you do is just brutal
I don't know what this world is coming to
