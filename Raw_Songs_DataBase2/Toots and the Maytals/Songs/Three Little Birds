Say don't worry, don't worry 'bout a thing
I know every little thing gonna be alright
(Sing it, my nephew)

Wake up this morning, smile with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my door step
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, this is my message to you
(Come in, uncle Toots)

Well I say don't worry 'bout a thing
I know every little thing is gonna be alright
(Yea yea)

Wake up this morning, smile with the rising sun
Three little birds sit beside my door step
Singing sweet songs of melody pure and true
Saying, this is my message to you
(One more time)

Say don't worry about a thing
Every little thing is gonna be alright

Say don't worry 'bout a thing
I know every little thing gonna be alright

Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
I know every little thing is gonna be alright
(Yea yea)

Don't worry, don't worry 'bout a darn gone thing
I know every little thing (now, now, now)
Is gonna be alright, is gonna be alright now

Saying, this is my message to you
(One more time)
This is my message to you
(This is my message to you)
This is my message to you
(This is my message to you)
