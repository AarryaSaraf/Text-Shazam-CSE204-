Is this real love I feel tonight
When you kiss me and hold me tight
How can I tell
I've got to be sure
If this is love we could enjoy
So come on
Let's sing in this party
Oh lordy miss Dotty
Everything will be alright
People say that I am in love
But they can see it in my eyes
You're the prettiest girl I ever seen
Let's go see about another party
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
Is this real love I feel tonight
When you kiss me and hold me tight
How can I tell
I've got to be sure
If this is love we could enjoy
So come on
Let's sing in this party
Oh lordy miss Dotty
Everything will be alright
People say that I am in love
But they can see it in my eyes
You're the prettiest girl I ever seen
Let's go see about another party
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
