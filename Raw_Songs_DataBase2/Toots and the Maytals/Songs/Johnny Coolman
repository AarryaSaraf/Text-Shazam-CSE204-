They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
I wake up soon and I feel so good
And home just don't bother me
They call me Johnny Cool, Cool, Cool. Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
I was on the other hand
They take me for the other man
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother, bother me
They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
They said some things to make me change
They said some things to make me feel bad
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother me
