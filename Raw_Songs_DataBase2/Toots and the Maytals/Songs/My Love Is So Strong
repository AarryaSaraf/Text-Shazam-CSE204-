Every day you say
That you wish if I could go with you
Every night you keep on telling me
That you wish if I could follow you

Every time you keep on worrying, worrying me
That you wish if I could go with you

But it's a good thing I didn't follow you
Just to do those funny things you wanted me to do
Honey, you tried to, to bend my love, yeah
You made a fool of me

One time I know is not the same
When we used to play in the sun
We used to hold each other's hand
Remember we used to play in the pond

So all the good looks that you have
Would not break my heart
My old heart still remains the same
Honey, you tried to bend my love
And made a fool of me, yeah

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a look at my face
You will see that my future's still bright

Oh, bright as the sun in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine, yeah
Shine as the stars in the morning
The pattern in the sky, oh yeah

I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a good look at my face
You will see that my future is still bright

Oh, bright as the stars in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine
Shine as the morning stars
That shine on the sky, yeah, yeah

Oh, that good thing have been for you
Oh, you do those funny things
Avoiding me for good

Oh, my love is so strong
