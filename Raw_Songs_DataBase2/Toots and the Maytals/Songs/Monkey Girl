She called me the man in the jungle
She called me the big monkey man
She called me the man of the west side
She called me the man of today
So my heart despair me so
I can't take it anymore
Your uncle says to, says to tell you you're a monkey girl
You're a monkey girl
Want you tell me now
She called me the man of happiness
She called me the man in the back
She called me the man of happiness
She called me the big monkey man
Oh my heart despair me so
I can't take it anymore
Your uncle says to, says to tell you you're a monkey girl
You're a monkey girl
Want you tell me now
