And only you and only you and only you, my love
I need you
And only you and only you and only you, my love
I can't believe that you would fall for all the crap in this song
I can't believe that you would fall for all the crap in this song
I'll be true
Forever true, forever true, my love
Stay with you
Forever you, forever you, my love
I can't believe that you would fall for all the crap in this song
I can't believe that you would fall for all the crap in this song
I want you
And only you and only you and only you, my love
I need you
And only you and only you and only you, my love
Forever you, forever you, my love
And only you and only you and only you, my love
Forever you, forever you, my love
And only you and only you and only you, my love
I want you
And only you and only you and only you, my love
I need you
And only you and only you and only you, my love
