Lord I must know
If you've been weeping and wailing
Naughty, naughty
Who knows how that love had to linger on
Someone help

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

If you go the bad way
You must prepare to get bad pay
The seed you sow, girl
This you shall surely reap, my brother and sister

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

Lord have mercy now
(I feel the spirit)
Brother Moses got to be there
Also brother Peter got to be there
The sinners got to be there
I've got to be there too

Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate

If you are from Canada
If you are from America
If you are from Africa
If you are from Jamaica

You got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate
