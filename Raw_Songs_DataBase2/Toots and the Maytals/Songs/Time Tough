I go to bed but sleep won't come
Get up in the night
I couldn't fight my feelings
Early in the morning
It's just the same situation
Here comes the landlord just a knocking upon my door
You knockin' upon my door
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a job

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Sister Lee cannot bear it
And brother Lincoln hardly stand it now
They're crying night and day, louder and louder
Nobody to help them make their way
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time hard (Time hard)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Good times was leading the bad times
But now the bad times take over
When I was a little boy
I just keep on feeling it, feeling it, feeling it
Feeling it, wow get down

Eh, eh, eh

Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Can't blame the minister
And you can't blame the preacher
And you can't blame your brother
And you cannot blame your sister
Can't blame your friends
'Cause today is the judgement day
And that's why everyone have to pray

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher...
