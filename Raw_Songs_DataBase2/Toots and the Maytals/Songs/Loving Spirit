I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
Let me ask you about something brother
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel that spirit now? Yes, I feel it

Though he washed my people's slate
And he make it white as snow
He plant his footsteps on the sea
And he rides upon a star
So consecrate this now

I say, I got the loving spirit deep down in my soul
I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
This is such a situation deep down in my soul
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel the spirit? Yes, I feel it
