Get Up, Stand Up
Get Up, Stand Up
I was going... to see my love
And I was going
Get ready, brother

Get ready, sister
I was going... to see my love
I was flowing
Get on board the train

For the evening train would be too late
Get on board the train
For the evening train will be too late
But I don't hear it

Where is the evening train?
Sitting in the brightened sun
Waiting for the day to come
Wishing for the night to come

That won't help
Sitting in the brightened sun
That won't help
Each the night and day will come

That won't help
Get up now
Get up, stand up now
Sitting inside a soul

Crying every day for more
Crying every day for more
That won't help
Crying every day for more
Fly a bird in the evening sun

Burning out of control
Burning out of control
That won't help
See'mon, see'mon...
Get Up, Stand Up

Time is going down now
My summer love is fading
