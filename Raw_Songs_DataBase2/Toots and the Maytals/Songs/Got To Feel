Got to, got to, got to

Sure I saw you walking down the lane with another boy
And I just turned my face away and I walked a little faster
When you see me walking down the street with another girl
You just fuss around and try to work all your tricks on me

I know you would do that
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
Oh baby, do that

That's the way you want it
That's the way you like it
That's the way you love it
That's the way you want it

That's the way you need it
That's the way you love it
Hey baby, do you, do you
Do you, do you do

Got to, got to feel it
(Incomprehensible)
Get me, get me feel it

If you see me walking down the street with another girl
You just bust around and try to work all your tricks on me
So I saw you walking down the lane with another boy
And I just turned my face away and I walked a little faster

I know you would do that
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
Oh baby, do that

That's the way you want it
That's the way you like it
That's the way you love it
That's the way you want it

That's the way you need it
That's the way you want it
Hey baby, do you, do you
Do you, do you do

Get me, get me feel it

Get me, get me, got to feel it

So don't come around, knock on my door
I don't love you, I don't need you no more
Don't keep knocking upon my door
I don't love you, I don't need you no more
Don't keep knocking upon my door
