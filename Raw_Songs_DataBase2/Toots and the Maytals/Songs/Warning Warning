Let Decency counteract your dirty principles
That you possess, and be respectful
So that everyone can see
Why won't you utilize your brain
In the right way that you should
Well, if you don't change
I would assume that you would be doomed
Next to your tomb

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
Yes, I'm giving you a warning, warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

The way you moving now
That's not the way for a friend to move, no
If you don't change
I would assume that you would be doomed
Next to your tomb

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
I'm giving you a warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

Let Decency counteract your dirty principles
That you possess, and be respectful
So that everyone can see
Why won't you utilize your brain
In the right way that you should

I would assume that you would be doomed
Next to your tomb

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
Yes, I'm giving you a warning, warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
Yes, I'm giving you a warning, warning
Please don't take it for granted, no

I'm giving you a warning
Don't take it for granted, no
Yes, I'm giving you a warning, warning
Please don't take it for granted, no
