// Premature //

Let the girl go home
Let her go right home
She's underage
She's not fit for the preacher
Let the girl go go home
Let her go right home
She's underage
She's not fit for the Preacher
Only adults can go
To see the sweet carnal show
Lord she's the one little girl
Her mother ever had
And I'm the one little son
My father ever had
Mmm, hmm
Mmm, hmm
Let the girl go home
Let her go right home
She's underage
She's not fit for the preacher
She's only 14 going to 15
Lord she's the one little girl
Her mama ever had
I'm the one little son
My father ever had
Mmm, hmm
Mmm, hmm
As telling through the prophecy
Brother Moses tell it to me
As telling through the prophecy
Revelation rock it to me
Let the girl go home
Let her go right home
She's underage
She's not fit for the Preacher

Only adults can go
To see the sweet carnal show
Lord she's the one little girl
Her mama ever had
And I'm the one little son
My father ever had
Mmm, hmm
Mmm, hmm
If everybody premature
They're walking and singing
And begging for more
If everybody premature
They're walking and singing
And laughing for more
As telling through the prophecy
Moses tell it to me
As telling through the prophecy
Revelation rock it to me
You see the children shall be having children
You see the children shall be having children
You see the children shall be having children
Children children children
Children children children
Children children children
Children children children
A whole lot of children
Children
As telling through the prophecy
Mother tell it to me
As telling through the prophecy
Rastaman sock it to me

// Johnny Coolman //

They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
I wake up soon and I feel so good
And home just don't bother me
They call me Johnny Cool, Cool, Cool. Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
I was on the other hand
They take me for the other man
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother, bother me
They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
They said some things to make me change
They said some things to make me feel bad
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother me

// Pain In My Heart //

Pain in my heart
She's treating me cold
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows

Pain in my heart
Just won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be?
Lord, where can she be?

Another day, as again it is though
I want you to come back, come back
Come back, baby, 'til I get enough

A little pain in my heart
Just won't let me be
Wake up at restless nights
Lord and I can't even sleep

Stop this little pain in my heart

Another day as again it's rough
I want you to love me, love me, love me
Baby, 'til I get enough
Pain in my heart, a little pain in my heart

Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain

// Celia //

Hey, Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, you Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my house
Has gone with everything

She took my pop, she took my plates
She took my knife and fork
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

She took my bed, she took my spread
She took my pillows too
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Yeah Celi-Celi-Celia
Celia, Celia
Celia, oh Celia
Celia, oh Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my home
She's gone with everything

She took my shoes, took my socks
Took my pants and shirt
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Oh Celia, oh Celia
Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, oh Celia

I left my home for four long years
And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my house
She's gone with everything

She took my bed, she took my spread
She took my pillows, too
Ah everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Celia, oh Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
Oh Celia, oh Celia
Oh Celia, Celia
