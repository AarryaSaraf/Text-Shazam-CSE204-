Album: InTheDark

// In The Dark //

Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at

In the dark, there ain't no light
In the dark, (Lord) you cheat and lie
In the dark, you want to fuss and fight
(Hey, hey) In the dark, you will get no light

(Listen) People tell me love, love is true
They tell me love, what love can do
You keep on telling me love, endlessly
That's when you try to turn your back on me

I'm so lonely, I'm so blue
Good God, I keep on loving no one but you
No matter where you go, no matter where you roam
I know one day soon you'll want to come back home

Come on, Come on baby
Come back to me, yeah, yeah

Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at
Riddle me this, riddle me this, riddle me, riddle me that
I bet you don't know just where I'm at

// Time Tough //

I go to bed but sleep won't come
Get up in the night
I couldn't fight my feelings
Early in the morning
It's just the same situation
Here comes the landlord just a knocking upon my door
You knockin' upon my door
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a job

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Sister Lee cannot bear it
And brother Lincoln hardly stand it now
They're crying night and day, louder and louder
Nobody to help them make their way
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time hard (Time hard)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Good times was leading the bad times
But now the bad times take over
When I was a little boy
I just keep on feeling it, feeling it, feeling it
Feeling it, wow get down

Eh, eh, eh

Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher

Can't blame the minister
And you can't blame the preacher
And you can't blame your brother
And you cannot blame your sister
Can't blame your friends
'Cause today is the judgement day
And that's why everyone have to pray

Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher...

// Take A Look In The Mirror //

Listen
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, girl
You told me you love me
You told me you care
Three months after I saw you there
I whispered my name, so softly
You should remember the first time we met

I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

The second time I saw you there
I could not believe the scene, yeah
I've never been happy
I've always been blue
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, yeah now
I've never been happy
I've always been blue, Lord man

I take a look to the sea
And I caught those row boats looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

// Take Me Home, Country Roads //

Listen

Almost heaven, West Jamaica
True ridge mountains, shining down the river
All my friends there, older than those ridge
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads

I heard her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
Said "Son you remind me of my home far away"
And drivin' down the road I feel a sickness
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

All my memories, all gathered 'round her
My my lady swingin' through the water (water)
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, tears fall out my eyes

Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads

Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads

Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads

// Love's Gonna Walk Out On Me //

Every time I see your face
Something moves within my heart
And it thrills me to my soul
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe that baby
Love is gonna let me down
I see the morning sun
I know everything is alright
I could see you rushing to my door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
I can't believe what you're saying to me baby
Love is gonna let me down
I can see the morning sun
And knowing that everything, everything is alright
I can see you rushing through that door
And tell me that love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
