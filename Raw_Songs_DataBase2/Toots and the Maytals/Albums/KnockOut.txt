Album: KnockOut

// Careless Ethiopians //

So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone away
Hey, hey

They calling up an Antichrist
Each night and day
Pray for a God to come from outer space

So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have lost their way

Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
I said I wonder what you do
You gotta come my way
Come my way

Is they know not where they're going?
They've gone astray

// Never Get Weary //

I was down in the valley for a very long time
And I never get weary yet
I was down in the valley for a very long time
And I never get weary yet

I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family
I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family, with my poor family

I was born before Christopher Columbus, yeah
And I was born before the Ara wok Indians
Trying creation, before this nation
I always remember, I can't forget, wo, wo, wo

I was walking on the shore when they took me in the ship
And they throw me overboard
And I swung right out of the belly of the whale
And I never get weary yet

They put me in jail and I did not do no wrong
And I never get weary yet
Say they put me in jail and I didn't get no bail
And I never get weary yet, never get weary yet

I know, I was born before Christopher Columbus, yeah
And I was born before the Ara wok Indians
Trying creation, before this nation
I always remember, which I can't forget, oh, yeah

I was down in the valley for a very long time
And I never get weary yet
I was down in the valley for a very long time
And I never get weary yet

I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family
I was born and raised in a little old shack
With my poor family, with my poor family

Yes, I was born before Christopher Columbus, yeah
And I was born before the Ara wok Indians
Trying creation, before this nation
I always remember, I can't forget, wo

Oh, I never get weary
Well, I never get weary

// Beautiful Woman //

Yeah, she's such a beautiful woman
And she have so many ugly men
And when she go to the market place
She'd leave all characters at home, oh

And she walk like a lady
Act like a lady, don't ask me why
But when she start her conversation
Every one of her friends just cry of shame

Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy

Look here and here comes Billy
And he's one of her ugly men
He says, "Hello, friend"
Then I began to tell the story
About this beautiful woman that I have seen

Then Billy turns to me and said
"She's like every woman, it's the same"
Then I shake my head and said
"No, let me tell you Billy, I can't believe
Every woman could be the same"

Sing along
A hey, beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy

Look here, here comes good ol' Sam
Come to town, met this girl, fall in love
And the girl keep driving him crazy
She just actin' like a lady for a short time

And she walk like a lady, act like a lady
Don't ask me why
I know when she get warmed up
Then she get started
Then she get crazy
She'll take off every piece of her clothes in the street

Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy

Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
A beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy

Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman

// I Know We Can Make It //

I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can

I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

They say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead, ooh
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?

Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know

You say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?

Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know

I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can

I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

// Missing You //

If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life

Oh, oh, oh, you make me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me love you, oh, yeah

Keep on missing you, missing you, missing you
Everywhere I go, missing you, missing you, missing you
I keep on missing, missing, missing you
When I'm going to my bed, I keep on seeing you

If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
That your love was not for real, no way
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of scandalizing my name

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life

You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize

Oh, no, no, you made me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me l-l-love you, oh, yeah

I keep on, I keep on missing you
Everywhere I go, I keep on missing you
I keep on missing, missing
Early in the morning, late in the night

I said, missing you, missing you, missing you
When I take the plane, even when I'm on the ground
My heart beat goes around, all because of you
I don't know why, I keep on missing you, keep on seeing you

Somebody told me that you say, your love is going away
But somewhere or the other, I will see you there
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ah, oh
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ooh, yeah
I keep on missing you, missing you
