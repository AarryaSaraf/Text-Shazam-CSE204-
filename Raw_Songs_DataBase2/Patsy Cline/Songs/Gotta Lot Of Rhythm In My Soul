Come on dad, get with the jive
Let's let em' know that we're alive
Until the break of dawn
We'll yell for more, more, more
Gonna live it up an' tear it down
Get in the groove and paint the town
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Big bad beat with a crazy bop
When the lights are low and the music's hot
Dance from two to three and then a half past four
When that sun peeks over the hill
I won't stop, I'll be rockin' still
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul
