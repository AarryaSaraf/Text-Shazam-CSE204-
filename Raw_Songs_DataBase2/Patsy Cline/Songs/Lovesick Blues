Got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I do is sit and cry

Oh, Lord that last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do you, he'll do me
He's got that kinda loving
But, Lord, I love to hear him when he calls me

Sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems

I've grown used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me

Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leaving
This is all I've got to say

I got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord, since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues
