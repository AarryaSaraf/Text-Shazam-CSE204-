I've got my life in such a mess 
And I don't know what to do
How can I live in this old world 
And be in love with two

If I said goodbye to my first true love
My heart would break in two
For I'm halfway still in love with him
And half in love with you

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

I saw you at the movie show
Just the other day
But I was with my other love
So I looked the other way

I didn't want to hurt him
Couldn't bear for him to see
The way I would look at you
And the way you look at me

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

What'll I do about you, what'll I do about you,
