I've got your picture,
that you gave to me,
and it's signed with love,
just like it used to be.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got your picture, she's got you.

I've got the records,
that we used to share,
and they still sound the same,
as when you were here.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got the records, she's got you.

I got your memory,
or, has it got me?
I really dont know,
but i know is it wont let me be.

I've got your class ring, 
that proved you care,
and it looks the same,
as when you gave it dear.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got these little things, she's got you.

I've got your memory,
