// Faded Love //

As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines, that to me were so dear
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love

I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded love

// I'll Sail My Ship Alone //

We've been sweethearts for so long
But now you say we're thru
The love we shared is now a memory
I have built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you
But now I guess what is to be, will be

I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
Yes, I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails you've torn
And when it starts to sinkin'
I'll blame you

Now, I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S
I thought that you would come back home
My darlin', if you knew
How much my achin' heart was in distress

Well, I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
Yes, I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails you've torn
And when it starts to sinkin'
I'll blame you.

// Crazy Arms //

Blue is not the word for the way that I feel
And the storm brewing in this heart of mine
This is no treasured dream, I know that it's real
Your someone else's love now, you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be with
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

Please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be with
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

// Always //

Always, always
Always

I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always, always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always

Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
And, not for just a year, but always

// When I Get Thru With You (You'll Love Me Too) //

You think you love Sue
But when I get through with you
You won't ever look at Sue, again.

I'm gonna be so good to you
I'm gonna love you my whole life through
Pretty soon, you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name.

I'll give you kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.
When I get through with you
You'll love me true.

I'm gonna treat you so sweet and kind
I'll drive her right out of your mind
And you won't know her if you meet
Walk right by her on the street.

Because I want you and need you so
Poor Suzy, will have to go
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.
When I get through with you
You'll love me true.

I'm gonna be so good to you
I'll love you my whole life through
Pretty soon, you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name.

I'll give you kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true, not Sue.

When I get through with you
You'll love me true...

// Blue Moon Of Kentucky //

I said blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

It was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, love said goodbye

I said blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shinin' bright
Whispered on high, your lover said goodbye
I said blue moon of kentucky, keep on a-shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue
Left me blue

// Someday (You'll Want Me To Want You) //

I know that someday, you'll want me, to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
You expect me to be true, and keep on loving you
Tho' I am feeling blue, you think I can't forget you

Until someday you'll want me, to want you
When I am strong for somebody else
And although you don't want me now, 
I'll get along somehow
And then, I won't want you

I know that someday, you're gonna want me, to want you
When I am strong for somebody else
And although you don't want me now, 
I'm gonna get along, somehow
And then, I won't want you
I won't want you
And then, I won't want you...

// Who Can I Count On //

Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
I never counted on 
You makin' me blue
They say you're a-runnin round 
With somebody new
Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?

I thought I held a precious key to heaven
Your love was sweet and gentle at the start
But now I feel that I can't go on living
If livin' means that we must live apart.

Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
There goes my happiness 
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself
That we're really through
Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?

The door to happiness was almost open
Just one more step or two and I'd be in
Then all at once, the vows you made were broken
The door to happiness was closed again.

Who can I count on 
If I can't count on you?
There goes my happiness 
And here comes the blues
I can't convince myself 
That we're really through
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you?

Who can I count on?
Who can I count on?
Who can I count on
If I can't count on you?...

// Does Your Heart Beat For Me? //

Tho' we said goodbye
When the moon was high.
Does your heart beat, for me?
I wonder if I still linger
In your memory?

When you hear my name
Is the thrill the same?
As it once used to be
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart
Does your heart beat, for me?

(When you hear my name)
Hear my name
(Is the thrill the same)
Thrill the same
As it once used to be?
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart
Does your heart beat, for me?...
