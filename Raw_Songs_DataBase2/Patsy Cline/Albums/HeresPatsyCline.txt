// In Care Of The Blues //

Now, baby if you're needin' me
The way that I've been needin' you
Well, drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine
Write me in care of the blues

I hope that you've been missin' me
The way that I've been missin' you
I shouldn't have let you go
Because I love you so
Write me in care of the blues

Give that postman your letter
And he'll know what to do
He'll bring your letter to me
And a plane will bring me to you

Now, baby if you're needin' me
The way that I've been needin' you
Just drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine
Write me in care of the blues

Give that postman your letter
And he'll know what to do
He'll bring your letter to me
And a plane will bring me to you

Now, baby if you're needin' me
The way that I've been needin' you
Just drop me a line
Sayin' honey you'll be mine
Write me in care of the blues

Write me in care of the blues...

// Stop The World (And Let Me Off) //

Round 'n' around 'n' around
Round 'n' around 'n' around
Round 'n' around 'n' around
And around and around

Oh, stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' round 'n' round
I played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off

My heart is shattered, can't you see
'Cause you no longer care for me
But someday, I'm sure you'll see
Loving you did this to me

My dream world tumbled to the ground
The one I love has let me down
I lost the wonder of his kiss
How could he leave me here like this

Oh, stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' round 'n' round
I played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off

Lock all this burning up inside
I know his love for me has died
I lost the wonder of his kiss
How could he leave me here like this

Oh, stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of goin' round 'n' round
I played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off

// Yes, I Understand //

Yes, I understand that I'm to set you free
Yes, I understand you love her more than me
I understand she won your heart
Stoled your, love drew us apart
I understand (I understand)
And so I'll let you go (let you go)

I tried my best to do the things
I thought would please you dear
I never dreamed the time would come
When you would not be here

Yes I understand what I'm supposed to do
Find me someone else to take the place of you
And if I live a hundred years
I'll find some way to hide these tears
I understand (I understand)
And so I'll let you go

(I tried my best to do the things)
(I thought would please you dear)
I never dreamed the time would come
When you would not be here

Yes I understand what I'm supposed to do
Find me someone else to take the place of you
And if I live a hundred years
I'll find some way to hide these tears
I understand (I understand)
And so I'll let you go (Let you go)...

// Just Out Of Reach //

Love that runs away from me
Dreams that just won't let me be
Blues that keep on botherin' me
Chains that just won't set me free
Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two open arms

Each night in dreams I see your face
Memories time can't erase
I awake and find you gone
I'm so blue and all alone
So far away from lips so sweet and warm
Just out of reach of my two open arms

That ol' lonesome feelin' all the time
I know you'll never be mine
Dreams that hurt me in my sleep
I mean vows that we just couldn't keep

Too far away from you and all your charms
Just out of reach of my two open arms

// Life's Railway To Heaven //

Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Watch the curves, the fills, and tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eyes upon the rail

Blessed savior, thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that great forevermore

Blessed savior, thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that great forevermore

// If I Could See The World (Through The Eyes Of A Child) //

If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be
There'd be no trouble and no strife
Just a big happy life
With a bluebird in every tree

I could see right, no wrong
I could see good, no bad
I could see all the good things
In life I've never had
If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be

If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
Smiling faces would greet me all the while
Like a lovely work of art
It would warm my weary heart
Just to see thru the eyes of a child

I could see right, no wrong
I could see good, no bad
I could see all the good things
In life I've never had
If I could see the world
Thru the eyes of a child
What a wonderful world this would be

// I've Loved And Lost Again //

I've loved and lost again
Oh, what a crazy world we're livin' in
True love has no chance to win
I've loved and lost again.

I ask you what chance have I
When each love I meet just makes me cry
He loves awhile then says goodbye
I've loved and lost again.

To be true to one alone
Don't seem to matter anymore
They tell you you're out of style
Unless you've had three or four.

I've loved and lost again
Oh, what a crazy world we're livin' in
True love has no chance to win
I've loved and lost again.

To be true to one alone
Don't seem to matter anymore
They tell you you're out of style
Unless you've had three or four.

I've loved and lost again
Oh, what a crazy world we're livin' in
True love has no chance to win
I've loved and lost again...

// How Can I Face Tomorrow //

Tonight alone I 'm thinking 
Of the things we use to do
There's laughter all around me 
But my heart still aches for you

The wedding bells are ringing
But to me their chimes are blue
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you

The dreams we shared 
Have all been torn apart
It's your wedding day 
But I can't claim your heart

Now someone else will hold you 
Just the way I use to do
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you

The dreams we shared 
Have all been torn apart
It's your wedding day 
But I can't claim your heart

Now someone else will hold you 
Just the way I use to do
How can I face tomorrow 
When I know I'm losing you...

// Just A Closer Walk With Thee //

I am weak but thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me shall be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To thy kingdom's shore, to thy shore

When life's sun sinks in the west
Lord, may I have done my best
May I find sweet peace and rest
In that happy home of the blessed

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
