// A Church, A Courtroom And Then Goodbye //

The first scene was the church, then the altar 
Where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried 
Our friends wished us luck there forever 
As we walked from the church, side by side 

The next scene was a crowded courtroom 
And like strangers we sat side by side 
Then I heard the judge make his decision 
And no longer were we man and wife 

I hate the sight of that courtroom 
Where man-made laws push God's laws aside 
Then the clerk wrote our story in the record 
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye 

We walked from that courtroom together 
We shook hands and once again we cried 
Then it was the end of our story 
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye

// A Stranger In My Arms //

Tho' you try you can't conceal it
Love has brought us only storms
I can see your eyes revealin'
Your a stranger in my arms

Say goodbye to our romancing
We have lost the flame that warms
Tho' I hold you while we're dancing
Your a stranger in my arms

Ev'ry story has an ending
This is where our story ends
Please don't hurt me by pretending
For lovers never can be friends

Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll never want me
Your a stranger in my arms

Ev'ry story has an ending
This is where our story ends
Please don't hurt me by pretending
For lovers never can be friends

Thru the years your love will haunt me
And I'll dream about your charms
Still I know you'll never want me
Your a stranger in my arms

Your a stranger in my arms...

// Back In Baby's Arms //

[Chorus:]
I'm back in baby's arms 
How I missed those lovin' arms 
I'm back where I belong 
Back in baby's arms 

Don't know why we quarreled 
We never did before 
Since we found out how it hurt 
I bet we never quarrel anymore 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Thought I didn't need his love 
'Til he took it away 
Now I'm back where I belong 
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay 

[Repeat Chorus] 

Back in baby's arms...

// Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home //

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey? Won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know that I've done you wrong

Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yes, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?

Won't you come home, Bill Bailey? Won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'm gonna do your cooking, honey, I'm gonna pay your rent
I know that I've done you wrong
(Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?)

Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Well, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a dirty low down shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home

// Come On In (And Make Yourself At Home) //

Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

If I had one wish, I wish I could
Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

I'd sing their praises long and loud
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right
And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own
If I'd go back to hear them pray
In the little pine church, they all would say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

When I was a child of only three
I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from God I'd never roam
When I get my summons on the Judgment Day
I hope I can hear my Savior say
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

// Cry Not For Me //

Cry not for me, my love
When I am far away
There's nothing more to say
Cry not for me

Cry not for me, my love
You've found another thrill
And though I love you still
Cry not for me

Love is a golden rose
That grows within your heart
Unless the petals fade
And fall apart

Cry not for me, sweetheart
But if a tear should start
Cry not my broken heart
Cry not for me

(There is a golden rose)
(That grows within your heart)
Unless the petals fade
And fall apart

Cry not for me, sweetheart
But if a tear should start
Cry not for my broken heart
Cry not for me...

// Down By The Riverside //

Well I met my little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I met my little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked her for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I asked her for a little kiss
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
I said have patience little man
But I'm sure you'll understand
I hardly know your name
You said if I can have my way
Maybe some sweet day
Your name and my will be the same
Well I wed that little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Well I wed that little brown-eyed gal
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside

// Gotta Lot Of Rhythm In My Soul //

Come on dad, get with the jive
Let's let em' know that we're alive
Until the break of dawn
We'll yell for more, more, more
Gonna live it up an' tear it down
Get in the groove and paint the town
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Big bad beat with a crazy bop
When the lights are low and the music's hot
Dance from two to three and then a half past four
When that sun peeks over the hill
I won't stop, I'll be rockin' still
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul

// I Can See An Angel //

I can see an angel walking (walking)
Someone else is by his side (by his side)

// I Cried All The Way To The Altar //

I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face
But tears were in my heart

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Oh my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done

Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

// I'm Blue Again //

I'm blue again
My friends all said I'd be
I'm blue again
Because your leavin' me

This heart of mine
So well remembers you
Although I've lost your love
To someone new

The nights are long
So long, my darlin' hear me
I pray that dawn will come
And somehow, you'll be near me

I'm blue again
My heart is filled with tears
I'm blue again
As I think of wasted years

(The nights are long)
(So long my darlin' hear me)
I pray that dawn will come
And somehow, you'll be near me

I'm blue again
My heart is filled with tears
I'm blue again
As I think of wasted years...

// I'm Moving Along //

(Just movin' along, Just movin' along)
Well, I'm chasin' the blues
Right out of my mind
I'm leavin' my cares
And worries behind
'Cause I'm on my way
I'm leavin' town today

(Just movin' along, Just movin' along)
My lonesome old heart
Is broken into
I've been walkin' the floor
Every night over you
But our love is all gone
I'm movin' on
I'm a-leavin' town today (movin' along)

I got no love, no cares
Just heartaches
I'm leavin' them all behind
Like the sun and the moon
And the stars above
We're gonna be one of a kind

Well, I'm movin' along
I gotta be free
I'll find a new love
Wherever I'll be
But my old love is gone
I'm movin' on
I'm a-leavin' town today

(I got no love, no cares)
(No heartaches)
(I'm leavin' them all behind)
Like the sun, and the moon
And the stars above
We're gonna be one of a kind

Well I'm movin' along
I gotta be free
I'll find a new love
Wherever I'll be
But my old love is gone
I'm movin' on
I'm a-leavin' town today (along)
I'm leavin' this town today...
(Just movin' along, Just movin' along)...

// I've Got Your Picture //

I've got your picture,
that you gave to me,
and it's signed with love,
just like it used to be.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got your picture, she's got you.

I've got the records,
that we used to share,
and they still sound the same,
as when you were here.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got the records, she's got you.

I got your memory,
or, has it got me?
I really dont know,
but i know is it wont let me be.

I've got your class ring, 
that proved you care,
and it looks the same,
as when you gave it dear.

The only thing different, the only thing new.
I've got these little things, she's got you.

I've got your memory,
or, has it got me?
I really dont know, 
but I know, it wont let me be.

I've got your class ring, 
that proved you care,
and it still looks the same,
as when you gave it dear,

The only thing different, the only thing new
I've got these little things, she's got you.

// Leavin' On Your Mind //

If you got leavin' on your mind
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If you got leavin' on your mind

If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart

Don't leave me in a world
Filled with dreams that might have been
Hurt me now, get it over
I may learn to love again

If there's a new love in your heart
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart

Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart

// Let The Teardrops Fall //

Let the teardrops fall
You said you wasn't gonna call
You didn't love me at all
So let the teardrops fall

Since you've been gone
I've been so blue
And I spend my time
Just a-thinkin' of you

Well, I sit here at home
By my telephone
Hopin' you'll change your mind
Well, it's you I dream of
And I need your love
So tell me you'll be mine

'Cause the sun doesn't shine
And the moon, it won't glow
And these lonely nights
All pass too slow

Sweet memories
I still recall
But I miss you so
So let the teardrops fall

Well, I sit here at home
By my telephone
Hopin' you'll change your mind
Well, it's you I dream of
And I need your love
So tell me you'll be mine

'Cause the sun doesn't shine
And the moon, it won't glow
And these lonely nights
All pass too slow

Sweet memories
I still recall
But I miss you so
So let the teardrops fall...

// Love Letters In The Sand //

On a day like today
We pass the time away
Writing love letters in the sand

How you laughed when I cried
Each time I saw the tide
Take our love letters from the sand

You made a vow that you
Would always be true
But somehow, that vow
Meant nothin' to you

Now my poor heart just aches
With ev'ry wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand

You made a vow that you
Would always be true
But somehow, that vow
Meant nothing to you

Now my poor heart just aches
With ev'ry wave that breaks
Over love letters in the sand...

// Love, Love, Love Me, Honey Do //

My love is deeper than the world's deepest sea
My love is stronger than the mightiest tree
My love is real, my love is true
Darlin', you know that's the love I have for you

[Chorus:]
Well, love me, love me, honey do
You know I'll always be true
Love me honey, squeeze me tight
Hug me honey, with alla your might
Love me, love me, honey do

Your love is warmer than a bright shiny day
It makes me tingle, and I like it that way
Your love is sweet, sweet as can be
Darlin', please say that your love is all for me

[Chorus:]
Well, love me, love me, honey do
You know I'll always be true
Love me honey, squeeze me tight
Hug me honey, with alla your might
Love me, love me, honey do

My love is deeper than the world's deepest sea
My love is stronger than the mightiest tree
My love is real, my love is true
Darlin', you know that's the love I have for you

[Chorus:]
Well, love me, love me, honey do
You know I'll always be true
Love me honey, squeeze me tight
Hug me honey, with alla your might
Love me, love me, honey do

Love me, love me, honey do

Love me, love me, honey do...

// Lovesick Blues //

Got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
All I do is sit and cry

Oh, Lord that last long day he said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
He'll do you, he'll do me
He's got that kinda loving
But, Lord, I love to hear him when he calls me

Sweet baby
What a beautiful dream
I hate to think it all over
I lost my heart it seems

I've grown used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

Now I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love
I'm in love with a wonderful guy
But he don't care about me

Well, I tried and I tried to keep him satisfied
But he just wouldn't stay
But now that he is leaving
This is all I've got to say

I got a feeling 'cause I'm blue
Oh, Lord, since my daddy said goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
I lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I've got the lovesick blues

I've grown so used to that man, somehow
And I'm nobody's sugar-baby now
'Cause I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick blues

// Pick Me Up On Your Way Down //

Once my love was good enough
True happiness we knew
Then fame and fortune came your way
And made a change in you
You'll find your ladder of success
Is not on solid ground
And when it starts to tumble
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up when dreams are shattered
When false friends cannot be found
For you know I'll still be waiting
Pick me up on your way down

You've hit the top, but it won't last
There's just one way to go
The world you've chosen is not real
These things you'll come to know
When folks say they don't know you
And you've lost your final round
When you find that you are lonely
Pick me up on your way down

Pick me up when dreams are shattered
When false friends cannot be found
For you know I'll still be waiting
Pick me up on your way down

// Stop, Look And Listen //

Well, I know a cool cat from way downtown
He's been boppin' all around
In this ole world he's livin' fast
Someday I'm afraid he's gonna run outta gas
So if you're travelin' that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do.

Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way.

Now, Farmer Jones, he came to town
And saw that boppin' all around
He learned to do it, there's no doubt
I'm afraid someday he'll burn his motor out
So if you're travelin' that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do.

Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way.

First came the boogie, then the bunny hop
Now the rhumba, samba, then the bop
Well, I don't know what's a-comin' next
But this ole world's in a terrible fix
So, if you're travelin' that way, too
I tell you, friend, what you better do.

Ya gotta stop, look and listen
Hey, ya don't know what you're missin'
Ya gotta stop, look and listen
'Cause ya might be missin' kissin'
If you're trav'lin' slow, you'll go a long, long way.

Ya gotta stop, look and listen.
Ya gotta stop, look and listen.
Ya gotta stop, look and listen.
Ya gotta stop...

// Sweet Dreams //

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, it's plain
I should know, I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

// The Heart You Break May Be Your Own //

You think you're smart
You broke my heart
Left me to cry here alone
But you'll return
One day you'll learn
The heart you break may be your own.

You promised me
Your love would be
A kind I'd never known
Tho' you weren't fair
You're unaware
The heart you break may be your own.

You used my heart for a plaything
You'll be sorry, just wait and see
One day you'll find you are lonely
And the first one you'll think of is me.

You'll look around
And when you've found
That you are all alone
Then you'll get wise
And realize
The heart you break may be your own.

You used my heart for a plaything
You'll be sorry, just wait and see
One day you'll find you are lonely
And the first one you'll think of is me.

You'll look around
And when you've found
That you are all alone
Then you'll get wise
And realize
The heart you break may be your own...

// There He Goes //

There he goes, he's walking away
Each step he takes brings heartaches my way
She won his heart, I lost him some way
There he goes, he's walking away

If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one walking by his side
I love him still and I guess that it shows
He's walking away, there he goes

If I hadn't cheated and I hadn't lied
I'd be the one walking by his side
I love him still and I guess that it shows
He's walking away, there he goes

// Today, Tomorrow And Forever //

How warm is the love in my heart for you
As warm as the sun in the sky of blue
How long will it shine if you say you're mine
Today, tomorrow and forever

How strong was my love from the very start
How long will it last in my happy heart
How much would I cry if we'd ever part
Today, tomorrow and forever

'Cause if you weren't there to share my love
Who cares if the sky should fall
For anyone can see how much you mean to me
You're my life, my love, my very all

And as long as the tides of the ocean flow
As long as the trees and the flowers grow
So long, oh my love, will I love you so
Today, tomorrow and forever

'Cause if you weren't there to share my love
Who cares if the sky should fall
For anyone can see how much you mean to me
You're my life, my love, my very all

And as long as the tides of the ocean flow
As long as the trees and the flowers grow
So long, oh my love, will I love you so
Today, tomorrow and forever

Today... Tomorrow... And forever....

// Tra Le La Le La Triangle //

I've got my life in such a mess 
And I don't know what to do
How can I live in this old world 
And be in love with two

If I said goodbye to my first true love
My heart would break in two
For I'm halfway still in love with him
And half in love with you

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

I saw you at the movie show
Just the other day
But I was with my other love
So I looked the other way

I didn't want to hurt him
Couldn't bear for him to see
The way I would look at you
And the way you look at me

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, my life's in such a tangle 
Tra le la le la la triangle, tra le la le la la triangle
Tra le la le la la triangle, what'll I do about you

What'll I do about you, what'll I do about you,

// Turn The Cards Slowly //

Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Please don't double-deal to win my heart
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Don't go breakin' rules right from the start

The ramblin', gamblin', reckless way 
You treat my heart's a sin
Each night down on my knees I pray 
Your gamblin' ways will end
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on

Now, turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Please don't double-deal to win my heart
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
Don't go breakin' rules right from the start

The ramblin', gamblin', reckless way 
You treat my heart's a sin
Each night down on my knees I pray 
Your gamblin' ways will end
Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin', darlin'
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on

Turn the cards slowly while you're dealin' 'em, darlin',
And if you stack the deck, then I'll move on...

// Walkin' After Midnight //

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

I stop to see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just hoping you may be 
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

// When I Get Thru With You //

You think you love Sue
But when I get through with you
You won't ever look at Sue again

I'm gonna be so good to you
I'm gonna love you my whole life through
Pretty soon you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name
I'll give ya kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me too, not Sue
When I get through with you
You'll love me too

I'm gonna treat you so sweet and kind
I'll drive her right outta your mind
And you won't know her if you meet
Walk right by her on the street
Because I want you and need you so
Poor Susie you will have to go
When I get through with you
You'll love me too, not Sue
When I get through with you
You'll love me too

I'm gonna be so good to you
I'll love you my whole life through
Pretty soon you'll feel the same
You won't even know her name
I'll give you kisses that she can't beat
I'll treat you so nice and sweet
When I get through with you
You'll love me too, not Sue
When I get through with you
You'll love me too, not Sue
When I get through with you
You'll love me too, not Sue

// Why Can't He Be You //

He takes me to the places you and I used to go
He tells me over and over that he loves me so
He gives me love that I never got from you
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you

He never fails to call and tell me I'm on his mind
And I'm lucky to have such a guy, I hear it all the time
And he does all the things that you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you

He's not the one who dominates my mind and soul
And I should love him so cause he loves me I know
But his kisses leave me cold

He sends me flowers, calls on the hour just to prove his love
And my friends say that when he's around I'm all he speaks of
And he does all the things that you would never do
He loves me too, his love is true
Why can't he be you
