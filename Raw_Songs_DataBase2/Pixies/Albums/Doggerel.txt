// Nomatterday //

You know, I know that you don't really hate me
But I suppose that I probably irritate you
And furthermore I know that I can relate to you
I'll say I'm sorry in advance for all of my hyperbole
Don't waste your time on me
Don't waste your time on me

And you know, I really, really, really care for you
But I see lately you're a little absentee
I'm sure that you have had your fair share, your fair share of me
So why do you come here lately after all that we've been through?
Don't waste my time on you
Don't waste my time on you

It's Nomatterday, here we go again
Necromancers bending to and fro
Feels like a Saturday
That never seems to end

Feast of burden that-away
Beast of famine that-away
Easter Bunny that-away

I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain
I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain

It's Nomatterday, I call up all my friends
And we go dancing at the show
But when the spirits call
It's all shenanigans

Feast of burden that-away
Beast of famine that-away
Easter Bunny that-away

I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain
I said hey-ey-ey-ey
Don't piss in the fountain
I said whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Don't piss in the fountain

I said hey
I said whoa
I said hey
I said whoa

// Vault Of Heaven //

Here in the vault of heaven
While trying to titrate
I ended up in another case

I went to 711
To try and get me straight
I ended up there in outer space

There in the vault of heaven
Trying to titrate
I ended up in some dire straits
And that's OK

Again to 711
'Cause I think they're pretty great
I ended up here flat on my face

Here in the vault of heaven
Just trying to keep me straight
But I ended up still in outer space

Here in the vault of heaven
Trying to titrate
I ended up in some dire straits
But that's ok

// Dregs Of The Wine //

While I prefer the original version of 'You Really Got Me'
She will defer to the Van Halen version

Took the boat to the Hacienda
Through swimming pools oh so placid
Saw Redd Foxx took a hit of acid
Saw the smiling queen of Thailand

And then it's time to go
I said it's time to go
Are we gonna make it?
Are we gonna make it?
We gotta face it
Are we gonna make it?

We done run out of all our tricks
We flew a plane with lion tamers
Back to Brazil in 66
End of the world and I don't blame her

And then it's time to go
It's really time to go
But are we gonna make it?
Are we gonna make it?
We gotta face this
Are we gonna make it?

Drinking the dregs of the wine
Under the Hollywood sign
Drinking the dregs of the wine
'Til it's gone

Drinking the dregs of the wine
Under the Hollywood sign
Drinking the dregs of the wine
There's no more

It has the charm of hepcat circuit jazz
It has the swagger of a snake with arms

// Haunted House //

There's a house in English bond
Somebody planned to stay
Standing out near the button pond
It never went away

How many fish do make the shoal?
I cannot count today
What is your wish for these button holes?
I think I want to stay

Haunted house all full of ghosts
I'm gonna pass that way
Haunted house where I want to go
I'm gonna go today

North or south is the only way
I know I cannot tire
A haunted house that's built to stay
Is setting me on fire

Haunted house all full of ghosts
I'm gonna pass that way
Haunted house where I want to go
I'm gonna go today

Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go
Haunted house where I want to go

Somebody planned to stay
It never went away

// Get Simulated //

I don't have pills or the thrills to survive
Some say I've never lived but I know I'm alive
You always say that I'm living in my head
But I will cry for you long after you're dead

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Don't have a bike, I don't go out very much
All I ever wanted was your skin for to touch
I'll always love you, I will always say your name
But if you join me then I'll know you feel the same

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Let it be said I'm a little narcissist
But my favorite rock and roll is Sealed With A Kiss

Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now
Get simulated, I really get me down now

Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated
Get simulated

// The Lord Has Come Back Today //

Today's the day
That we're closest to the sun
And everyone's invited
But anyway
Tomorrow comes
In this we are united

Favorite line
From a song that'll take you back
Out of the blue into the black

Favorite sign
That the Lord ain't coming back
You break your mama if you step on a crack

Good times
'Cause I know that today is the day
Good signs
Yes, the Lord has come back today

Lose your mind
Then you going to lose track
For all the things for what you lack

Good times
'Cause I know that today is the day
Good signs
Yes, the Lord has come back today

Today's the day
That we're closest to the sun
And everyone's invited
But anyway
Tomorrow comes
In this we are united

// Thunder And Lightning //

There was a storm today in Chinatown
My favorite vegetable was really coming down

Okay, you count the miles till lightning turns to thunder
How long until it tears us both asunder?

They started a war today in another land
Everything went the way that it all was planned

Okay, you count the miles till lightning turns to thunder
How long until it tears us both asunder?

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho

Okay, you count the miles till lightning turns to thunder
How long until it tears us both asunder?

There was a storm today in Chinatown
You count the miles till lightning turns to thunder
How long until it tears us both asunder?

There was a storm today
There was a storm today
You count the miles till lightning turns to thunder
You count the miles till lightning turns to thunder

// There's A Moon On //

Day after day seems about the same
Same old people playing same old games
But some days are different when the moon
Shines bright
There's a storm in your brain on a full moon night

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on

Don't like to fight don't like to spit
Don't like a steak with no pepper on it
No, I don't like to spit and I don't like to fight
I won't like to be alone on a full moon night

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on

I can make like a dog and give my tail a shake
Make like a frog and go jump in a lake
Make like a cock and cock-a-doodle do
Make like I'm gonna make love to you

There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on
There's a moon on

// Pagan Man //

Once it's gone you'll know
Tides and moons ago
Pagan man, you're miles away

Once a younger moon
Inside this castle new
And you will be miles away

Pagan man, pagan man
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you

Once it's gone you'll know
Inside this castle shows
Pagan man, you're miles away

Once upon a time
Many moons from now
You will be miles away

Pagan man, pagan man
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you

// Who's More Sorry Now? //

I swept the closet floor
I found some metaphors
A pair of running shoes
And something overdue

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

See how much we owe
Not much I suppose
For Henry David Thoreau

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

Don't split your sails over me
No, no
'Cause it just don't matter
Don't split your sails over me
No, no
'Cause it just don't matter

I found a mannequin
Inside a plastic bin

I said but who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
Who's more sorry now
You know, you know, you know

Don't split your sails over me
No, no, no
'Cause it just don't matter
Don't split your sails over me
No, no, no
'Cause it just don't matter

// You're Such A Sadducee //

You're such a sadducee, so yeah
It's just so sad to see, how's that?
You're such a sadducee
It's just so sad to see

Your messages to me aren't bad
You've such economy and tact
You've such economy
Like deuteronomy

You think that you and me should chat
But your soliloquy's a drag
I think that you and me
Are like ventriloquy

I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
You're burning it down

// Doggerel //

Three pretty boys did Gabriel get
The youngest George by name, Sir
A funny dog, not favoured much
By fortune or by fame, Sir

Down in the cold rain
Down the valley
Bottom of the hill
1st Baron Coleraine
Gabriel Hanger
Has sent a bell

On the road to somewhere
On the road to nowhere
It's the same to me
With a band of robbers
Or down the bottom
Bottom of the sea

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you
Here with you

I'm gonna stay to the end
I'm gonna stay to the end

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

I'll never wander again
I'll never wander again
I'm gonna stay to the end
Here with you

Wander again
Wander again
Gonna stay to the end
Here with you
Wander again
Wander again
