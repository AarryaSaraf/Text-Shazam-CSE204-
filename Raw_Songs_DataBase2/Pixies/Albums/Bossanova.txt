// Velouria //

hold my head
we'll trampoline
finally through the roof
on to somewhere near
and far in time
velouria
her covering 
travelling career
she can really move
oh velveteen!

my velouria, my velouria
even i'll adore you
my velouria

say to me
where have you been 
finally through the roof
and how does lemur skin
reflect the sea?

we will wade in the shine of the ever
we will wade in the shine of the ever
we will wade in the tides of the summer
every summer
every summer
every
my velouria
my velouria

forevergreen
i know she's here
in California
i can see the tears 
of shastasheen

my velouria, my velouria
even i'll adore your
my velouria

// Allison //

from distant star
to this here bar
the me, the you
where are we now?
horray the blues
of everyone
allison

keeps a smile
around a while
he took no fright
and jettisoned
we'll go tonight
to hear him tell
"oh well"
allison
allison

and when the planet hit the sun
i saw the face of allison
allison
allison

// Is She Weird //

i know you're rich in
good clothes and little things
your mind is fancy
(and your car is bitchin')

is she weird
is she weird, is she white
is she promised to the night
and her head has no room
and her head has no room

your heart is ripshit
your mouth is everywhere
i'm lyin' in it

is she weird
is she over me
like the stars and the sun
like the stars and the sun
is she weird
is she weird, is she white
is she promised to the night
and her head has no room!

no more of this girl cryin'
i'm here, your big man
you're mine

is she weird, is she white
is she promised to the night
and her head has no room

// Ana //

she's my fave
undressing in the sun
return to sea - bye
forgetting everyone
eleven high
ride a wave

// All Over The World //

with a pet at my side
God in the sky
snow falling down
freeze my body to the ground
i can't ride
but one more time
i will ride
all over the world

washed over the side
top of the sky
slow diver down
two feet land on a different fround
you can't live easily
you can't even speak
but all of them speak
all over the world

i will meet you over there
i am going to meet you over there
washed over the side
top of the sky
slow diver down
two feet land on a different ground
you can't live easily 
you can't even speak
fish all of them speak
all over the world

a plain with no herd
not even a bird
when one side is hot
the other side of the moon is not
it's just like a ride
maybe some time 
they'll make it a ride
all over the world

i will meet you over there
i am going to meet you over there

time is an arrangement
time is an arranger
i am a derangement

all my thoughts
all i am are my thoughts
all my thoughts
i am all what i'm taught

better call the ranger
got a train derailments
better call the ranger

what i'm taught
all i am are my thoughts 
all my thoughts
all i am are my thoughts
what i'm not

// Dig For Fire //

there is this old woman
she lives down the road
you can often find her
kneeling inside of her hole
and i often ask her
"are you looking for the mother lode?"
huh?
no.
no my child, this is not my desire
and then she said

i'm digging for fire [4x]

there is this old man 
who spent so much of his life sleeping
that he is able to keep awake for the rest of his years
he resides
on a beach
in a town
where i am going to live
and i often ask him
"are you looking for the mother lode?"
huh?
no.
no my child, this is not my desire
and then he said

i'm digging for fire [4x]

// Down To The Well //

down to the well

betty always knows
betty always tells
she laughing desperately
she said it felt like a river inside her bones
when she went down to the well

gonna be with her
she is gonna take me there
lead me by my hand
her body a rocking chair for my soul

i can hardly wait, baby
i can hardly wait
'til we go down to the well
down to the well

been thinking to myself
and if a life's not long
what matter does it make
if there'll be favorite songs playing in my head
when we go down to the well

i can hardly wait, betty
i can hardly wait
'till we go down to the well
down to the well

// The Happening //

they got a ranch they call
number fifty-one
they got a ranch they call
number fifty-one
can't see it all
'less your flying by
just sitting there square
baking in the sun
beneath the sky

they're gonna put it down
right on the strip
they're gonna put it down
on the Vegas strip
they're gonna put it down
and step outside
into the lights
right outta that ship
saying Hi!

i was driving doing nothing on the shores of Great Salt Lake
when they put it on the air i put it in the hammer lane
i soon forgot myeslf and i forgot about the brake
i forgot all laws and i forgot about the rain
they were talking on the 9 and all across the amy band
across the road they were turning around and headed south with me
it got so crowded on the road i started driving in the sand
my head was feeling scared but my heart was feeling free
the desert turned to mud it seems that everybody heard
everybody was remembering to forget they had the chills
then i heard the voices on a broadcast from up on the bird
they were getting interviewed by some Goodman whose name was Bill
i'm almost there to Vegas where they're puttin' on a show
they've come so far i've lived this long at least i must just go and say
hello

// Blown Away //

now the sun is burning 
in deepest space
that's the way things are
through a storm i called you
it fell each day
i didn't get so far
my words get blown away

my lips are moving 
if you touch my face
did you hear my scream?
while we were sleeping
i tried to say
even in my dreams
my words get blown away

now the sun is burning 
in deepest space
i didn't get so far

// Hang Wire //

they're going higher
wind is whistling on the barbs
your head's a hammer

hang wire, hang wire
hang wire
(meet you at the) hang wire

that man is a liar
the day is like a warm night
salt rusts the cold line

hang wire, hang wire
hang wire
(meet you at the) hang wire

every morning and every day
i'll bossanova with ya

if there were a fire
can we scratch beneath this

hang wire, hang wire
hang wire
(meet you at the) hang wire?

// Stormy Weather //

It is time
It is time

For stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
For stormy weather

For stormy weather
For stormy weather
For stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
For stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
For stormy weather

For stormy weather
For stormy weather
For stormy weather
For stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
It is time for stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
It is time for stormy weather

It is time
It is time
It is time
It is time for stormy weather

Havalina
Walking in the breeze
On the plains of old Sedona
Arizona
Among the trees
