Album: HeadCarrier

// Head Carrier //

Head carrier, head carrier

Hey, Rusty come hold Luther's hand
It's deja-vu it's not like I planned
Looks like I'm going where I've already been

I'm going down the drain, again

Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)

Is this really worth it? I got a prison cough
A three-headed monster cut Denny's head right off
You can't be too chill, you can't be too zen

I'm going down the drain, again
I'm going down the drain, again
I'm going down the drain, again

Up the hill to have him killed
And he still hadn't died
He talked awhile and walked six mile
Down to riverside

Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)

// Classic Masher //

Saw you coming my way
Put my nose in a book
Some crap that you gave me
Or something that I took

Man, he looked so good
It had to be ooze leather
He's so together
Oozing like I never could

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you

He's playing dumb
You're looking at clothes
Straightening his hat
Mr. Shnook ho-hum

I shoulda shook his hand
I never used to feel bad
I never felt so blue
Guess I never amused you

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you

I bet he's a classic masher
He toot-toots when he likes the view
Tête-à-tête with his haberdasher
They talk boots while they're laughing at you (talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you (talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you (talk boots while they're laughing at you)
They talk boots while they're laughing at you (talk boots while they're laughing at you)

// Baal's Back //

I bet you thought that I was dead and gone
You wouldn't know that something's even on
And when you're lying on the silver tracks
No difference to me

You don't know that you're a sacrifice
All my love has turned back into ice
People, when the sky is turning black
You'll know that it's me

Are you saving, are you saving it for me
Are you saving all your precious love for me

Are you saving, are you saving it for me
Are you saving all your precious love for me

Baal's back

I bet you thought that I was dead and gone
You wouldn't know that something's even on
People, when the sky is turning black
You'll know that it's me

Are you saving, are you saving it for me
Are you saving all your precious love for me

Are you saving, are you saving it for me
Are you saving all your precious love for me

Baal's back
Baal's back
Baal's back

// Might As Well Be Gone //

You're the chosen one
But I could use a change
Even golden suns
Find the end of their reign

You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
That's my speech
That's my song

In the streets tonight
But the bars are all closed
We could meet tonight
But you're only a ghost

You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
Yeah, you might as well be gone
That's my speech
That's my song

You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
You might as well be gone
Yeah, you might as well be gone
That's my speech
That's my song

// Oona //

Her place was like an eyrie
The fall seemed very scary
Down to the strand
Please, I wanna be in your band

I see her body swaying
I hear her fingers playing
Her parlor grand
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

And automatic writing
I hear they do it nightly
Her wild jams
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

I hear her fingers playing
Her parlor grand
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band
Please, I wanna be in your band

Oona, I will await destruction
Oona, I will await destruction
My owner, I'm Oona's

// Talent //

I met this real cool dude today
Looking like Jack Palance
He said I wanna get through to you
And help you find your talent
He said that if I had a certain style
Then stuff would start to happen
He said that soon he was going away
'Cause he's a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
He's a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
He's a major talent
(I don't know)

I said that he was getting through to me
And I would take his challenge
And maybe soon I'd be going away
'Cause I had certain talents

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside
I'm a major talent

Talent - fighting on the Eastside
Talent - taking on the Westside
Talent - fucking up the Northside

I met this dude today
Down in the sewers of Paris
Was hiding from the sun
What a waste of talent

// Tenement Song //

The drumsticks were his treasure trove
Found in the ashes of The Cocoanut Grove

Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something?
Hey, man, nothing comes from nothing
Hey, man, something came from somewhere

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

(Tenement song)
(Tenement song)
Tall bottle and one more smoke
(Tenement song)
She lived through the fire but the piano got broke
(Tenement song)

Hey, man, can you give me something?
Hey, man, did you give me something?

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on

Hey, man, it's a tenement song
It's just there on the tip of your tongue
Let's play on a tenement song
On and on and on
(On and on and on)

// Bel Esprit //

He did his little dance
There up in the north of Spain
Danced all the way to France
Just to try and bring her rain

That's the way of this man

He rolled away the stone
With a plastic crucifix
'Cause he'd rather get his kicks
Than be here all alone

That's the way of this man

He's not much of a bel esprit
She can't seem to understand him
A bit more like a chimpanzee

She thinks he has no soul
'Cause he never learned to crawl

That's the way of this man

And he can only sing
Of his incipient love

That's the way of this man

He's not much of a bel esprit
She can't seem to understand him
A bit more like a chimpanzee

That's the way of this man
That's the way of this man

That's the way of this man
That's the way of this man

// All I Think About Now //

I try to think about tomorrow
But I always think about the past

About the things that didn't last

If I could go to the beginning
Then for sure I would be another way

Make it better for today

If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way

Make it better for today

Remember when we were happy?
If I'm late can I thank you now?

I'm gonna try anyhow

I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now

That's all I think about now

I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now

If you have any doubt
I want to thank you anyhow

// Um Chagga Lagga //

Well I'm headed south but kinda west
Up around the bend, one more breath
Standing tall in the rows of corn
Like Cora Pearl at ten in the morn

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga in the Languedoc
Um chagga lagga in the Languedoc

Black coal night in Wallonia sticks
Saw your red light burn for like twenty clicks

(Come on, man)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga in Wallonia sticks
Um chagga lagga in Wallonia sticks

But I'll just keep on driving
Don't get mixed up in shit
You could get used to it

I lost my way in the Tramontane
Cause that crazy stuff got in my brain
So I walked the marsh at Bouches-du-Rhône
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
And all night long I heard you moan
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Um chagga lagga at Bouches-du-Rhône
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm

But I'll just keep on walking
It's starting to hit me
They're coming to get me

Aah, um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga at Bouches-du-Rhône
Um chagga lagga at Bouches-du-Rhône
Um chagga lagga at the gravy station
Um chagga lagga at the gravy station
Um chagga lagga in San Antone
Um chagga lagga in San Antone

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road

Um chagga lagga on the side of the road (Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road (Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road (Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)
Um chagga lagga on the side of the road (Um chagga lagga on the side of the road)

They're coming to get me

// Plaster Of Paris //

You look like a praying mantis
You could say that the bug is man
Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster

Paint my picture and I'll paint you
You're not like others you ain't
Running down the hill I thought I passed her
Last chance before they give it the plaster

I can't dance but I don't wanna bore ya
Last line from the Cephalophore
I'll be the son of a son of a son of a bastard
Last chance before they give it the plaster

Big joke or a small disaster
Last chance before they give it the plaster

// All The Saints //

All the saints that I love
Some below some above
From this world they were torn
From their seed I was born

Wondering why I'm still here
Too many times I had fear
Trying to be near you
