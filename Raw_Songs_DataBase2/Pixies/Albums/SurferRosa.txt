// Vamos //

Estaba pensando sobreviviendo con mi sister en New Jersey, *

Ella me dijo que es una vida buena alla,

Bien rica bien chevere, Y voy!  Puneta! 

[TRANSLATION]


I was thinking surviving with my sister in New Jersey, *

She told me it's a good life there,

Very good very nice, Here I Go!  Jerk off!


We'll keep well bred,

We'll stay well fed,

We'll have our sons,

They will be all well hung.


They'll come and play,

Their friends will say,

Your daddy's rich,

Your mamma's a pretty thing.


That maid Maria she's really O.K.


Vamos a jugar por la playa [x5]
[Let's go play by the beach]


I keep getting friends,

Looking like lesbians,

If we get bored,

We'll move to California.


They'll come and play,

Their friends will say,

Your daddy's rich,

Your mamma's a pretty thing.


That maid Maria she's really O.K.


Vamos a jugar por la playa [x5]

// Bone Machine //

This is a song for Carol

You're into Japanese fast food
And I drop you off with your Japanese lover
And you go to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
They taste a bit like everyone
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

Your bones got a little machine

You're the bone machine

I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep, yep, yep,

I make you pray you make me hard
Your Irish skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

Your bones got a little machine

You're the bone machine

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

Your bone's got a little machine

// Break My Body //

I'm the hard looser

You'll find me crashing through my mother's door

I am the ugly lover

You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor


Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones  [3x]


I'm a belly dancer

I'll shake forever and I'll never care

I'm a building jumper

Roof to roof you see me flying in the air


Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones  [3x]


Somebody got hurt

Somebody get hurt

Somebody got her

// Something Against You //

Here it comes...

?


I have something against you

You have something against me

I have something against you


?


You have something against me

I have something against you

And I'm gonna use it

I am one happy prick

// Broken Face //

I got a broken face

I got a

I got a broken face

Uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu, ooo

I got a broken face  [3x]


There was this boy who had two

Children with his sisters

They were his daughters

They were his favourite lovers


I got no lips, I got no tongue

Where there were eyes there's only space

I got no lips, I got no tongue


I got a broken face, uh-hu, uh-hu

I got a broken face


There was this man who snapped his poke

In little pieces

And then they drilled holes

And then they put 'em back in there


I got no lips, I got no tongue

Where there were eyes there's only space

I got no lips, I got no tongue


I got a broken face

Uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu, uh-hu, ooo

I got a broken face


The little thing who loves my laundry

Speaks no English

But if you saw her

You'd say "Hey isn't she lovely"


I got no lips, I got no tongue

Where there were eyes there's only space

I got no lips, I got no tongue

// Gigantic //

And this I know

His teeth as white as snow

What a gas it was to see him

Walk her every day

Into a shady place

With her lips she said

She said


Hey Paul, Hey Paul, Hey Paul, let's have a ball  [3x]


Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love


Lovely legs they are

What a big black mess

What a hunk of love

Walk her every day into a shady place 

He's like the dark, but I'd want him


Hey Paul, Hey Paul, Hey Paul, let's have a ball  [3x]


Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love


Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic

A big big love

// River Euphrates //

Ride, ride, ride, ...


Stuck here out of gas

Out here on the Gaza Strip

From driving in too fast


Let's ride the Tiger down river Euphrates


Ride, ride, ride, ...


Dead sea make it float

One sip from the salty wine

Dead sea make you choke


Let's ride the Tiger down river Euphrates

// Where is My Mind //

Oh - stop

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except a little fish bumped into me
Swear he was trying to talk to me, coy koi

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?

Way out in the water
See it swimmin'

Oh
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Oh
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Oh
Oh

// Cactus //

Sitting here wishing on a cement floor

Just wishing that I had just something you wore


I put it on when I grow lonely

Will you take off your dress and send it to me?


I miss your kissin' and I miss your head

And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

Run outside in the desert heat

Make your dress all wet and send it to me


I miss your soup and I miss your bread

And a letter in your writing doesn't mean you're not dead

So spill your breakfast and drip your wine

Just wear that dress when you dine


P I X I E S


Sitting here wishing on a cement floor

Just wishing that I had just something you wore


Bloody your hands on a cactus tree

Wipe it on your dress and send it to me


Sitting here wishing on a cement floor

Just wishing that I had just something you wore

// Tony's Theme //

This is a song about a superhero named Tony

It's called Tony's Theme


He's got the oil on his chain, for a ride in the rain

No baloney

Ride around on my bicycle like a pony

I'm waving hi, hi, hi, hi, hi

Gu-gu-gu-Gimme a scream

Give me, give me the theme

Of Tony


To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny


I am Tony, super bicycle Tony, I'm racing

Spitfire turn and pop a wheelie, burn and evil chasing

I'm waving bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

I got a card in my spokes

I'm practicing my joke, I'm learning


To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny


This is a song about a superhero named Tony

It's called Tony's Theme


I can look at the sun if you give me some bad sun glasses

I'm back on the road, I cut my grass like I'm told

AFTER CLASSES!


To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny

To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny, To-ny

To-ny

// I'm Amazed //

- ...girls and fucked 'em at school

All I know is that

There were rumours he was into field hockey players

There were rumours

- So I applied basically

- He was gone the next day

- I went out for the team

- It's like - he was go... [Kim stops halfway through the word "gone"] - they'd just like

It was like so hush hush

They were so... quiet about it

And then the next thing you know...


The day before that I was wed

She went upstairs and she cut her hair away


I'm amazed [3x]


And when I was a little boy

A ball of string my parents took from me


I'm amazed [3x]


Before I died, I took my Honda

And packed it up, up, up to Arizona (honey)


I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed [4x]

// Brick Is Red //

A fist is fast

And Jimmy's cast

Hang me


A white moon's hot

The other side's not

Hang me


It's not time for me for me to go

It's not time for me for me to go


My eyes have turned

Just the color of diamond

Just the color

The frayed color of ice
