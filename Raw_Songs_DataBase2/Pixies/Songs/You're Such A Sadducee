You're such a sadducee, so yeah
It's just so sad to see, how's that?
You're such a sadducee
It's just so sad to see

Your messages to me aren't bad
You've such economy and tact
You've such economy
Like deuteronomy

You think that you and me should chat
But your soliloquy's a drag
I think that you and me
Are like ventriloquy

I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
I'm turning around
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
You're burning it down
