Beneath the bebop moon
I want to croo
With you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I got to be the one
With you, with you

My life's a shadowless horse
If I can't get across
To you
In the alligator rain
My heart's all pain
For you, for you

Girl you're good
And I've got wild knees
For you
On a mountain range
I'm Dr. Strange
For you, for you

Upon a savage lake
Make no mistake
I love you
I got a powder-keg leg
And my wig's all pooped
For you, for you

With my head in my hands
I'm a hungry man
For you
I got stars in my beard
And I feel real weird
For you

Beneath the bebop moon
I'm howling like a loon
For you
Beneath the Mambo Sun
I've got to be the one
For you, for you
