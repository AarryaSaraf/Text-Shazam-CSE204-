Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready

I take a puff and then I blow it out
And then it starts to decay

And so I'm hoping if I drag this on
I'll cause you some delay

Please don't go
Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

If you go hunting for the grizzly bear
Don't bring a heavy load
You will want nothing that will weigh you down
'Cause then your heart will explode

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go

Please don't go
'Cause I'm not ready
For you to go
