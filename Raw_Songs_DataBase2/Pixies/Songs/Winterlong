I waited for you winterlong

You seemed to be where I belong

It's all illusion anyway


If things should ever turn out wrong

And all the love we have is gone

It won't be easy

On that day


Waiting to follow 

Through the dream light of your way

Is not so easy for me now


After time has passed your way 

Things we thought of yesterday

Come back now

Comeback now

Whoahohhh


Waiting to follow 

Through the dream light of your way

Is not so easy for me now


After time has passed your way 

Things we thought of yesterday

Come back now

Comeback now

Whoahohhh


I waited for you winterlong

You seemed to be where I belong
