Call me devil call me friend but call me Black Jack Hooligan
I came all the way from Aberdeen to live among the go-betweens
Let me tell you tell you about Catfish Kate in the time before when she's just Kate
Here in the mountains all alone before the time we called this home

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and will she get away?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Here in the valley that we all know a river bend that's deep and slow
Where every creature drinks their fill and other creatures take their kill
Now Kate went to catch a fish to put inside her favorite dish
A catfish grabbed her by the head and took her to his house instead

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and will she get away?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Well, they wrestled all the day and night the morning showed the bloody sight
Kate all dressed in catfish clothes his whiskers for her catfish robe whiskers for her robe

Where is my angel fallen down at the river bottom and is she there to stay?
Where is my Blackfoot blossom is she just playing possum who lives another day?

Now she's known as Catfish Kate
