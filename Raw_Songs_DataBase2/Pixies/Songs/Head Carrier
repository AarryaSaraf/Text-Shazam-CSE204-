Head carrier, head carrier

Hey, Rusty come hold Luther's hand
It's deja-vu it's not like I planned
Looks like I'm going where I've already been

I'm going down the drain, again

Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)

Is this really worth it? I got a prison cough
A three-headed monster cut Denny's head right off
You can't be too chill, you can't be too zen

I'm going down the drain, again
I'm going down the drain, again
I'm going down the drain, again

Up the hill to have him killed
And he still hadn't died
He talked awhile and walked six mile
Down to riverside

Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)
Head carrier (head carrier)
