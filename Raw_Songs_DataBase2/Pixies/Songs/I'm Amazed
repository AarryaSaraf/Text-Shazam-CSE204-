- ...girls and fucked 'em at school

All I know is that

There were rumours he was into field hockey players

There were rumours

- So I applied basically

- He was gone the next day

- I went out for the team

- It's like - he was go...  - they'd just like

It was like so hush hush

They were so... quiet about it

And then the next thing you know...


The day before that I was wed

She went upstairs and she cut her hair away


I'm amazed 
I'm amazed 
I'm amazed 



And when I was a little boy

A ball of string my parents took from me


I'm amazed 
I'm amazed 
I'm amazed 



Before I died, I took my Honda

And packed it up, up, up to Arizona (honey)


I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed 
I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed 
I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed 
I'm amazed , I'm amazed, I'm amazed
