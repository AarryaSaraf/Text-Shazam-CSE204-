Once it's gone you'll know
Tides and moons ago
Pagan man, you're miles away

Once a younger moon
Inside this castle new
And you will be miles away

Pagan man, pagan man
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you

Once it's gone you'll know
Inside this castle shows
Pagan man, you're miles away

Once upon a time
Many moons from now
You will be miles away

Pagan man, pagan man
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
