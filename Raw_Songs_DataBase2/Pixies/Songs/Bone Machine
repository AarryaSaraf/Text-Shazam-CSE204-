This is a song for Carol

You're into Japanese fast food
And I drop you off with your Japanese lover
And you go to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
They taste a bit like everyone
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

Your bones got a little machine

You're the bone machine

I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep, yep, yep,

I make you pray you make me hard
Your Irish skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

Your bones got a little machine

You're the bone machine

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh

Your bone's got a little machine
