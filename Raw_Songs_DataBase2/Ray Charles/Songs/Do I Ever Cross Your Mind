Do I ever cross your mind?
Darling, do you ever see
Some situation somewhere, somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time?
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind?

Do I ever cross your mind uninvited?
Or when you're lonely
Or does it only happen to me?
Do you ever wanna know
Do old dreams go endlessly
Or do they just run down somehow and
Gradually become the custody
Of that melancholy jailer for the time
Oh-oh, darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind?

Honey, do you ever wonder what became of all the time?
Tell me now, do I ever, ever cross your mind?
Oh darling, I got to know if I ever, ever cross your mind
