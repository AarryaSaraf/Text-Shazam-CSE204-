So you've got two women in your life
And you love them both
Can't run or put up a fight
You've gotta decide to let one of them go
Find a bottle and a room
Fill it up with solitude
Baby, what you need is just a
Sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (Oh yeah)
Anybody with the blues can tell you
That whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows

So you had a good woman in your life
Well, I'm sorry about that
You didn't know you loved her so and you let her go
And you can't get her back
Ain't nothing your friends can do
No way to rescue you
Baby, what you needs is just a
Sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (Ain't it the truth?)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (Mhm)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows

Don't ever think that, baby, you're the only one
Carrying this world on your shoulders
We all must learn that we just take turns
And sometimes it takes more than one to hold her

So you need a little money and you need a break
And it'll be alright
You got hope, you got faith
But you can never seem to get by
You worked hard and it all fell through
Giving up's too easy to do
It's time that you go find
A sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (I got this feeling)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (I know)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know

Anybody with the blues knows (I believe, I believe, I believe)
Anybody with the blues can tell you
Well, whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know
Anybody with the blues knows (You hear me?)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (I want you to know that)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know
Anybody with the blues knows (Anybody)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (We all know)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows
