What good is the sun
If there was no sky above
Why should the rivers flow
Why should a candle glow

There'll be no peace without all men as one

What could all the leaves
If there no trees to grow
Why should a flower bloom
Soon there may be no moon, oh no, how can you know

There'll be no peace without all men as one

Well, there'll be no songs to sing, there'll be no songs to sing
Oh oh oh, there'll be no bells to ring
And you know, no shout 'til I will play
There'll be no night and day

There'll be no peace without all men as one

Now, if time would stop
Then, why should clocks keep time
Tell me, why should the wind lose chime
And I want to know, why should fires burn, I don't know
But I noticed

There'll be no peace without all men as one
