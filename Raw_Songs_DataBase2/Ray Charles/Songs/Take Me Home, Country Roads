Listen here (Go 'head)

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads

Now wait a minute
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me (Calls me)
The radio reminds me of my home far away (Home sweet home)
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
(Now, hold on, you got it)

All my memories, gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop from my eye

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads
(Ah, I like that) Me, too

(Hey man, you gon' give me some of this thing again?) You know it
(Well, let me hear ya) Right on

Country roads, why don't you take me home to the place I belong
Oh, West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads

(Now put your hands together)
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
Hey, hey, West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads
(Let's do it again, y'all)
Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama, please take me home, country roads
(That's alright, y'all)
