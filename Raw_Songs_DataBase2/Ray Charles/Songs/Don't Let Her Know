Lips make a smile on my face
Eyes, don't let us see you shed a tear
And heart, don't let her hear you skip a beat
And pride, don't let her know how much I care

Please don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I care

Laugh, dance, and sing so she won't notice, yes
The hurt that's still burning deep inside
And don't let her see the way I tremble (The way I tremble)
And don't let her know how much I cry

Please don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I cry (Oh, oh, oh)
