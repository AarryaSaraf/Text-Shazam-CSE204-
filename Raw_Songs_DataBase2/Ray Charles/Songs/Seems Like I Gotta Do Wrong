Another day has come and gone, twenty-four hours
In a world where I don't belong
Another week has passed me by
And it's not because I didn't try

Lord knows, I keep on trying but nobody saw me walking, nobody
And I know nobody heard me talking, I don't know why
I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
Yeah, I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Yeah, mhm

Another job that I can't get
A nice apartment where the landlord just won't rent
And I go to bed, but my sleep won't come, oh, oh, oh
My body's empty and my soul is numb

Sad news, nobody saw me walking, oh no, no, no
Nobody heard me talking
Tell me why I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Little old me, mhm

Yeah, hey, yeah
I'm just a number and not a man
So if I'm crazy, well, heh, who's to blame?

No, not me, when nobody saw me walking, no, no
Nobody heard me talking
I believe I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me

Lord, hear me now
Oh, I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me
Yeah, they must be blind (Ain't it a shame?)
When I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before the people notice me
I hope you don't mind if I say this one more time
Come on and help me, y'all
I gotta do wrong (Yeah), I gotta do wrong (Yeah)
I gotta do wrong (Yeah) before they notice me
Ah, maybe don't see me out there (Keep on singing the song)
I gotta do wrong, I gotta do wrong
I gotta do wrong before they notice me
