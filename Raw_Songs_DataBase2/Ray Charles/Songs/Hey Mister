Oh, listen, everybody, I got an idea
I think we oughta write a letter to the Congress of the United States
And tell 'em what's on our minds
Because we're the richest country in the world
And I just can't understand why we got so many hungry people
You know, I believe we oughta say something like this

Hey mister, you better listen
Well, mister, you better listen
Mama got to wash the rich folk clothes
Just to keep the rent man from throwing us out the doors
Papa look for work with the morning sun
But tell me, how can you find a job when there just ain't none?

Now, hey legislation, if you can fix the nation, huh
Why don't you open up your hearts and listen to this part
Wait a minute
A little child asked for bread with tears in his eyes
Mama said, "We ain't got none," and then they both cried
Don't you hear 'em? I said don't you hear 'em?
Damn it, don't you hear 'em?
Well then, what the hell is wrong with you then? Huh
Listen

The world need love, I know you admit it
What you're doin' to the poor man, huh
Lord knows you oughta quit it
How can he love you? Tell me, how can smile
When back at home, there's a hungry little child

Hey legislation, why don't you try a new route
Listen to the people, and hear what they talkin' 'bout
You see, the poor people know that they can't impeach you, oh no
They just hopin' that their cries will reach you
Now don't you hear 'em? I said don't you hear 'em?
Well then, I feel sorry for you if you don't

'Cause many singers before me have sung this song
Tryin' to remind you to right this wrong
But what I'm wondering, if you ever understand
That rich or poor, a man's still a man

Now, hey legislation, when you start to fix the nation
Take a real good look at the present administration
And then stand up, wave it goodbye
Find someone who can hear the people cry
Lord knows you oughta hear 'em
I ain't lyin', you need to hear 'em, man
You better hear 'em
Somethin' might go wrong, you better hear 'em, oh

Hey mister, what you gon' do?
Hey, the people out here tryna talk to you
You know we need help and we ain't gonna wait
Now, don't talk, get to doin' before it's too late
You see, I understand foreign aid is well and good
But why don't you give some of that money to the neighborhood
Lord have mercy
Oh, can't keep living down here in mud
And I know you're sick and tired of looking at blood
Well, mister, you better listen
Yeah, oh, mister, you better listen
Oh mister, you better listen
Oh mister, you better listen to me
I'm tryna tell you somethin', man
