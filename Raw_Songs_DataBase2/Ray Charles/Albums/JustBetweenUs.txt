// Too Hard To Love You //

Well, I'm going down to the station
Leaving on the midnight train
I ain't coming back here ever again
Baby, did you hear what I'm sayin'

You're making it too hard to love you
You're making it too hard
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, woman
I can't make enough money for you
I can't make enough money for you

Well, I'm working all day like a prisoner
Sweating for the overtime, babe
By the time I get home you're messin' around
Spending all that money away

You're making it too hard to love you, girl
You're making it too hard
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, baby
I can't make enough money for you
I can't make enough money for you

Well, I heard that whistle blow
I have nothing else on my mind
I've got one foot standing up next to the track
The other one waiting behind

You're making it too hard to love you, girl
You're making it too hard, babe
To make enough money for you
I can't keep on buying your love, but girl, no
I can't make enough money for you...

// Stranger In My Own Hometown //

I'm like a stranger
Stranger in my own hometown
I'm like a stranger
Stranger in my own hometown
Some folks I've known since my childhood
Just don't seem to want me around

I came home with good intentions
About five or six years ago, I did
I came home with good intentions
Just about five or six years ago
But my hometown won't accept me
And I just don't feel welcome here no more, no
Play it

Play it

I know

Now look here

I built a house on a hilltop
'Cause, you see, I'm a family man
I work hard in my kind of business
Doing the very best I can
Now, I don't mistreat nobody
And they'll lie if they say I do
And I realize that there are some here that like me
But they're so very, very few
I'm like a stranger
Stranger in my own hometown
My so-called friends stopped being friendly
But they can't keep a good man down, oh no

I'm like a stranger
Stranger in my own hometownâ€”and I don't like it
I'm a stranger
Stranger in my own hometown
'Cause my so-called friends stopped being friendly
But they can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down

// Save The Bones For Henry Jones //

Hey, Lou (Yeah, what's happenin', Ray?)
Look here (Uh-huh)

We're gonna have a supper (Really?)
We'll eat some food that's rare
Ah, at the head of the table (Mhm)
We'll place brother Henry's chair
Invite all the local big dogs (All of 'em?)
We'll laugh and talk and eat (Uh-huh)

And we'll save the bones for Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat

Now, listen, Ray (Talk to me)

I'm going down to the market (Go 'head)
And buy up a lotta fish (Sounds like a good idea)
(Uh-huh, yeah)
That oughta please brother Henry (You think he'll like it?)
Oh, he'll love it, 'cause, uh, fish is his special dish
I'll get a great big can of molasses (Alright)
Just to have a little something sweet (Mhm)

And we'll save the bones for Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat

Now, listen here, Ray (I'm listening)

You know, Henry's not a drinker (No)
Oh no, the boy rarely takes a nip (Are you sure about that?)
You see, he don't even use no napkins (Say what?)
Because the things that he eat, they don't drip (Blip)

One day we had a banquet (Really? Yeah)
It really was a bake
Well, it started out with some short ribs (Mhm)
You know, Ray, and we finished off with some good ol' steak
(Oh, I remember it well)
We thought the chops were mellow (Yeah)
But he said his chops were beat (Uh-huh)

So we served the bones to Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat

Come on, Mr. Jackson, give it to me

Hey, Lou (Yeah, what's happenin', baby?)
Listen to this (Yeah, what's that?)
Henry's just not no drinker (Oh, you jivin'), uh-uh
He rarely takes a nip (He won't even take a sniff?)
Never
He don't need no napkins (Well, well)
Because the things he eats don't drip (Say what?), blip (Mmm)

Our banquet was most proper
Right down to demitasse
Ah, from soup to lox and bagels (Alright)
Know what, Ray? (What's that?)
They even had some pheasant under glass
(Now ain't that class?) I'm tellin' you
But when the feast was all over
Our brother Henry just kept his seat (Really?)

So we served the bones to Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat

(Now you know he's a vegetarian) (Really?)
Henry don't eat no meat
(Can you believe that?)
Henry don't eat no meat
(He's got to be an egg man) (Sho 'nuff)
Henry don't eat no meat
(Give him a bone to suck on)
Henry don't eat no meat
(Alright band, get me outta here)
