// Let The Good Times Roll //

Hey everybody,
Let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done

So let the good times roll,
I said let the good times roll,
I don't care if you're young or old,
You oughtta get together and let the good times roll

Don't sit there mumbling
Talkin' trash
If you want to have a ball,
You got to go out and spend some cash

And let the good times roll now,
I'm talkin' 'bout the good times,
Well it makes no difference whether you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey y'all tell everybody, Ray Charles in town,
I got a dollar and a quarter and I'm just ringing the clock,
But don't let no female, play me cheap,
I got fifty cents more than I'm gonna keep.

So let the good times roll now,
I tell y'all I'm gonna let the good times roll now,
Well it don't make no difference if you're young or old,
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

Hey no matter whether, rainy weather,
If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together,
Oh, get yourself under control, woah, and let the good times roll.

// It Had To Be You //

It had to be you. 
It had to be you.
I've wandered around,
finally found somebody who,
Could make me be true.
Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue.
And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you...

Some others I've seen - might never be mean.
Might never be cross. Or, try to be boss.
But, they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults I love you still.
It had to be you. Wonderful you.
It had to be you...

'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all yo' faults - I love you still now.
And it had to be you. It just had to be you.
It had to be you...

// Alexander's Ragtime Band //

Come on and hear Come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band,
Come on and hear Come on and hear , it's the best band in the land!

They can play a bugle call like you never heard before, 
So natural that you want to go to war
That's just the bestest band in the land, Honey Lamb!

Come on along,
Come on along, let me take you by the hand 
Up to the Man,
Up to the man who's the leader of the band, 
And if you want to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime 
Come on and hear, Come on and hear , Alexander's Ragtime Band!

// When Your Lover Has Gone //

What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

// Deed I Do //

I was oh, so blue till you came along
Just to make my life a wonderful song
You brought sunshine just to brighten my loneliness
Is it any wonder in my happiness
I confess

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hangin' 'round you
Do I love you?
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do

There are lots of others that I have met
Those you meet today, tomorrow forget
You're the only one who ever could stand the test
That's the reason why I choose you from the rest
You're the best

Do I want you
Oh my, do I?
Honey, 'deed I do
Do I need you?
Oh my, do I
Honey, 'deed I do

// Just For A Thrill //

Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain

To me you were my pride and joy
But to you, I was merely a toy
A plaything, that you could toss around at will

Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

Although you're free and havin' your fun
To me you're still the only one
Cause you made my heart stand still
Well, it was just for a thrill

And baby you, you, made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill

// You Won't Let Me Go //

I want you, I need you, I'm all packed up to go
But darlin, if you love me, you wont let me go

If a love's a true love, it never runs smooth you know
So if your love is a true love, you wont let me go

If you dont say you love me, I'm gonna walk right
Out the door
And I'll hope that you'll stop me, so I can hear you
Call me darlin once more

I tell you I love you, yes I love you
With all my heart and soul, so darlin if you love me
You wont let me go

[Solo Piano]

Hey I love you now, I say I love you
Oh with all my heart and soul
So darlin well if you love me
I know you wont let me go
Girl I know you wont let me go

// Tell Me You'll Wait For Me //

I'll always love you the same old way
No matter what may come between
Just send me a smile
Once in a lonely while
Tell me, you'll wait for me

How can I forget you starry eyes
You hair when its lit by the moonlit skies
Just keep that smile in you
Til I come home to you
Tell me, you'll wait for me

You're the one, you're the one
Whom I love, and care so much for
But now, til it ends, I'll just wish to be near
Caressing you dear

I'll always dream of dreams with you
Those things we meant to say and do
Keep them a glow
Someday we'll make them so
And tell me, you'll wait for me

I'll always dream of dreams with you
Those things we meant to say and do
Keep them a glow
Someday we'll make them so
Tell me, you'll wait for me

// Don't Let The Sun Catch You Cryin' //

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more

Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
And baby, you made him so sore

You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
Till the man comes and throws you in jail

Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done your daddy dirty
I tell you, he just don't want you no more

Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Daddy's done turned salty
Baby, you made him so sore

Whoa, you know you done me dirty now
And I just don't want you no more

// Am I Blue //

Am I blue? Am I blue?
Ain't these tears
In my eyes tellin'g you?
Am I blue?  You'll be too,
If each plan with you man
Done fell through.
Was a time I was his only one,
But now I'm the sad
And lonely one,
"Lawdy," Was I gay? 'til today,
Now he's gone and we're through,
Am I blue?

// Come Rain Or Come Shine //

I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be just fine
The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
