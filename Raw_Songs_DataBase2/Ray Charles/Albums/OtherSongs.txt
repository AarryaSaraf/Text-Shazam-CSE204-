// Here We Go Again //

Here we go again
She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time

Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time

I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows that there's no way to win

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time

Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
I'll take her back again
One more time

// You Don't Know Me //

You don't love me
You don't know me

You give your hand to me and then you say, "Hello"
And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so
And anyone can tell, you think you know me well
Well, you don't know me (No, you don't know me)
No, you don't know the one who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips and longs to hold you tight
Oh, I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me (No, you don't know me)

Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too (Love me too)

You give your hand to me and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, to never, never know the one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

Oh, I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too (Love me too)

Oh, you give your hand to me and then you say, "Goodbye"
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, you never, never know the one who loved you so
Well, you don't know me

You don't love me
You don't know me

// Do I Ever Cross Your Mind //

Do I ever cross your mind?
Darling, do you ever see
Some situation somewhere, somehow
Triggers your memory
And do you ever wonder
What became of all the time?
And darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind?

Do I ever cross your mind uninvited?
Or when you're lonely
Or does it only happen to me?
Do you ever wanna know
Do old dreams go endlessly
Or do they just run down somehow and
Gradually become the custody
Of that melancholy jailer for the time
Oh-oh, darling, do I ever, ever cross your mind?

Honey, do you ever wonder what became of all the time?
Tell me now, do I ever, ever cross your mind?
Oh darling, I got to know if I ever, ever cross your mind

// 'Cause We Got Cake (Cakewalk) //

The spirit's always willing when it's fed;
When it's not fed the spirit's dead.
And if the spirit really wants to dance
It needs a little more than bread
To cure the spirit's ache
Give it a little cake!

Come, you all kick up the cakewalk,
'Cause we got cake.
Lady Luck finally learn to bake.
Who said bread? Kick up the cakewalk
'Cause we got pie.

Here and now, not in the by and by.
Say good bye to trouble and famine
It's time to laugh
Laugh, boy, you can examine
The fatted calf.

Come, you all kick up the cakewalk,
'Cause we got cake.
Ev'ryone who is awake, walk
To cakewalk
'Cause we all got cake.

// A Girl I Used To Know //

There's a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say, "Just someone I used to know"

Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
I don't tell them, how many nights I cry without you
I say, "Just someone I used to know"

Just someone I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
But, I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say, "Just someone I used to know"
I say, "Just someone I used to know"

// A Sentimental Blues //

A sentimental blues
Will worry you
And make you do
Things that you
Wouldn't do
Only when you
Hear these blues
A sentimental blues
Will wet your eye
You wonder why
You heave a sigh
You start to cry
Each time that you
Hear these blues
Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool
A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind
{solos}
Sigh, sigh, sigh
And drool
Cry, cry, cry
You fool
Yes, I know that it's cool
A sentimental blues
Deep down inside
Will make you hide
Your foolish pride
A sentimental blues
Will make you lose
Your mind

// A Ship Without A Sail //

I don't know what day it is
Or if it's dark or fair
Somehow, that's just the way it is
And I don't really care
I go to this or that place
I seem alive and well
My head is just a hat place
My breast an empty shell
And I've a faded dream to sell
All alone, all at sea
Why does nobody care for me?
When there's no love to hold my love
Why is my heart so frail?
Like a ship without a sail.
Out on the ocean,
Sailors can use a chart
I'm on the ocean
Guided by just a lonely heart
Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

Still alone, still at sea
Still there's no one to care for me
When there's no hand to hold my hand
Life is a loveless tale
For a ship without a sail

// A Song For You //

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darling can't you please see through me
'cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby
We were alone and I was singin' my song,
Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song
Singin' my song

// A Tree In The Park //

When the noisy town
Lets its windows down,
Little slaves are free at night;
Then we'll soon retreet
]From the busy street,
Till the crowds are out of sight.
There's a rendezvous for lovers,
Where we two can play,
Very near your door,
In the city's core,
But it seems a millions miles away.
Meet me underneath our little tree in the park!
No one else around, but you and me in the dark!
Just five minutes from your door-step,
I'll wait for your step to come along!
And the city's roar becomes a song!
While I'm waiting, I discover more in your charms;
Suddenly I turn around, and your in my arms.
And if there's a moon above you,
I'll carve "I Love You," upon the bark,
Underneath our little tree, inside the park!
We'll make ev'ry bough
Shake, and wonder how
Two could be so nearly one.
Ev'ry blade of grass
Sadly sighs, "Alas!"
Grass can never have such fun.
In the desert town's oasis,
We'll love ' neath the tree;
It can't be a-miss
If the birdies kiss;
We're as good as birds, aren't we?

// Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive //

Gather 'round me, everybody
Gather 'round me, while I preach some
Feel a sermon coming on here
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin'
If you wanna hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark,
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

// Ain't Misbehavin' //

No one to talk with
I'm by my self,
No one to walk with,
But I'm happy on the shelf

Ain't misbehavin' 
I'm savin' my love for you....

I know for certain the one that I love,
I'm through with flirtin' 
Its just you I'm thinkin of
Ain't misbehavin' I'm saving my love for you

I'm like Jack Horner 
Sittin in a corner
Don't go nowhere 
What do I care
Your kisses are worth waitin for

Baby believe me

I don't stay out late I don't care to go,
I'm home about 8 just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin 
I'm savin' my love for you

I'm like jack horner sittin in a corner
I don't go nowhere what do i care
Your kisses are worth waiting for
Baby believe me

I don't stay out late I don't care to go I'm home about 8 
Just me and my radio 

Ain't misbehavin' I'm saving my love for you

// Alone Together //

Alone together, beyond the crowd, 
Above the world, we're not too proud 
To cling together, We're strong 
As long as we're together. 

Alone together, the blinding rain 
The starless night, were not in vain; 
For we're together, and what is there 
To fear together. 

Our love is as deep as the sea, 
Our love is as great as a love can be, 
And we can weather the great unknown, 
If we're alone together.

// And The Angels Sing //

We meet, and the angels sing.
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard.
You speak, and the angels sing.
Or am I breathing music into every word?
Suddenly, the setting is strange.
I can see water and Moonlight beaming.
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore
Suddenly, I see it all change.
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming.
Through it all your face that I adore.
You smile, and the angels sing.
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start.
We kiss, and the angels sing.
And leave their music ringing in my heart!

// Anybody With The Blues Knows //

So you've got two women in your life
And you love them both
Can't run or put up a fight
You've gotta decide to let one of them go
Find a bottle and a room
Fill it up with solitude
Baby, what you need is just a
Sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (Oh yeah)
Anybody with the blues can tell you
That whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows

So you had a good woman in your life
Well, I'm sorry about that
You didn't know you loved her so and you let her go
And you can't get her back
Ain't nothing your friends can do
No way to rescue you
Baby, what you needs is just a
Sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (Ain't it the truth?)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (Mhm)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows

Don't ever think that, baby, you're the only one
Carrying this world on your shoulders
We all must learn that we just take turns
And sometimes it takes more than one to hold her

So you need a little money and you need a break
And it'll be alright
You got hope, you got faith
But you can never seem to get by
You worked hard and it all fell through
Giving up's too easy to do
It's time that you go find
A sad face that you can talk to

Anybody with the blues knows (I got this feeling)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (I know)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know

Anybody with the blues knows (I believe, I believe, I believe)
Anybody with the blues can tell you
Well, whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know
Anybody with the blues knows (You hear me?)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (I want you to know that)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues will know
Anybody with the blues knows (Anybody)
Anybody with the blues can tell you (We all know)
Whiskey and walls don't talk
Anybody with the blues knows

// At The Club //

Well, I just stopped in this evening
To get myself a little taste
The music is nice and swinging
And of course, I really dig the place

Course, I haven't
Had much sleep lately
I feel sorta down and out

Yeah, but look over there
In the corner, man
Oh, yeah, there's something
To shout about

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go nowhere
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender
Girl, I'll be right there

She looked up and blushed and smiled
And my heart skipped a beat
Mmm, she's stacked from
Her head down to her feet

Hey, barkeep
You better come here and get your bread
This little girl's getting ready to split
And I'm about to go out of my head

Hey, hey, pretty baby

Girl, don't you go out that door
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, don't you go out that door
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you
I just might not see you no more

She slowed up just a little bit
And turned her head and smiled
She was 34-24-38
And dressed in the latest style

I finally caught up
With the pretty little thing
Before she got out on the street

And she told she was
Waiting on her old man
Who was a policeman on the beat

Hey, hey, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
(Are you talking to me)

I'm talking to you, pretty baby
Girl, I'll see you another time
If you're a policeman's woman
Just talking to you is a crime

(That's right, bud, let's go)
Oh, no

// Autumn Leaves //

The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold
Since you went away
The days grow long
And soon I'll hear
Old winter's song
But I miss you most of all
My darling
When autumn leaves
Start to fall

// Babes In Arms //

They call us babes in arms
But we are babes in armour.
They laugh at babes in arms
But we'll be laughing far more.
On city street and farms
They'll hear a rising was cry.
Youth will arrive,
Let them know you are alive,
Make it your cry!
They call us babes in arms
They think they must direct us.
But if we're babes in arms
We'll make them all respect us.
Why have we got our arms,
What have we got our sight for?
Play day is done,
We have a place in the sun
We must fight for.
So babes in arms to arms!

// Baby Let Me Hold Your Hand //

Baby let me hold your hand
Until I make you understand
Ohh, baby, baby let me hold your hand
I really believe, everything will sure be grand
Baby I want you by my side
Our love we could never hide
Ohh, baby, baby I want you by my side
Well you know pretty baby, our love we would never hide

[Guitar solo]

Baby I'll buy you a diamond ring
Cadillac and everything
Then baby, I'm gonna buy you a house in style
Then I'll live there forever, yes lord with my little wife and child

// Baby, It's Cold Outside //

I really can't stay - Betty, it's cold outside
I've got to go away - Betty, it's cold out there
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful what you're hurry
And father will be pacing the floor - Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more - Why don't you put some records on while I pour
And the neighbors might think - Betty it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no sir - Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out
Ah but it's cold outside
I simply must go - Betty it's cold outside
The answer is no - I say, it's cold out there
The welcome has been - How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm - Look out that window, man that's hard
My sister will be suspicious - Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more - Oh, never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home - Betty, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand - I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay - Get over that old lie
Ah but it's cold out side

// Bernardine //

Oh, Bernardine (sigh)
Oh, oh, oh, Bernardine
I can tell by the dimple on your chin
You're in beautiful shape for the shape you're in
An' I'm in shape for Bernardine

Oh, Bernardine
Oh, oh, oh, Bernardine
When you wander inta my dreams at night
Your remarkable form is a pure delight
I go, go, go for Bernardine
Bernardine, Bernardine

You're a little bit like ev'ry girl I've ever seen
Oh, your separate parts are not unknown
But the way you assemble them's all your own
All yours and mine, dear Bernardine (yours and mine, dear Bernardine)

Oh, Bernardine
Oh, oh, oh, Bernardine
Say you'll wait for me out by the rocket base
And we'll both blast off into outer space
At oh, oh, oh-oh, Bernardine
Bernardine, Bernardine

Come away with me now in the rocket-propelled machine
We'll come home by the way of a drive-in spa
Just a little this side of Shangri-La
And there I'll stay with Bernardine (there I'll stay with Bernardine)
There I'll stay with Bernardine!

// Bewitched //

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink
I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get, off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - am I
Wise at last, my eyes at last,
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more
Couldn't eat, was dispeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there
Romance, finis.  Your chance, finis.
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis.
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered - no more

// Blue Room //

We'll have a blue room
A new room for two room
Where ev'ry day's a holiday
Because you're married to me.
Not like a ballroom
A small room, A hall room
Where I can smoke my pipe away
With your wee head upon my knee.
We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With Mister and Missus
On little blue chairs.
You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs!

// Blues In The Night (My Mama Done Tol' Me) //

My mama done told me
When I was in knee-pants
My mama done told me, "Son"
She said, "A woman'll sweet talk
And she'll give you the big eye
But when that sweet talking's done
A woman's a two-face
A worrisome thing to leave you to sing the blues
In the night"

Now the rain's a-falling, hear the train a-calling, hoo-ee
Hear that lonesome whistle blowing across the trestle, hoo-ee
Ah-hoo-ee, ah-hoo-ee, old clickety-clack
The echoing back the blues, yeah, in the night, mm-hmm

The evening breeze will start the trees to crying
And the moon will hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
Please, take my word
The mockingbird will sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

Well, from Natchez to Mobile
Oh, from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
Hey, hey, I've been in some big towns
And I've heard me some big talk
But here is one thing I know
A woman's a two-face
She's a worrisome thing that'll leave you to sing the blues
In the night

Ooh-woo-woo, ooh-woo-woo
My mama was right
It just ain't nothing out there but the blues in the night
Well, Mama, well, Mama, you told the truth, you did
You see, I know 'cause
Well, I've been in some big towns, heard me some big talk
Woo-hoo, oh, here is one thing I know
I don't mean no harm but it's the truth, yeah, it is
Listen, a woman'll sweet talk, give you the big eye
Well, oh, ha, but when that sweet talk got done
Look here, I got to tell you
You see, she's a worrisome thing to leave you to sing the blues
Oh-ho, the blues, yeah, in the night
Oh-oh-oh, one more thing
She can make me tremble, she make me tremble something like this
Do it, band
Oh, Mama
Well, Mama, I know what you mean, yeah
I do

// Blues Is My Middle Name //

Dark day people
I know things will come my way
Some day people
I know things will come my way

But as of now it seems
To live it just don't pay

My body is made of heartaches
Blues is my middle name
My heart is made of heartaches
Blues is my middle name

Makes no difference how hard I try
I'm mistreated just the same

Everyone's against me
I don't care where I go
Yes, everyone forgets poor me
I don't care where I go

But I feel that someday, somehow
Hard luck will leave me I know

// Born To Lose //

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

// But On The Other Hand Baby //

[1st Verse]

You know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

You Know I'm hooked for you mama
That's why you sling your weight around

But as long as your lovin' beats your hoggin'
Little Girl I'll never put you down

[2nd Verse]

You argue when I leave for work
You argue when I get home
Everything I try to do for you
You always say that I'm wrong
I bring you home all my money
Except the little I keep for expense
And when I get home to you mama you always tell me
Ray you ain't got nooo sense

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
You I can understand

Ah, But when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make me forget about everything

[3rd Verse]

I think about the lousy way you treat me
Your always-raising sin
I know that you know that I know
That you've got another man
Ah, Half the time that I'm at home
I have to go to a café and eat
And when you argue all night long
I have to go down to the den and sleep

[Chorus]

But on the other hand baby
Your loving eases all my pain

And when you put your loving arms around me honey
You make old Ray forget about everything

// Bye Bye, Love //

[Chorus:]
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry-y
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could di-ie
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

There goes my baby with-a someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

[Chorus]

I'm-a through with romance, I'm a-through with love
I'm through with a'countin' the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My lovin' baby is through with me


[Chorus]

Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Bye bye my love goodby-eye
[Fade:] Bye bye my love goodby-eye
Bye bye my love goodby-eye

// C.C. Rider //

Home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
My home's on the water and I don't like no land at all
So goodbye baby I'm tired of being your dog

// Can't You Do A Friend A Favor? //

You can count your friends
On the fingers of your hand.
If you're lucky, you have two.
I have just two friends,
That is all that I demand.
Only two, just me and you.
And a good friend heeds a friend
When a good friend needs a friend.

Can't you do a friend a favor?
Can't you fall in love with me?
Life alone can lose its flavor,
You could make it sweet, you see!
I'm the dish you ought to savor,
Something warm and something new;
I could do my friend a favor,
I could fall in love with you.

Can't you do a friend a favor?
Let us part the way we meet.
Life with you would have a flavor
Sweet at times, yet bittersweet.
I'm no dish you ought to savor.
Feast your eye on something new.
I will do my friend a favor:
I'll be just a friend to you.

// Chicago (A Great Big Town) //

There's a great big town
On a great big lake
Called Chicago.
When the sun goes down
It is wide awake.
Take your ma and your pa,
Go to Chicago.
Boston is England
N'Orleans is France,
New York is anyone's
For ten cents a dance
But This great big town
On a great big lake
Is America's first
And Americans make
Chicago.
Hi ya boys.

// Christmas Time //

Down through the ages
Round this time of year
People's hearts all a-glow
Yuletide carols fill the air with cheer
While children laugh and play out in the snow
Lights on christmas trees
And snowflakes fallin' down
What a lovely site to see
You will always know when christmas time is near
You feel the need to be in harmony
'Cause christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above

[instrumental interlude]

People goin' here
And people goin' there
Buying gifts for those they
Know and love
Never stop to think
That the greatest gift of all
Is he who sends his love from up above
Waitin' in suspense
To open all my gifts
It seems like the time just creeps along
When we finally see the presents that we have
We open up our hearts and sing this song
That christmas time
Is really more than givin'
It's spreading all the news of peace and love
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
The gift that god has sent from up above
Christmas time
Is really more than givin'
Christmas time
Is all about receiving
Christmas time
Spreading news of peace and love
Christmas time
The gift that god has sent from up above
Christmas time
Is really more than givin'

// Come With Me //

Come with me
Where the food is free
Where the landlord never comes near you
Be a guest in a house of rest
Where the best of fellows can cheer you.
There's your own little room
So cool, not too much light
Where you're one man for whom
No wife waits up at night
When day ends
You have lots of friends
Who will guard you well while you slumber
Safe from battle and strife
Safe from the wind and gale
Come with me to jail
You'll never have to fetch the milk
Or walk the dog at early dawn
There's no -"Get up- you're late for work!"
While you rest in the pearly dawn
You're never bored by politics
You're privileged to miss a row
Of tragedies by Sophocles
And diatribes by Cicero
Your brother's wife will never come
On Sunday noon to bring to you
Her little son who plays the lute,
Her little girl to sing to you
You can commit you little "sin"
And relatives won't yell "Fie!"
You needn't take the annual trip
To the oracle at Delphi
You snore and swear and stretch and yawn
In this, your strictly male house
The only way that sinners go to Heaven
Is in the jailhouse!

// Compared To What //

Oh, well, well, well, well
I love the lie and lie the love
Hangin' on, with push and shove
Possession is the motivation
Messing up the whole damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut
Everybody now
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what?
Oh, lord

Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
Tired old lady kissin' dogs
I hate the human, but I love that stinking mutt
Can't use it now
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what?
Oh, whoa, lord

Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Teachin' what they think is right
Oh, well they all got to be some kind of nut
I don't dig it
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right

Shout it out
Get it
One last message here, y'all listen
Where's the bee and where's the honey?
Where's the God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers, they need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut
He did it now
Tried to make it real, compared to what?

// Crying Time //

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin' Oooh
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder (fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger (stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Yeah now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time

Now you say you've found someone that you love better (better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow ('morrow)
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door

Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'. Alright now
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
(That it won't be long before it's cryin' time)

// Dancing On The Ceiling (He Dances On My Ceiling) //

The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though she's some other place, her face I see
At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my love is there
She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
All through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
But there's my love
Up there above
I whisper, "Go away, my lover
It's not fair"
But I'm so grateful to discover
That she's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

// Day In - Day Out //

Day in - day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out
Day out - day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you
Come rain - come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in - day out

// Days Of Wine And Roses //

[with a jauntier melody than Andy Williams' version]

The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through the meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before
The lone-ly night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

[brief instrumental break]

The days of wine and roses

[more instrumental-rest of the first verse]

The lonely-----the night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

// Dear Old Syracuse //

This is a terrible city.
The people are cattle and swine.
There isn't a girl I'd call pretty
Or a friend that I'd call mine.
And the only decent place on earth
Is the town that gave me birth.

You can keep your Athens,
You can keep your Rome,
I'm a hometown fellow
And I pine for home,
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.
Though I've worn out sandals
And my funds are low,
There's a light that's burning in the patio,
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.
It is no metropolis,
It has no big Acropolis,
And yet there is a quorum
Of cuties in the forum.
Though the boys wear tunics that are out of style
They will always greet me with a friendly smile.
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.

Both the Nile and Danube
Are a silly bore.
I've a hometown river
That assaults my door.
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.
When a man is lonely
It is good to know
There's a red light burning in the patio.
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.
Wives don't want divorces there,
The men are strong as horses there,
And should a man philander,
The goose forgives the gander.
When the search for love becomes a mania,
You can take the night boat to Albania.
I wanna go back, go back
To dear old Syracuse.

// Dearly Beloved //

Tell me that it's true,
Tell me you agree,
I was meant for you,
You were meant for me.
Refrain
Dearly beloved, how clearly I see,
Somewhere in Heaven you were fashioned for me,
Angel eyes knew you,
Angel voices led me to you;
Nothing could save me,
Fate gave me a sign;
I know that I'll be yours come shower or shine;
So I say merely,
Dearly beloved be mine.
Repeat Refrain

// Don't Change On Me //

Girl, you're my sunshine
Chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river
Keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop
Keep it going

[Chorus:]
I love you just the way you are
Honey, don't change on me
Girl, don't you change on me.....girl, don't you change on me....no, no

Girl, you're my lucky star
Honey, don't change on me
Don't change on me.....don't change on me
I used to wonder
Where would I find
Some kind of happiness
And peace of mind
I was living in darkness
But then you came
Bringing the sunlight
Easing my pain

[Chorus]

If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we should meet there
And then forever
We'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
No more stormy weather

[Chorus]

// Don't Let Her Know //

Lips make a smile on my face
Eyes, don't let us see you shed a tear
And heart, don't let her hear you skip a beat
And pride, don't let her know how much I care

Please don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I care

Laugh, dance, and sing so she won't notice, yes
The hurt that's still burning deep inside
And don't let her see the way I tremble (The way I tremble)
And don't let her know how much I cry

Please don't let her know
Don't let her know how much I cry (Oh, oh, oh)

// Don't Set Me Free //

Don't set me free
And leave me all alone
Don't make me be
Just a rolling stone
Lock me up and throw the key away
Make me a prisoner night and day
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free

Don't set me free
On my knees I pray
Have mercy on me
Don't send me away
Like a train jumpin off a track
Without ya baby, I'd blow my stack
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free

Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you
I could love you better, than anyone else can do

So don't set me free
Though I've done you wrong
Baby can't you see
Without you I can't get along
Keep me in a state of agony
Make me miserable as can be
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free

Like a stamp on a letter, if you let me stick with you
I could love you better, than anyone else can do

So don't set me free
Though I've done you wrong
Baby can't you see
Without you I can't get along
Keep me in a state of agony
Make me miserable as can be
And whatever you do to me
Don't set me free
No, no, no, don't set me free
I'm saying no, no don't set me free
Baby, no, no, don't set me free

// Down By The River //

In a sparkling moment,
I loved you, you loved me.
Oh, how sweet fate can he.
In that happy moment
I forgot all my past.
Now I realize the way
The spell was cast,
At last,
Refrain
Once we walked alone
Down by the river,
All the world our own
Down by the river.
Maybe the river made our love song start.
Full was the river, yet more full my heart.
So I love you two,
You and the river,
I'll he there for you,
I and the river
You will remember when you hear my song
Down when the river rolls along

// Dream (When You're Feeling Blue) //

Get in touch with that sundown fellow
As he tiptoes across the sand
He's got a million kinds of stardust
Pick your fav'rite brand, and
Dream, when you're feeling blue
Dream, that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there
So dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

[Instrumental]

Dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true
Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream
Dream
So dream, dream, dream
