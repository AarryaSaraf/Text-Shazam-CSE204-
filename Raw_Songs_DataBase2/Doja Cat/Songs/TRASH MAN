Trash man, trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man

Trash man, trash man
He is the trash man, he fills up the trash can
He picks up the waste, he's got really good taste
He is the trash man, he do what he can
Can't do what he can't, but he's the trash man

Trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride, hey
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride

The banker is the cash man
The photographer's the flash man
The barber is the 'stache man
And the driver is the crash man (Crash man)
The runner is the dash man
And the teacher is the class man
The swimmer is the splash man
But the trash man is the trash man (Haha)
Trash man, trash man, trash man, trash man (Take out the trash)

Trash man, trash man
Trash man, trash man
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride, hey
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride in your garbage truck
I just wanna take a ride
