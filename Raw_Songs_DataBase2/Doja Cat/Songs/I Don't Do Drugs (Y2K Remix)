Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh
All I want is you, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh

Baby, I've been in my bag
You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Shoulda never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (Hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

(And I)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(And I)
Needed a fix of you, not just one kiss from you
I needed more

Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh (My baby, my baby)
All I want is you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh (My baby, my baby)
