Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me
And I be like, "True!"
Do you boo-boo, hah
Nobody gonna stop ya
Talking all that shit who'd want ya
Well your bitch friends ain't real partners
So I dip like a nickname salsa
And your bitch uptight like braids is
Need a fix so I call my barber
Ooh, bitch peep my posture
And I read like I'm on that rasta
Dish it out but you're gonna need armour
Where the fuck is my daughters and my boobies and my markers
My food game is too proper
'Cause your bitch can't afford three lockers
Just get up and get obnoxious
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits, yeah
Doing soo-soos in the whip
New dude, up crew, new hits, yeah
You can't change my flaws, too sharp like a samurai sword
(Shiing!)
Revolutionary adored
Can't bite what the cat harbored
Yeah

Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you
Feeling good, feeling great, feeling great, feeling good how are you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like:
Yeah, uh-huh

Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey

Yeah, yeah, cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey
Cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey (Yeah)
Cool story (Yeah)
Cool story, hey (Yeah)
Cool story but your vibe too off you bore me, hey (Yeah)
Yeah, uh-huh
