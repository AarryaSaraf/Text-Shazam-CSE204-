I got a man but, I want you
I got a man but, I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Making me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you

And you're right
You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Said, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you

I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe, and you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales, but we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Boy, you could take it out of me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to be
I can't tell no one, but they all know

I got a man but, I want you
I got a man but, I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Making me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you

I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate (Oh) 'cause you choose loyalty (Oh, yeah)
And I know your history (Hey), met him before your peak (Hey)

But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me

Just for the night, yeah, just for the night
Do I wanna lose all that I have?
You could be a muse and help me catch
But I just need you to come break my back
