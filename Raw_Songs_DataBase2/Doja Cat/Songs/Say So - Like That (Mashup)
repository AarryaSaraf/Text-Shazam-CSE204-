Let me check my chest, my breath right quick
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties (Titties, titties)

It's been a long time since you, you, quiet
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip, zip, zip (Quiet)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me, with me (Quiet)
You ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Quiet)
You ain't ever even been impressed like this, this, this

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all, day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Do that, do that, baby, all night long (Don't stop) (Hey)
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read (Don't stop) (Hey)
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatles type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
'Cause I like it
I like it
I like it
I like it like that
Said I like it
I like it (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I like it
I like it like that

Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit
(It's been a long time since you, you) (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip)
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit
(All of them-em hating I have you with me, with me)
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit, my shit, my shit
