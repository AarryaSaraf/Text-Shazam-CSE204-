I'm so lonely, baby
Call me baby
I'm so lonely, baby
Um, call me baby
I'm so lonely, baby
Just call me baby, um
(Tell me, baby)
(I'm so lonely)

Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you're right beside me
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me
Baby, baby
Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you're right beside me (Fuck is you're on)
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me (Please)
Baby, baby

Fuck is your ass on?
Nigga, fuck is your backbone?
Back to back, we got back and forth
And you wilin' like you on bath salts
Wish you really would touch me
Remember when you would touch me, baby?
Way to make me feel ugly
Hundred million would fuck me though like
Got me Cardi B'ing, like what was the reason?
Was it your demons? Was it the cheating?
Or was it you reading all through my feed and texts?
Baby, we not playing Simon says
Tell me to shut up, I'll find your bags
I just don't live a lifestyle fit for
The childish shit that you riding with

Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you're right beside me
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me
Baby, baby
Tell me, baby
Why you leave me all alone?
When you talking to me
How you leave me all alone?
When you're right beside me
I feel so alone
Please don't come and find me
Baby, baby

Call me baby
Don't you call me baby
I'm not lonely, baby
I'm not lonely, baby
Call me baby
Don't call me baby
I'm not lonely anymore
