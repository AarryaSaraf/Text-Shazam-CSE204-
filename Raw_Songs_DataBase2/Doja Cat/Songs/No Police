Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
(No police, ha ha, no police)
Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
Whee-ooh (no police) no police

They say I bang, they never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk, walk, but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak, bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease
How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police (no police)

(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
All these bars, no police
(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police

He calls me copper tone, smokin' ultraviolet
We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Uh, that's nasty, but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple Xannies for me quick

Pop a couple Xannies for me
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me quick
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me bitch
Like, huh

(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
All these bars, no police
All these bars, no police
(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police

Yeah, yellow bars, get it in
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitty's hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put ease to your crazy past so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you
Now pop this with me

(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
All these bars, no police

Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police
