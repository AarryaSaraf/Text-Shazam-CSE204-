Yeah, big ole ass (Ass), my jeans ain't got no room (Room, room)
Birkin bags (Yeah), Louboutin shoes (Shoes, shoes)
Lotta bands (Boom), all I see is blue (All I see)
Big ole ass (Mmm), watch that shit go boom (Yeah, watch it)

Bow (Bow), bow (Mm), watch that shit go boom (Watch it)

Yeah, big ole ass, gotta put it down, might sit on the cash
Got a little brown, one lick on the tan
Little drip on the neck, six figure on the hand
I feel like a goat when I sit on the Lam'
When I lift both doors and I hit on the gas
Then zoom, zoom, get out the fast lane
Boom, boom, that's why my ass ate
Bow, bow, love it mi back-weight
Uh, uh, give her the ashtray
She don't want smoke, bitch, whip out the band-aids
Don't get cut, catch a bitch on the bad dates
Ten-hut, left right, left right, shoot
You don't wanna fuck around with my crew
Animal crackers goin' in y'all soup
I mean, Shirley your Temple gon' feel that boom

Yeah, big ole ass (Ass), my jeans ain't got no room (Room, room)
Birkin bags (Yeah), Louboutin shoes (Shoes, shoes)
Lotta bands (Boom), all I see is blue (All I see)
Big ole ass (Mmm), watch that shit go boom (Watch it)

Boom, boom, boom, boom (Yeah)
Bow (Bow), bow, boom, yeah
Boom, boom (Yeah), boom, boom (Yeah)
Bow (Bow), bow (Mm), watch that shit go boom (Watch it)
