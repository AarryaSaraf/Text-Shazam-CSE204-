How I'm suppose to say this? Nigga, I don't really know
I don't give a fuck, these niggas think it's way mo'
Always throwing meanings into things, they out of line
I mean it is art I do my part and that is fine
I don't fuckin' rap to be the best or fuckin' shine
I don't want your Grammy
Why she want her titties signed?
What the fuck you doin' up on WorldStar, watchin' Vines
Nigga go outside, bitches so behind

People fucking with me, I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
I ain't even fuckin' tryin', I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
I ain't even fuckin' tryin'
This whole fuckin' rap sounds like a fuckin' nursery rhyme
This whole fuckin' rap sounds like a fuckin' nursery rhyme
People fucking with me I ain't even fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, I ain't even fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
Even fuckin' trying, fuckin' trying
I ain't even fuckin' trying
I ain't even fuckin' trying
Aghaaa!

Money-money pour up
How about get sober? (shut the fuck up)
How about you treat your momma right and do your homework? (do your homework)
How about you be the one to buy the fuckin' soda?
When you see a movie with your girlfriend makin' mo' bucks
Tell your kids exactly how important education is
Even if you didn't get a fucking education, bitch
Everybody fucking up on something, we ain't perfect
People out projecting and I see it all the time
I can't waste a breath on something feeble, that ain't right
I'm so sick of texting stupid people all the time
It is in my nature: loving people
I don't even needa, I don't even needa

I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try, need to fucking try
I don't need to fucking try
Try, try, try, try, fuckin' try, fuckin' try, fuckin' try

Sweet, yes?
Talkin' 'bout your , talkin' 'bout your-
Salt, bacon, eggs, free-range chicken
Free-range chicken, makin' money
