Laugh
Yeah, rollin', rollin', oh shit
So sick, you know this, oh

Yeah, yeah, I'm high as fuck
Light that dutch
Mark it when I walk in
Yeah, they bite that much
And they stalking my circumference, make your pipes stand up
Like a mic I adjust it, I don't hide that stuff
Niggas in the kitchen with that white, doing bumps
I don't need that in my life I do not like that stuff
(Oh shit, oh shit, yeah, ahaha)
So I pick up where I left off, yes, I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write their own bars
I'mma go far, might be on Mars
Preference is in Pluto, where I sight see all the stars
Out in Highland smoking violet, my, wallet's on a diet
Surfin' cheddy choppin' lettuce in Chebahtah
I'm a goddess, walking through the clouds
Like I am Isis
I'm a dude now, I should try this
'Cause I kind of
Fuckin' nice and
Holy shit, niggas in the back, with a

Nigga
