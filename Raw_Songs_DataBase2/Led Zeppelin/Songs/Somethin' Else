Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
But she don't notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking man, she's something else

Hey, look over there
Across the street
There's a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guess the cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
That cars fine looking man, it something else

Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go riding around
We'll go to the shop a right block down
I'll keep on right on dreaming and thinking to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else

Look a-here
What's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knocking on a door
My cars out front
And it's all mine
Just a 41 ford not a 59
I've got that girl and I'm a thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking man, wow, she's something else
