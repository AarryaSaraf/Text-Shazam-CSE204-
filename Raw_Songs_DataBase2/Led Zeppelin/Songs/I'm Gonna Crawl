Oh she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye

Because she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down

Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

If she would come back, only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every, every little bit of my love

Hit me!

I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People, I just don't care how far

I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl, now
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand again, babe

I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Ah, woo hoo
I don't wanna go, baby

Hey, she give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

Yes I love her
I guess I love her
Yes I love her
I wanna crawl
