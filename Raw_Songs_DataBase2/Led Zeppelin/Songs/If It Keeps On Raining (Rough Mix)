If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
When the levee breaks, have no place to stay

I worked on the levee, mama both night and day
I worked on the levee, mama both night and day
Had to work so hard, keep this water away
Oh Lord, oh no. Oh Lord, oh no.

Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
Mean old levee, taught me to weep and moan
Got what it takes, I gotta leave this home

Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
Crying won't help you, mama praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, baby you've got to move, you got to move now

Keep on crying, keep on trucking along
Keep on grinding, keep on trucking along
I've been digging by the leaves, I'm sure they're coming home, oh well now

Going home, going home
Going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
Going home, going home, going home
