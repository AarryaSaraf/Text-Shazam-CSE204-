Sometimes I think girl
I love you too much now
All I do is sit home
And think about us now

I used to have lots of women
But where did they go now
Somebody tell me
'Cause I don't know

I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)

Why do I let you
Mess with my mind baby
Why do I let you
Take up all my time baby

I can't get weak
I gotta be strong
I should be letting you go
But I keep holding on

I must be losing my touch
All right
(You're losing your touch)
Hey hey
(You're losing your touch)
This couldn't be me
(You're losing your touch)
I'm too cool for that
(You're losing your touch)

This couldn't be me
My game is too strong for that
I used to have all girls from blocks around
I used to have all this action in this town

Ah but look at me now
(You're losing your touch)
I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
Or either I love you too much baby
(You're losing your touch)
Losing my touch
