Fire, in my music
Feel the power coming on
Thunder is a feeling
Getting stronger on this song

Tell me when you feel it
Keep on pushing with the feeling
Well alright, that's what I feel, yeah

You'd better be ready
'Cause we're rockin' with the fire
You'd better be ready
We're on fire

Said, we're rockin' with the feeling
Taking spirits coming on
Said, we're rockin'
Rockin' the city
Getting stronger, movin' on

Tell me when you feel it
Keep on pushing with the feeling
Well alright, that's what I feel, yeah

You'd better be ready
'Cause we're rockin' with the fire
You'd better be ready
We're on fire

Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire

Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire

Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
Fire
Rockin' with fire
