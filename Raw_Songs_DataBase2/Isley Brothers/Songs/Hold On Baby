Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, he's tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now

When he tries
Please don't let him
My advice will be
Better forget him

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, my little honey
(Hold on, baby)

Don't you know he's only tryin'
(Hold on, baby)
To take your love from me now?

I don't blame him, baby
You're so fine
If he thinks he's gonna get you
He's out of his mind

Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)
Hold on, now
(Hold on, baby)

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby

Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
Hold on, baby
