Oh, I'm in bad shape since you've been gone
I lay in bed and cry the whole day long
I can find my mind beginning to crack
I gotta find a way to get you back
I don't want a loneliness to be my destiny
Baby, save me from this misery
Can't sleep, full of thoughts in my head
Feel like I got rocks in my bed

Oh, your lipstick stains on my shirt
Add more pain to my hurt
In a place where deeply, there's no doubt
'Cause it reminds me of a kiss I have to live without

Girl, you gotta have pity on me
Honey, save me from this misery
Oh, I need you so bad
Baby, my heart is 'bout to drive me mad
Oh girl, you gotta (Save me from this misery)
Oh, I need somebody right now (Save me from this misery)

Oh, I'm tired of cryin', tossin' and turnin'
These salty tears keep my eyes burning
Believe me woman, I'm in pitiful shape
Can't take no more hurt, or my heart will surely break
Your love, woman, is the only remedy
Baby, save me from this misery
Oh, I'm hurt so inside me
I need your love, I ain't got no pride

(I'm in misery) Gotta find a way to stop these tears
(Only you can save me girl) Feel like I've been crying for a thousand years
(I'm in misery) Girl I'm so lost without you
(Only you can save me girl) I need you, I need you, I need you, yes I do
