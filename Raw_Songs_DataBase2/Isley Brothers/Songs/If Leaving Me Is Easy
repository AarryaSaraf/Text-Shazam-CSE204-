If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

I read all your letters
I read each word that you've sent to me though it's past now
And your words start to fade
All the memories I have still remain

I've kept all the pictures
I hide my feelings so no one knows, no one
Oh, sure, my friends all come round
But I'm in a crowd, I'm on my own
'Cause you're gone though your heart, heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

You see I'd heard the rumors
I knew before you let me know, you let me know
But I didn't believe it
You would not let me go
Seems I was wrong and I love you, love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away

So just remember
(I love you)
(Remember I love you)

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
