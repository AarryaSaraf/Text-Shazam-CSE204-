All alone for so long
All the hope I had in finding love was almost gone
Then an angel came along
Oh I believe good things come to those who wait
And destiny, girl I know it must be fate
Now I see, cuz I found my soulmate
You're all I need

Oh so wonderful, beautiful
But the words don't do you justice, girl
You're so much more
And I dedicate my life to love you so
Love you so, oh

Oh, I believe good things come to those who wait
And destiny, oh it must be fate
Cuz now I see, babe
Cuz I found my soulmate
You're all I need

Oh let me say it
I wanna say it again girl

Oh, I believe that good things come to those who wait
And destiny, girl I know it must be fate
Cuz now I see, cuz I found my soulmate
You're all I need

Never, never, never, never, never
Never leave me, babe
Stay right there, right there, right there
Oh, so hard to describe babe
You bring tears to my eyes
You're all I need
