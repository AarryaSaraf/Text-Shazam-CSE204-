Ooh, once more, my love
You say you're sorry you caused me pain
But this time is the last time
You'll never break my heart again

'Cause it's one too many times
This poor heart of mine has tried
One too many tears
These tired old eyes of mine has cried
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again
I'm sorry

Time and time again
I tried to believe it could be true
Heartache after heartache
I stood the pain just to be with you

But it's one too many chances
You only used and pushed aside
One too many lonely, lonely night
I sacrificed my pride
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck
I can't stand it
I can't take it, no
One, one, one, one, one
Too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again
