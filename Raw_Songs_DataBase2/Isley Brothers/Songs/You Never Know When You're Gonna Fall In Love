I had it all worked out
I thought I knew just what I want
But, girl, as it turned out
I guess I really didn't know at all

I've been playin' life by the ear
Now the words of love I hear
Is so very clear

Whenever you are near
It's like a spell that's taken over me
What's happenin', my dear?
It wasn't in my plans to fall in love

But, girl, what can I do?
You see, I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love, baby

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, it just seems to happen

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall in love
Love

Since you came around
There's been a certain change in me
And in your love I felt
I slowly found myself turnin' around

How could I let myself go?
I guess you'll never really know
Ah, ah, you never, never, never, ever, ever know

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, boy, it just seems to happen

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall

Love has no sense of time
Love has no sense of time

Ooh, hoo, you never know when
You're gonna fall in love
