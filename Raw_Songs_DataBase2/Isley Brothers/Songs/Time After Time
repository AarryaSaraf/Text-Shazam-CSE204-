Ooh, time
Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you, you run to see
In the evening or when
The day is through

And I
I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so, so new

And time
Time after time
You're gonna hear me
I'm gonna say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
