I got to get myself together
Oh get it together
I got to get myself together
You must get it together

'Cause if I don't do it soon
Old age is gonna catch me now

I gotta get myself together
Stop staying out late at night now yeah
I got to get myself together
Deep down in your heart you know that ain't right

'Cause if I don't do it soon
Old age is gonna catch me now

I gotta get myself together
Why don't you get it together?
Lord lord
Please hear his plea
Find him a good woman
Send her straight home to me

I gotta get myself together
Get it together get it together
I gotta get myself together
I believe you know how to get it together

'Cause if I don't do it soon
Old age is gonna catch me now

Get it together
I gotta get myself together
Get it together
I gotta get myself together
Old age is gonna catch you
I gotta get myself together
Get it together
I gotta get myself together
