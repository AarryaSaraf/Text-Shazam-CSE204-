Sittin' by the windows all alone
Tryin' to understand just what went wrong
The girl I love has gone away
But the reason why she left, she didn't say

Perhaps she just got tired of makin' plans
And promises of things we never had
Well, I done my best, yet things got kind of worse
But for me, my best was good enough
Good enough

I tried to keep an open mind
That she would come to realize, in time
But as I go from day to day
I tell myself that there's no other way

Perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best he could
I wish the girl all the very, very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough

Oh, my best, my best, baby

Oh, perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best, the best he could
I wish the girl all the very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough

My best, my best was good enough

But for me my best was good enough

I know, I know my best was good
Oh, my best was good enough
I wanna wish this girl
All the best of luck, I do
Oh, but for me, my best was good enough
Yes, it was

Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know my best is good enough, yeah
I wish you, baby
I wish you, baby
All the best of luck
Ah, yes, I do
