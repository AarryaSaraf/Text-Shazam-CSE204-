Here I lay, so close to you
Knowing that you'll see me through
Another night when we'll feel the joy
The joy that makes me smile more and more

And every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
And every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Naahh ooooh, oh babe

It seems that time moves much too fast
Love is here and love will last
Your body's warm and sure to please
Lady of love, take all of me

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Noohhh ooooh 

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Aaaah ooooh aaaah

And through the night, the touch of love will be
Forever strong and forever sweet 
And giving in to passion's flow 
Creates a world we want to grow

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine 
Every day-hey-hey 
Ooaoh every night
Every day-hey-hey 
Whoaoh every, every night
Every day-hey-hey
Nahaooh every, every night
Every day I dream, oh I dream
Naohohh each and every night
You're moving me, soothing me, girl
Loving, touching, feeling, ooaaohh 
And I'm feeling good
Ohh feels good
