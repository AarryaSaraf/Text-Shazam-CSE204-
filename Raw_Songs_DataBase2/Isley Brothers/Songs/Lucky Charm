I dream of you 
and me on a ron-de-vou
Somewhere far away 
on a trip for two
we'll take a ride a 
convertible on a straight highway
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine


Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

I'll pour some drinks
then we'll play some CD's
I'll take your hand 
and pull you 
Up close to me
Now tell me can you hear the voice of love calling you and me 
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine


Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

I'll run your bath 
girl, You just make yourself at home
Don't have a care 
in the world cause we're all alone
Just slip off that robe 
and follow the love making sign
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine


Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

Just like a cereal
Chocolate covered cherrio
Girl, Thats every bit of you
Cherries and Lemon lime
Sweet to the last drop
Girl your magicly delicious
You are my ...


Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are
