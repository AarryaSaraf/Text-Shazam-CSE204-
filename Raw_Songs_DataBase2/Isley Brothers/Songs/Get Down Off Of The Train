Get down off of the train
My little girl, don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Let me talk to you today
And try to make you stay
Make you stay
Don't you know
I love you so
And I'll never, never, never let you go

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Get down off of that train, ooh, ooh

Bring little Junior with you too
Oh, don't make him pay for what I did to you
Please don't rob me of my son
I'll make up up for all the wrong I done
I need, I need the both of you
And I promise from now on, I'll be true

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Get down off of the train, ooh, ooh

Take that suitcase out your hand (Get down, get down)
Oh, why don't you glance down and your wedding band? (Get down, get down)
Just think what it means to you
Honey, you know it means the same thing to me too
I know I hurt you deep inside
But I never, never, never wanted to make you cry

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Baby, get down off the train, ooh, ooh

Get down! Get off, get off, baby
Get down! Get off, get down, baby
Get down! Hoo, get down, baby
Get down! Get off, get off, baby
Hoo-hoo-hoo
