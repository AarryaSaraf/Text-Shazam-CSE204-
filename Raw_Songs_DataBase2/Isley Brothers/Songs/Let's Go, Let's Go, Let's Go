There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go
There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go

There's a house party way 'cross town
People coming from miles around
Put on your pretty red dress, girl
Let's go and see about this mess
That's it (That's it)
Baby, let's get, girl (Let's get)
And go way up on the hill
We're gonna have a whole lotta fun
We're gonna greet the rising sun
All night long, we gonna ball, girl
Until we hear your mother call
But that's it (That's it)
Baby, let's get, yeah (Let's get)
And go way up on the hill

There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go
There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go (Ow)

Gee, yeah, everybody's gonna be there now
My friends and yours from everywhere
Whole wide town is gonna be there
Come on, baby, let's go and see
That's it (That's it)
Baby, let's get (Let's get)
And go way up on the hill

There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go
There's a thrill up on a hill
Let's go, let's go, let's go
