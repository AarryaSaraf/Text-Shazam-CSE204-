On lover's eve
I came to you
On hands and knees to beg
For all the things you meant to me
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by

On lover's eve I laid with you
You wanted to be free
I felt your words so painfully
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by

As time goes on I think of you
We just were not to be you always say the need in you
On lover's eve I cried
As lover's day went by
On lover's eve I cried
As lover's day went by
On lover's eve ooh lover's eve
As a lover's day went by
Ooh lover's eve lover's day hey goodbye
Goodbye lover's eve
Da da lover's eve
Mm mm lover's eve
