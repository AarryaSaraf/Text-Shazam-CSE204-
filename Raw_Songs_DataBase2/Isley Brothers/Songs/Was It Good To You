How did it feel to be out there on your own
I want to know
How did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home

I want to know
Well, how did it feel
Was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was it worth all the heartache that it brought me

How did it feel
When he held you in his arms
I want to know
How did it feel
Well, well, well

Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)

Tell me face to face
Is somebody taking my place
Stepping in my shoes
I don't want to lose

Tell me how did it feel to be out there on your own
I want to know
How did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home

I want to know
How did it feel
Honey, was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was it worth all the heartache that you brought me
How did it feel when he took you in his arms
I want to know
Honey how did it feel

Was it good (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
I want to know (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Don't be ashamed to tell me (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
I won't blame you baby (was it good to you baby)
If it was good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
