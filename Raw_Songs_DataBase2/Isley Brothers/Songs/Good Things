Oh, seems this world's got you down
You're feeling bad vibrations frown, now
But open your eyes, girl, look at me
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

And when your world don't just seem right, now
And your life's gettin' you uptight (You uptight)
You can change that wrong for right (wrong to right)
'Cause I was there myself last night (there last night)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
I, I, I won't have nobody now
(No one around) To bring you down
Well, it's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing, girl

Gotta hear me, you can't beat 'em all, if you try (If you try)
They don't care if you live or die (Live or die)
'Cause they're losers, what a shame (What a shame)
I'm gonna show you to a brand new game (Brand new game)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

I won't tell you no, no lies
When I'm through, you will realize (Realise)
For the first time, it seems right (It seems right)
I'm gonna stay right here tonight (Here tonight)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a, oh, good thing, baby
No no, no, nobody, no one around, to bring you down
It's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing

(Good thing, baby) Good thing
(Good thing, baby) I don't know what to do here
(Good thing, baby) Hey, good thing
(Good thing, baby) You know I wanna love it
(Good thing, baby) Come on baby, sit down here with me
(Good thing, baby) Get all over me baby, oh baby I love you
(Good thing, baby) Sit down here with me
