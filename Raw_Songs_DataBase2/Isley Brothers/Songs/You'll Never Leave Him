You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You'll never leave him, you need him too much
(No, no, no, no, oh)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch (Yeah)

You promised me you'd tell him
How our love got its start
But I know your reputation, girl
You're afraid to break his heart
You're still kissing him, honey
And you know, you know, you know that just ain't right
How can you love me all day long
And cry with him all night, yeah, yeah

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You'll never leave him, he needs you too much
(You'll never leave him, never leave him)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(You've grown accustomed, yeah)
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch

You said you'd tell him Friday
All you wanted was more time
But now here it is Sunday, baby
And I'm going out of my mind
You tell me you love me
And I think that I believe it's true
But if I waited for you all my life
Tell me what good would it do, oh oh

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(You'll never leave him, never, never)
You'll never leave him, you need him too much
(Ooh, you'll never leave)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(Yeah, you've grown accustomed)
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(You'll never leave him)
You'll never leave him, you need him too much
(Oh, oh, you'll never leave him)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch, yeah
(I can't believe, believe, believe, believe, believe, believe you'll never, never, oh, oh)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
