I got to find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl who believes in me
And wants to marry me
Oh, I got to find, find me one

Boys, I got to find, find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl to sit and hold my hand
And tell me that I am her only man
Oh yes, I got to find, find me one

One little girl that I can trust
Ooh, one little girl that tells me
She loves me so very much
One little girl, one little girl that tells me
That she needs me
And wanna love me, and wanna love me tenderly

Yes, I got to find, find me one
Yes, I got to find, find me one
Oh, one girl who believes in me
And wants to marry me
Oh yes, I got to find, find me one

Oh, I got to find, find me just one
Oh, don't you know, I got to find me just one
