I get the sweetest feelin' girl
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
I'm livin' in another world
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Oh, when you're close to me now
It's hard to say what I'm feelin'
Oh, on the inside, baby
Oh, I wanna get to know you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby

Visions of me and you
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
How can I keep my cool
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Ooh, you know that I believe you
All I want is your love
Oh, in the meantime, baby
You know I'll never leave you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby

Right now is the time, oh
You're gonna need my love, baby
Oh, so let me in your life, baby
Let me in, ooh, hey baby

I get the sweetest feelin' girl
When I look into your eyes, hey baby
I'm livin' in another world
When I look into your eyes, hey baby, baby

Oh, when you're close to me now
It's hard to say what I'm feelin'
Oh, on the inside, baby
I wanna get to know you
'Cause I know that you're so good, baby

Right now is the time, oh
You're gonna need my love
Oh so let me in your life, baby
And let me in

Let me in your life
Let me in your life
Let me in your life
