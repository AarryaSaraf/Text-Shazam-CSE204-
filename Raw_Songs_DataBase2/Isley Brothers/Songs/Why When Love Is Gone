Ooh
Your love made a slave of me
But the love you gave you took away from me
Foolishly, I believed in you
What a fool I was, thinking your love was true

Selfishly, you broke my heart (My heart)
You were only fooling from the start (You were only fooling)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although you're gone and I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

Your love was  when it started
Darling, why'd you leave me broken hearted?
Why'd you swear to always care
Then you walk away and leave me in despair?

Heartlessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

Ooh
Selflessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Why does my heart keep holding on
Oh, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Oh why my heart...
