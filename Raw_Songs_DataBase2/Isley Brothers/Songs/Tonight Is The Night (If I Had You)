Tonight is the night baby
You know for the first time in my life
I think I found what I want

Tonight is the night, I wanna be with you
You're the kind of woman, I wanna hold on to
Come a little closer, let me show you how much I care
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

Oh, life would be so sweet if I had you
Don't you know that life would be so sweet if I had you

Let me show you a love you never felt before
I'm gonna give you all that I have, and then some more
Come on baby I know you want me to
Kiss me this way and that way and this way baby
Til I'm all over you

Life could be so sweet if I had you
Life could be so sweet if I had you

Oh, tonight is the night
(You know girl, I thought I seen it all)
But you're something special, very special

And I've been all over the world, trying to find someone like you
But for the first time in my life, I realize it wasn't so easy to do
But now that I found your love, I want let you get away no
Cause you're the sunshine that brightens up my day

Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you

(Tonight is the night) 
I wanna be with you
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
You got the kind of loving, I wanna hold on to
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
Come a little closer and let me show you how much I care
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

Oh Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you
If I had you girl, I'd know that
Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you
