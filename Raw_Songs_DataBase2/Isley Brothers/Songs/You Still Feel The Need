Tell me where is your lady, lady where is your man
Playin' mind games on each other, givin' heartaches when you can
Keep your feelin's under cover, feelin' lonely when you smile
One couldn't live without the other, tryin' to prove to the world
That you'll change your style

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need

Tell me where are the people who appeared your best of friends
Seems they add to your confusion 'cause they leave you in the end
Write a letter to your lover and she's writin' one to you
Neither one of you are gonna send it, cause your pride gets the best of you

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need

Tell me when will you deliver your satisfaction's long overdue
Try to hide your true feelin's and it's takin' its toll on you
Find that somethin' that you're missin', take a long look at yourself
If you find somethin' missin', reach on out for something else

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need
