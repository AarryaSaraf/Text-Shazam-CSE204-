Album: HarvestForTheWorld

// Harvest For The World (Prelude) //

Gather everyman, gather everywoman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
When will there be a harvest for all the people
When will there be a harvest for the world

// Harvest For The World //

All babies together, everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied, half of us in need
Love's bountiful in us, tarnished by our greed
When will there be a harvest for the world

A nation planted, so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go, greater grows the pain
And far too many feelin' the strain
When will there be a harvest for the world

Gather everyman, gather every woman
Celebrate your lives, give thanks for your children
Gather everyone, gather all together
Overlooking none, hopin' life gets better for the world

Dress me up for battle, when all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price, come home with the least
Nation after nation, turning into beast
When will there be a harvest for the world

// People Of Today //

Dancin' on the sands of time
Up and down your mind you climb
Frustration is the way you feel
And wondering if it's all for real

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Spinnin' round and feelin' free
Livin' in a fantasy
Are you seein' all there is to see
Are you able to relate to me

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Break down that horizon line
Discovering your piece of mind
The children plant a brand new seed
To touch the things we fail to reach

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Talkin' about the people of today
Talkin' about the people games people play

// Who Loves You Better //

Some say you're too easy
'Cause you stay by my side
I'm the one who keeps you happy
And you keep me satisfied
Just be my lady
That will be enough for me
And it won't matter baby
What your friends think they see

Who loves you better than I do
Who knows you better than I do

Every day that passes by
Every night I spend with you
Puzzled by the things you try
Saddened by the things you do
He can say sweet things to you
And promise you security
I find strength in loving you
Don't fight my love give in to me

Who loves you better than I do
Who knows you better than I do

You know you can't live your life
Doin' what the others do
Always takin' their advice
May not be the best for you
Just be my lady
And that will be enough for me
And it won't matter baby
What your friends think they see

Who loves you better than I do
Who knows you better than I do

// (At Your Best) You Are Love //

Let me know, let me know
Ah - ha, let me know, let me know
Let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn what you think you know

There are times when I find
You wanna  keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength; I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began

But if you feel, girl, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say,
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

Tell me what it is (Tell me what it is)
There's no need to make believe
(Make believe, no need to make believe)
Look beyond your world (Look beyond your world)
Try and find a place for me (Try and find, find a place for me)

Cause at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
And if you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know

// Let Me Down Easy //

Is love behind me?
Though I need you to satisfy me
Destiny will prove to divide me
For you're a part of me
I feel the love within you
Your beauty lies deep within you
Touching me when you feel the need to
Become as one with me

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Take you for granted?
That could never, never be
An advantage
All this love, and free from demanding
You have always felt the need to be pleased
And you stay close beside me
Though our minds are free for deciding
The life to lead and desiring
To see what they can see

Oooh!
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
Ooohhh...

Ah! Spending time, time with you
Counting the days of my life
Oh, hoping that, that with me
You will stay

So let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy
For all I know is you

Being around you
Lovely things I feel are about you
Being strong until I'm without you
For you're the strength in me
And you give me inspiration
Realizing that it has taken
More love and more love makin'
To fulfill my every need

So for me
Let me down easy
If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down easy

If ever you were to leave
My love, let me down
Oh, easy

If ever you were to leave
My lo-ove, let me down, let me down, let me down
Easy, baby

Oh-ho! Let me down, hey, down, down, down, down
Easy
Hey, if ever, if ever, ever, ever you were to leave me

// So You Wanna Stay Down //

So you wanna stay down you refuse to be happy, yeah
You wanna go back on your word 'cause it just got turned around
Oh keep on dreamin' hey baby
Nevertheless you can still be safe and sound

You wanna stay down you refuse to be happy
Oh, you wanna go back to yourfriends on the other side
But keep on dreamin' hey baby

Just remember that I love you
And I wouldn't have it any other way
Get a little stronger in your spirit
And all of your fears will go away

So you wanna stay down you refuse to be happy, yeah
To them you look roped and tied but you're still runnin' fast and free
Oh keep on dreamin' hey baby
Your motivation in somethin' hard to see

You wanna stay down you refuse to be happy
Well, whatever happens to you I know that you're one of a kind
Just keep on dreamin' hey baby

Sometimes you find disappointment, but never forget what you truly believe
People see you crawlin' but you're gettin' closer
Now ask yourself can you get off your knees

// You Still Feel The Need //

Tell me where is your lady, lady where is your man
Playin' mind games on each other, givin' heartaches when you can
Keep your feelin's under cover, feelin' lonely when you smile
One couldn't live without the other, tryin' to prove to the world
That you'll change your style

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need

Tell me where are the people who appeared your best of friends
Seems they add to your confusion 'cause they leave you in the end
Write a letter to your lover and she's writin' one to you
Neither one of you are gonna send it, cause your pride gets the best of you

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need

Tell me when will you deliver your satisfaction's long overdue
Try to hide your true feelin's and it's takin' its toll on you
Find that somethin' that you're missin', take a long look at yourself
If you find somethin' missin', reach on out for something else

Everything you did together made you feel happy
Same things done alone don't feel the same
In a hurry to forget but you still remember
Every time you do, you feel a pain - You still feel the need
