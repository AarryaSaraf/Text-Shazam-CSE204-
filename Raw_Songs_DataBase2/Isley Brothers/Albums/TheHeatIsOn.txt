// Fight The Power (Part 1 & 2) //

Time is truly wastin', there's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah,
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

I tried to play my music, they say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, hey

Time is truly wastin', there's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
I don't understand it, people wanna say yeah


Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, let's just have some fun naw, naw
Seekin' my satisfaction, keeps me on the run

I tried to play my music, say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
By all this bullshit going down, oooh

Time is truly wastin', there's no guarantee, yeah
Smile is in the makin', we got to fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah, woo, hey, even you and I can fight the power
Fight it, fight the power

// The Heat Is On (Part 1 & 2) //

Give me the price to pay
To stay in this game you play
Although your game is strong
Move on, the heat is on
Ha-ha the heat is on, yeah the heat is on
Hey you better keep movin' on, hey-hey the heat is on

Undercover you hide away
Layin' back to make your play
The bigger the thrill, the better the song
Move on the heat is on, Ah the heat is on
Hey you better keep movin' on, the heat is on
Can you feel it-yeah, yeah

The charge of love is on the way
Make it easy, make me stay
In case you can't hang on
Move on, the heat is on
Well the heat is on, I can feel the heat is on
That's why I keep movin' on, I know the heat is on

Lightnin' strikesâ€”thunder breaks
And in a flash, you're on your way
And if you're tryin' to lead me on
Move on the heat is on...the heat is on
Hey the heat is on, you better keep movin' on
Said the heat is on

I can feel that the heat, the heat is on,
I'm movin', y'all see me movin' on

Yeah! I can feel that the heat is on,
Everybody feel it...

// Hope You Feel Better Love (Part 1 & 2) //

Who is to say you'll be livin' in sadness
Hope you feel better Jove
Now's not the time to give in to the madness
Hope you feel better love, better love

Thought you were sharin' and found you were takin'
Hope you find better love
Try it on me and there'll be no forsaken
Gotta find better love, better love

Hope you feel better love girl, hope you find better love
Hope you feel better love girl, better than before

Runnin' away you gave in to deceivin'
Hope you find better love
When you find out it was for the wrong reason
Hope you find better love, better love

I hope you feel better love, find it baby, I hope you find it, I hope you feel
Better love, find it, find it baby, find better love

// For The Love Of You (Part 1 & 2) //

Yeah
Well, well, well
Yeah...hey...
Yeah
Hey...hey...
Ooh

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candlelight
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, ooh

Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you, alright now, ooh

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the mornin' comes
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me, well

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be, well
When you're lovin' me, when you're lovin' me, ooh

Love to be
Ridin' the waves of your love, enchanted with your touch
And it seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, alright now
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you, you got me, girl

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you, alright now
All that I'm givin', givin'
Is for the love of you, oh, yes, I am

Paradise I have within
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key, well
And this I see, for I see

Now and then I lose my way
Usin' words that try to say
What I feel, yeah
Love is real, oh, love is real, ooh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

I know that I'm livin'
For the love of you, oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm livin'
For the love, love of you

Every, every day I'm livin'
For love of you
I'm livin' for the love
Each and every day

I'm, oh, whoa, I'm, oh, yes, I am
I wanna say it one more time
Said I'm livin'
For the love

Each and every day I'm, oh, whoa, I'm
Lord knows I am
Write that down
Said that I'm livin'
For the love, love of you
Ooh, ooh

// Sensuality (Part 1 & 2) //

Here I lay, so close to you
Knowing that you'll see me through
Another night when we'll feel the joy
The joy that makes me smile more and more

And every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
And every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Naahh ooooh, oh babe

It seems that time moves much too fast
Love is here and love will last
Your body's warm and sure to please
Lady of love, take all of me

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Noohhh ooooh 

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Aaaah ooooh aaaah

And through the night, the touch of love will be
Forever strong and forever sweet 
And giving in to passion's flow 
Creates a world we want to grow

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine 
Every day-hey-hey 
Ooaoh every night
Every day-hey-hey 
Whoaoh every, every night
Every day-hey-hey
Nahaooh every, every night
Every day I dream, oh I dream
Naohohh each and every night
You're moving me, soothing me, girl
Loving, touching, feeling, ooaaohh 
And I'm feeling good
Ohh feels good

// Make Me Say It Again Girl (Part 1 & 2) //

Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
You're the promise everlasting
And where you are I hope to be

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

Whatever pain's inside, you make it better
You seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes
Givin' my life directions if I am turned

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

How am I worthy of love from an angel
Princess imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hopin' that what I've revealed you already know

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need
