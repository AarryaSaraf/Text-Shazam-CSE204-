// Was It Good To You? //

How did it feel to be out there on your own
I want to know
How did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home

I want to know
Well, how did it feel
Was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was it worth all the heartache that it brought me

How did it feel
When he held you in his arms
I want to know
How did it feel
Well, well, well

Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)

Tell me face to face
Is somebody taking my place
Stepping in my shoes
I don't want to lose

Tell me how did it feel to be out there on your own
I want to know
How did it feel
Just for a bit of excitement
Girl you strayed away from home

I want to know
How did it feel
Honey, was it worth all the pain that you caused me
Was it worth all the heartache that you brought me
How did it feel when he took you in his arms
I want to know
Honey how did it feel

Was it good (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
I want to know (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)
Don't be ashamed to tell me (was it good to you baby)
Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)

Was it good to you (was it good to you baby)

// Black Berries //

You know my brothers and I was raised in Cincinnati
Cincinnati Ohio
And I remember when we were kids we used to walk to the woods
And go black berry picking
Swinging our baskets on our arms
Skipping down the road, you know
And Kelly used to have an expression, you used to say back then
We made a song out of that expression
I remember the words of it
It used to go a little like this

The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
He said these words
The blacker the berry he said the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry sweeter the juice

You know he digged black berries so much
And everywhere he would go he would use that as his excuse you know
Staying out late at night
And my brother Rudolph he used to like strawberries, if I remember correctly, at the time
And at the time my thing was wild cherries
I remember the three of us used to steal tomatoes
And lay on the ground and peel all kind of ice potatoes [?]

Saying
The blacker the berry
The sweeter the juice
Alright
Lord have mercy

Yeah, yeah
We used to strip down bananas
And throw the peelings away at the same time in the street, you know
And when it got hot we just drank all the lemonade we could get
Til we knocked ourselves clean off our feet
And we walked along
Singing the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
Come on y'all
Black berry
The sweeter the juice
Help me sing this song
Black berries
The sweeter, the sweet the juice
Now how would you look eating a green berry, you know
What's the use
Swing you basket on your arm
Sing it sing it sing this song
The blacker the berry
The blacker the berry
Yeah yeah
The sweeter the juice
I like black berries
And everywhere I go, that's my excuse
I can still hear them singing the song
If you listen hard enough you'll hear
The sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry
Blacker the berry

I like black berries
That's my excuse

Black black black
Sweeter the juice
Sing it one more time
Little baby
The sweeter the juice

I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse

Sing, sing sing the song
Blacker the berry
Sweeter the juice
Blacker the berries
Sweeter the juice

I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse

We would wander along
Sing sing sing the song

I like black berries
I like black berries
That's my excuse

// Get Down Off Of The Train //

Get down off of the train
My little girl, don't leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Let me talk to you today
And try to make you stay
Make you stay
Don't you know
I love you so
And I'll never, never, never let you go

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Get down off of that train, ooh, ooh

Bring little Junior with you too
Oh, don't make him pay for what I did to you
Please don't rob me of my son
I'll make up up for all the wrong I done
I need, I need the both of you
And I promise from now on, I'll be true

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Get down off of the train, ooh, ooh

Take that suitcase out your hand (Get down, get down)
Oh, why don't you glance down and your wedding band? (Get down, get down)
Just think what it means to you
Honey, you know it means the same thing to me too
I know I hurt you deep inside
But I never, never, never wanted to make you cry

Ha! Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you)
Girl, you know I need you (You know I need you)
I can't live without you
Baby, get down off the train, ooh, ooh

Get down! Get off, get off, baby

Get down! Hoo, get down, baby
Get down! Get off, get off, baby
Hoo-hoo-hoo
