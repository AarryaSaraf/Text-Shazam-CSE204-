Album: LiveItUp

// Live It Up, Pt. 1 & 2 //

You never want to comfort me
Knowing what you really need
You always say youve had enough
You never want to give it up

But everybodys got to move and
Everybodys got to groove
Everybody needs love sure enough
Everybody ought to live it up
Well what did I do that was wrong
I just want to have some fun
Weve been holding back for too 
And I want to live, weve gotta live it up
Ive got to ease your mind
I know Ill have a bit of luck
To make you have a good time
I've got to make you live it up

// Brown Eyed Girl //

Wished I could sing you
Sing you the song I sang once
Brown eyed girl, if you could deal with it, baby
I would girl, sing it all night
You want a lover
You need not look no further than my shadow
Time passes slowly here without you, baby
Nothing's new
Here in the darkness all is still
Needing you near me, if you will
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Know I just don't have
Just don't have the (Incomprehensible)
Wish that I
Well, well, sometimes I wish that I
Wished I could tell you, tell you the thoughts
Tell you the thoughts that I'm thinking
Brown eyed girl, if I could deal with it
Baby, I would tell it all now
Been writing you letter that unfolds
Telling you secrets of my soul
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl

// Need A Little Taste Of Love //

Hey Mister, walkin' with the blues
Hey Mister, payin' heavy dues
Havin' troubles, and it ain't so hard to find
When you're ridin' double, and you're running out of time

No need to feel, that you lack the spirit
Within the body, but it's in the soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love

Hey Mister, tell me how long has it been
Hey sister, so how could you pretend
Why keep the sorrow, where it don't belong
Well come tomorrow, oh help me sing the song

No need to feel, that you lack the spirit
Within the body, but it's in the soul
If you wanna be loved, then let somebody hear it
Might as well face the facts, no need to be holdin' back
Need a little taste of love

Need a little taste of love

// Lover's Eve //

On lover's eve
I came to you
On hands and knees to beg
For all the things you meant to me
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by

On lover's eve I laid with you
You wanted to be free
I felt your words so painfully
On lover's eve I cried as lover's day went by

As time goes on I think of you
We just were not to be you always say the need in you
On lover's eve I cried
As lover's day went by
On lover's eve I cried
As lover's day went by
On lover's eve ooh lover's eve
As a lover's day went by
Ooh lover's eve lover's day hey goodbye
Goodbye lover's eve
Da da lover's eve
Mm mm lover's eve

// Midnight Sky, Pt. 1 & 2 //

Midnight Sky the moon is a quarter 
Layin' low and south of the border 
I know that when I awaken 
I've taken more than moon beams home in a jar 
Oh baby, mornin' and there you are right next to me 
Can you feel it

Break of day and I'm feelin' hazy 
And she's feelin' good 
Milky Way is all in my mind 
I have no sense of direction when 
loving you 
I lose conception of time 
Under the midnight sky baby get next to me 
Can you feel it

The greatest pleasure too great no measure 
After the day is done 
An invitation to find temptation 
Under the midnight sun

Under a midnight sky, baby...get next to me

// Hello It's Me //

Hello, it's me,
I've thought about us for a long, long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
Something's here that doesn't last too long.
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine.
Seeing you,seeing anyone as much as I do you,
I take for granted that you're always there,
I take for granted that you just don't care.
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through,baby.

It's important to me
That you know you are free
Cause I never want to make you change for me, babe (don't change, don't change)
No, I wouldn't change you, change you for the world (don't change, don't change)
No, don't change, girl (don't change, don't change)
Stay as sweet as you are (don't change, don't change)
But one thing I want you to do is,

Think of me, think of me, yeah
You know I'd be with you if I could,
Come around and see you once in a while,
If you ever need a reason to smile,
I'd spend the night if you think I should.

It's important to me
That you know you are free
Cause I never want to make you change for me

And I'll come around and see you once in a while,
If you ever need a reason to smile,
I'd spend the night if you think I should.

Just don't change, girl (don't change, don't change)

// Ain't I Been Good To You, Pt. 1 & 2 //

You made a fool out of someone
(Out of someone)
You thought love was true
And found out that you were just having fun
(Just having fun)

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And I recall the time
You needed somebody and I made you mine
You needed a friend
So I took you in and treated you so kind

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After after all, I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And you know I've always been around
And I never, never, never let you down
And now you're telling me that you must go
You know that you're hurting me so

But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you gonna wake up and find
You'll come back to me on your bending knee
And you're gonna be crying

And oh, believe me, what I say it true, baby
After all, Lord I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Everyday and every way
(I've been good to you)

You know, you know, you know, baby
I've been so good
(I've been good to you)

You made a fool out of someone
(Out of someone)
