// Sensitive Lover //

La da da da da la da da
Oh yeah
La da da da da la da da
Oh, yeah yeah
Oh

I been waiting for you girl
So much on my mind I wanna to do
(Like) lay you down
(And like) mess around
(Like) all night long
Girl, let's get it on

My secret lover
My mystery girl
I wanna play hide and seek
Baby, let's creep between the sheets tonight

My secret lover
My mystery girl
I wanna play hide and seek
Baby, let's creep between the sheets tonight

My door is open wide, let me come inside
Shadows fill the room from the candlelights
See our bodies moving to the groove, yeah
So girl let's get it on, ain't no time to loose

You got me on cloud nine
And I don't wanna come down
Your lovin' soothes my soul
And I love it when you come around

This meal is on my plate
I can't wait to taste, taste you girl
Good lovin' going down all around this place
(Like) upstairs
(And like) down there
(Like) everywhere
Woman, I don't care

If the wind blows, no one knows
'Bout the hiding place on my porch
You body's cold, let me step to you
And rub you down nice and slow
Nothing but the water
And opportunity for you and me
So baby girl just ride my wave
Until the next day
Can't you feel me babe, oh baby

My secret lover
My secret lover

// Brazilian Wedding Song (Setembro) //

Today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true

I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

Oh Lord, oh Lord, here I stand
Golden chains around our hearts
Vow to death we'll never part
From this day as one we'll start our lives

Oh Lord, here I stand
With my heart out in my hand
Rich or poor, I am your man
I'm your lover and friend for life
Ooh

So much love, so much love, girl
So much love, girl, la, la, la, la
Today, today, today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true

I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

And I can hear them when they play
Our Brazilian wedding song
