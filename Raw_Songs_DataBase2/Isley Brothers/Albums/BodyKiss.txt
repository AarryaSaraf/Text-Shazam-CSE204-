// Lucky Charm //

I dream of you 
and me on a ron-de-vou
Somewhere far away 
on a trip for two
we'll take a ride a 
convertible on a straight highway
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus:]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

I'll pour some drinks
then we'll play some CD's
I'll take your hand 
and pull you 
Up close to me
Now tell me can you hear the voice of love calling you and me 
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus:]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

I'll run your bath 
girl, You just make yourself at home
Don't have a care 
in the world cause we're all alone
Just slip off that robe 
and follow the love making sign
Girl nows the time to lay you down and make you mine

[Chorus:]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is
what you are 
Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane
love it when you call my name 
Lucky Charm is what you are

Just like a cereal
Chocolate covered cherrio

Cherries and Lemon lime
Sweet to the last drop
Girl your magicly delicious
You are my ...

[Chorus (till fade):]
Candy Star, Silver Moon, Cherry Rain, Summer June, Chocolate me, Caramel you, My lucky charm is

Caramel, Candycane, Sweeter than Sugarcane

Lucky Charm is what you are

// What Would You Do? //

Hello, ladies (Hello)
How are y'all doin' tonight (Fine)
Can I keep it real (Yes)
And say what's on my mind (Yes)

There you are in that chair
Waiting for me to take you there
To break it down and sing to you
And make you feel these words are true

Who's gonna be the lucky one
Who spend some money on 'em and have some fun
Tell me, I choose you

(What would you do) What would you do if I said all of
these words were true
(What would you) What would you do if I came down here
and sat with you
(What would you do) What would you do if I told the
band to break it down
(Ooh) What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down

(What) What would you do if I put this money in your
hand
(Would you do) What would you do if I said I'd like to
be your man
(What would you do, baby) What would you do if I
brought you up here on this stage
What would you do if (Tell me), what would you do

The lights are down (Yeah), the mood is set (Yeah)
The sound is right, I'm heated
Look to my left and check my crowd
Look to my right (Yeah) to see if they are ready now

Tell me who out there feels lucky
Wants me to take 'em shopping and buy 'em everything
Hmm, I choose you

(Now what would you do, yeah) What would you do if I
said all of these words were true
(What would you do) What would you do if I came down
here and sat with you
(What, what) What would you do if I told the band to
break it down
(Break it down) What would you do if I said I wanna
lay you down

(Ow) What would you do if I put this money in your
hand
(Out this money on your hand, baby) What would you do
if I said I'd like to be your man
(Be your man) What would you do if I brought you up
here on this stage
(Right up here) What would you do if, what would you
do (What if I got your)

Hair done (Yeah), nails done (Yes, I will)
Toes done (And) bank account (I'll even take you)
Shoppin' (Girl, I will) if you be good (You'll have)
Your own car (And the) platinum credit cards

(What would you do, baby) What would you do if I said
all of these words were true
(What would you do) What would you do if I came down
here and sat with you
What would you do if I told the band to break it down
What would you do if I said I wanna lay you down

What would you do if I put this money in your hand
What would you do if I said I'd like to be your man
What would you do if I brought you up here on this
stage
What would you do if, what would you do
