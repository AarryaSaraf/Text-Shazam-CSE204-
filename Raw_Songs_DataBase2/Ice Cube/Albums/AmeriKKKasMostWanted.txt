// The Nigga Ya Love To Hate //

I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga

That's why I'm sick of gettin treated like a goddamn stepchild

Fuck a punk cause I ain't him

You gotta deal with the nine-double-M

The damn scum that you all hate

Just think if niggas decide to retaliate

They try to keep me from running up

I never tell you to get down it's all about coming up

So what they do go and ban the AK?

My shit wasn't registered any fucking way

So you better duck away run and hide out

When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out

Cause I'm about to fuck up the program

Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham

When I'm shooting let's see who drop

The police the media and suckers that went pop

And motherfuckers that say they too black

Put em overseas they be begging to come back

They say keep em on gangs and drugs

Yyou wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug

Kicking shit called street knowledge

Why more niggas in the pen than in college?

Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate

That's from the nigga ya love to hate

[BREAK]

<Fuck you Ice Cube>

Yeah, ha-ha, it's the nigga you love to hate

<Fuck you Ice Cube>

Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me

It's the nigga you love to hate

<Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops

Yo, you ain't doing nothing pops for the brothers

What you got to say for yourself?>

You do like how I'm living?  Well, fuck you


Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho

Ice Cube the bitch killa cap peeler

Yo runnin through the line like Bo

It's no pot to piss in

I put my fist in

Now who do ya love to hate

Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball

Cause I don't fake you're begging I fall off

The crossover might as well cut them balls off

And get your ass ready for the lynching

The mob is droppin common sense and

We'll gank in the pen will shank

Any Tom Dick and Hank or get the ass 

Fake it ain't about how right or wrong you live

But how long you live

I ain't with the bullshit

I meet cold bitches no hoes

Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz

And tell the young people what they gotta know

Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low

And if you're locked up I dedicate my style in

From San Quentin to Rykers Island

We got em afraid of the funky shit

I like to clown so pump up the sound

In the jeep make the old ladies say

Oh my god wait it's the nigga ya love to hate

[BREAK]

<Fuck you Ice Cube>

Yeah come on fool

It's the nigga you love to hate

<Fuck you Ice Cube>

Yeah run up punk

It's the nigga you love to hate

<Yo, who the fuck you think you are calling girls bitches?

You ain't all that

That's all I hear, bitch, bitch

I ain't nobody's bitch>

A bitch is a.... 


Soul Train done lost they soul

Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes

I see a lotta others damn

It almost look like the Bandstand

You ask me did I like Arsenio

About as much as the bicentennial

I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of

the Ice Cube

And what I say what I portray and all that

And ain't even seen the gat

I don't wanna see no dancing

I'm sick of that shit listen to the hit

Cause yo if I look and see another brother

On the video tryin to out-dance each other

I'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle

And don't give me that shit about role model

It ain't wise to chastise and preach

Just open the eyes of each

Cause laws are made to be broken up

What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up

And build mold and fold theyself into shape

Of the nigga ya love to hate

// AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted //

Ice Cube with The Lench Mob, I got it goin on
A nigga that's livin in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
cos everybody's goin crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
or beat down for ya flag
Cos if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
Cos you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin did my hair grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
for the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob

(AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted)

Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
to bust a cap cos it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I reap all your fat shit, jack
Back to the criminals sect
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet
Cos I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
and sweat em like sweathogs
and get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted

Aiyo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
put another jack in progress
It's the American way
cos I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube - a motherfuckin clepto
and tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
you know I'ma beat the wack
with a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
so get the Kryptonite cos I'm a rip tonight
Cos I'm scarin ya, wanted by America

(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck has heard?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank for the caucasian
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewellry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin in a dig, yo it couldn't be
(Whattup G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when
the ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a colour is most wanted

// What They Hittin' Foe? //

Fucking around in a crap game
Niggas think I'm soft cause now I'm in the rap game
And I don't hang out as much
Bang out dope cuts
Standing on stage and I'm grabbing my nuts
But when it comes to getting in a circle
I'm hitting sevens turning broke niggas purple
Looking for Little Joe and the dumb nigga scream and choke
When deuce-deuce hit the floor yo
Now which of ya wanna fade the twenty?
I'm turnin your fat pockets skinny
Ah yeah I'm shaking the ivory
And boom it's like they die for me
Fool you can get loud, get mad, hit the joint
But don't forget my point
There it is yo
I put my Nike on the bet so it won't slide
Money gone cause I'm never hitting deuce-five
I'm never hitting four-trey no way
You wanna leave but come on hoe stay
Nigga see but that'll work
Poppa needs brand-new shoes and a sweatshirt
Fool you can't even fuck with that
And now that I'm winning I gots to get my gat
Cause I see your homies starting to look
And broke motherfuckers they make the best crooks
And I'm feeling like a baller
Bucking fools now the circles getting smaller
Now you wanna go and scheme
Punk niggas like you just love to triple-team
So I pick up my money and start walking
Cause now I let the gat start talking
Now since ya'll lost you wanna go out like a sucker
Take that motherfucker

// You Can't Fade Me //

Now the taste of alcohol is filling up my bladder

What's the date and time it don't matter

Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was trying to sort

To make a long story short

Ran into this girl named Carla

Knew her from the back seat of my homie's Impala

She said what's up yeah what's the deal

Check the hairdo of course it ain't real

Then I looked down she was fat in the front

I asked how long, well about seven months

Oh how time flies when you're having fun

She said yeah but the damage is done

Where you been, on a little vacation

Oh by the way congratulations

Who's the lucky man? I don't have a clue

Then she said the lucky man is you

I dropped my brew

And everything looked fuzzy

Not a baby by you the neighborhood hussy

She said yeah remember that date

I thought back and tried to calculate

Then I said damn are you sure it's mine

Cause I know you been tossed plenty of times

She said that day no I wasn't whoring

Your ass is mine that's when the sweat started pouring

Cause all I saw was Ice Cube in court

Paying a gang on child support

Then I thought deep about giving up the money

What I need to do is kick the bitch in the tummy

Naw cause then I'd really get faded

That's murder one cause it was premeditated

So what I'm a do

I don't have a clue

How many months left damn only two

I'm gettin faded


No cigar, G

Ay yo homey man I'm getting faded


It's crazy cause before I could sleep with her

I had to duck and dodge and try to creep with her

See the booty and the front was all in place

But the girl had the pitbull face

So we ran jumped drove swam crawled hid

Oh lord god forbid

My homies see me at the motel

Cause those fools would love to just go tell

Everybody in the hood that knows your rep

So jump in the back seat and quiet is kept

And hold your big fat butt steady

Cause yo hoe I got the paper bag ready

She started moaning and gobbling like a turkey

I knocked the boots from here to Albuquerque

I dropped her off man and I'm knowing

That I'm a hate myself in the morning

I got drunk to help me forget

Yo another day another hit shit

I'm gettin faded


Ay yo you know what time it is


Nine months later she's ready to drop the load

And everybody in the hood already knows

It's supposed to be mine so they laughing at me

You know Ice Cube can't be having that G

I'm thinking to myself why did I bang her

Now I'm in the closet looking for the hanger

JD and Jinx and T-Bone won't let up they won't shut up

I'm gettin fed up bitch

Cause I know you're tryin to break me

But if I find out your tryin to fake me

I'm a buff that duff for a hoot

Beat ya down and leave a crown or two

That night she went into labor

And the shit is getting kinda major

The baby came out damn it was a lifesaver

Looking like my next-door neighbor

She said it was mine that was her best guess

But let's check the results of the blood test

I started smiling yeah cause it read negative

Damn why did I let her live?

After that I should've got the gat

And bust and rushed and illed and peeled the cap

But no I just told the hoe who laid me

Excuse me bitch it's a switch

You can't fade me


Naw baby not this way

Yo you ain't playing Ice Cube out like no booger

I don't fall for the okey-doke

And before I fall for the okey-doke

I let the pistol smoke

Now sing it

Yeah baby you can't fade me

Naw unfadable baby

// Once Upon A Time In The Projects //

Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I damn near had to wreck a ho
I knocked on the door - "Who is it?"
It's Ice Cube, come to pay a little visit to ya
And what's up with the niggas in the parking lot
She said "Fuck em, cause they get sparked alot"
I sat on the couch but it wasn't stable
And then I put my Nikes on the coffee table
Her brother came in, he's into gangbangin
Cause he walked up and said "What set you claimin?"
I don't bang I write the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminded me of Good Times
I don't like to feel that I'm put in a rut
By a young nigga that needs to pull his pants up
He threw up a set and then he was gone
I'm thinkin to myself, won't this bitch bring her ass on
Her mother came in with a joint in her mouth
And fired up the sess, it was sess no doubt
She said please excuse my house and all that
I said yeah cause I was buzzed from the contact
Lookin at a fucked up black and white
Her mom's bitchin cause the county check wasn't right
She had another brother that was three years old
And had a bad case of the runny nose
He asked me who I was then I had to pause
It smelled like he took a shit in his little drawers
I saw her sister who really needs her ass kicked
Only thirteen and already pregnant
I grabbed my forty out the bag and took a swig
Cause I was getting overwhelmed by BeBe Kids
They was runnin' and yellin' and playin' and cussin'
And tellin' and look at this young punk bailin'
I heard a knock on the door without the password
And her mom's got the 12 guage Mossberg
The nigga said "yo, what's for sale"
And the bitch came out with a bag of yayo
She made the drop and got the 20 dollars
From a smoked-out fool with ring around the collar
The girl I was waiting for came out
I said "Bitch, I didn't know this was a crack house"
I got my coat and suddenly ...
(police breaking into house annoucing themselves)
The cop busted in and had a Mac-10 pointed at my dome
And I said to myself once again it's on
He threw me on the carpet and wasn't cuttin no slack
Jumped on my head and put his knee in my back
First he tried to slap me up, wrap me up, rough me up
They couldn't do it so they cuffed me up
I said FUCK how much abuse can a nigga take
Hey yo officer you're making a big mistake
Since I had on a shirt that said I was dope
He thought I was selling base and couldn't hear my case
He said "Get out my face" and musta had a grudge
His reply, "Tell that bullshit to the judge"
The girl I was with wasn't sayin nothin'
I said "Aiyyo bitch you better tell em somethin'"
She started draggin and all of a sudden
We all got tossed in the paddy wagon
Now I beat the rap but that ain't the point
I had a warrant so I spent 2 weeks in the joint
Now the story you heard has one little object:
Don't fuck with a bitch from the projects

// Turn Off The Radio //

Turn on the radio take a listen
What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and DJ's ignored me
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the C
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
DJ face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as 
Crazy as they come see 
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine

<Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Play the music motherfucker put the music on
Damn!>

Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That R&B love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio

<You know what?  You know what?
Basically those black guys and those rap guys
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
I hate those fuckers
I hate em
Especially that one guy
The AmeriKKKa's most wanted
Ice Cube--I hate that fucker
Get him off the air,  get him off, get him off
Get that rap shit out of here!>
<Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!>

// Tales From The Darkside //

[Verse One: Ice Cube]


Peace - don't make me laugh!

All I hear is motherfuckers rappin sucotash

Livin large, tellin me to get out the gang

I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger

How the fuck do you figure?

that I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!

Every cop killer goes ignored

They just send another nigga to the morgue

A point scored- they could give a fuck about us

They rather catch us with guns and white powder

If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me

Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy

They kill ten of me to get the job correct

To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck

Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk

And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck

You should listen to me cuz there's more to see

Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities

The other color don't know you can run but not hide

These are tales from the darkside...

[Verse Two:]


You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh

Cuz we ain't got it too good in America

I can't fuck with them overseas

My homeboy died over a key of cocaine

It was plain and simple

The 9mm went <pop> to the temple

<pop pop pop> was the sound I put the bitch down

And ran to the schoolyard bathroom

Looked in the trash can yo it had room

So I ducked my ass in it for a minute

Covered with trash I had to lay back

Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback

Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun

I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun

It's gettin critical - I stole a 5.0

I let it go - drive real slow

I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'

The shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers

I told you last album

when I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off

Its a shame, that niggas die young

But to the light side it don't matter none

It'll be a drive by homicide

But to me its just another tale from the darkside...

[Verse Three: Chuck D]


Standing in the middle of war

In the middle we flex

When we die, we won't make +Jet+

+Ebony+ can't see to the lightside

The term they apply to us is a nigga

Call it what you want, cause I'm comin from the coroner

Sayin my rhymes with a Ph.D.

Who's black - don't wanna role - sells his soul

Watch his head go rollin

Who the fuck are they foolin?

Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes

Matches the color of the one on my face

as they wonder whats under my waist

(Standin on the verge) of them gettin brown

thats a fact got a fear on their bozack

Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide

Yet Cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!

// A Gangsta's Fairytale //

[Intro: Little Russ, Ice Cube]

[story-teller] Once upon a time, in the black part of the city
[young kid]  Yo G, yo G you better get out of here man, 5-0
[door swings shut, car peels out]

[Russ] Yo Ice Cube, man
[Cube] Whassup man?
[Russ] Why you...
[Cube] Whassup?
[Russ] Yo Ice Cube man, why you always kickin the shit about the bitches 
and the niggaz?  Why don't you kick some shit about the kids, man?  The
fuckin kids?!
[Cube] Word

[Verse One: Ice Cube]

Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell ya a story or two
About a punk-ass nigga I knew
Named Jack, he wasn't that nimble, wasn't that quick
Jumped over the candlestick and burnt his dick
Ran up the street cause he was piping hot
Met a bitch named Jill on the bus stop
Dropped a line or two, and he had the hoe
At that type of shit he's a pro
So Jack and Jill ran up the hill to catch a lil nap
Dumb bitch, gave him the claps
Then he had to go see Dr. Bombay
Got a shot in the ass, and he was on his way
To make some money, why not?
Down on Sesame Street, the dope spot
There he saw the lady who lived in a shoe
Sold dope out the front, but in back, marijuana grew
For the man that was really important
Who lived down the street in a Air Jordan
Ride to the fellow Mister Rogers and hoes
Drove a 500 sittin on Lorenzoes
He broke out, Little Bo Peep, smoked out
Saw, her and her friends sellin sheepskins

[Little Bo Peep] 
Yo yo I got them sheepskins
Yo, my empty sheepskins
Yo baby, what's up with that?

Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Riding Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence?  Yo I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

[Interlude: Little Russ]

Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit!
(Well, you know the rest)

[Verse Two: Ice Cube]

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
With a joint, drinkin some 8-ball
Three little pigs in a Coup de Ville
Lookin for, the wolf to kill
They're fucked up and they want revenge
Them and Humpty used to be friends
Now they're enemies cause he's a traitor
Pulled out the Uzi cruised by and sprayed him
Cinderella hoeing for the fellas
And Mister Rogers is gettin mighty jealous
Of the cash that the pigs were makin
Time for the pigs to get turned to bacon
Cause Mister Rogers found out quick
That Humpty Dumpty was blown to bits
They said that the motherfuckin wolf was next
So Mister Rogers better watch his step
So he let the wolf know
We're gonna fuck up the pigs, and take their ho
Cause Cinderella is much too fast
Before twelve, givin up ass
Double barrels all loaded and cocked
As soon as they show, they gonna get popped
They bailed down Sesame Street and caught em
Little Boy Blue is up front givin orders
Little did they know Cinderella was a fink
She called the cops and got thrown in the clink
A bad influence?  Yo, I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the stories should go

[Outro: Little Russ, Ice Cube]

[Cube] Aiyyo man was that dope enough for you?
[Russ] Yeah you aight, you in the house
We outta here, seeeee-yaaaaa
[Cube] Yeah you better go home before I whoop your little bad ass

[Barney Rubble] Some bedtime story huh?
[Bugs Bunny] It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't wanna live here

[Andrew Dice Clay] Ay, good ol' Mother Goose, remember her? I fucked her

// I'm Only Out For One Thang //

[Flavor Flav]
Well two bees in a bucket
Mother motherfuck it
You either Flavor Flav it
Or you Chuck Chuck Chuck it
Kiss my ass or suck a D.I.C.-
K. stands for kill so don't fuck with me
I fucked that lady in the bed
I missed that pussy and I bust a spread
I tried it again in a thumping wagon
The bottom fell out and her ass started dragging
Tried it again and I failed to grasp
I missed that pussy and I bust my ass
Then I fucked this lady in the tree
The baby came out and said "Run-DMC"

[Ice Cube]
I knew this girl who looked just like you
Light brown and a fly hair-do
I wanted to do her, screw her
So I stepped to her
On-key bitch had more ass than a donkey
I said you're the type of girl that I can't pass over
Give me one chance and I'll bend your ass over
Just call me the plumber at the end of the night
Cause a nigga like me'll lay plenty of pipe
She didn't get offended it was splendid to me
Cause mister nice guy is what I pretended to be
I guess I just wine her and dine her
And by the end of the night I'll be behind her
Waxing that ass like Rain Dance
On the bumper get the pussy then I dump her
Took her to the Comfort Inn
Tucked her in
Pulled out the third leg pumped it in
She said will you call me
Yeah I'll call you a bitch or a hoe after I ball ya
Naw I'm just playin but it's still the same
Cause a nigga like Ice Cube is only out for one thang

// Get Off My Dick And Tell Yo Bitch To Come Here //

Some don't think I can flow
So here we go 
To a new track
To show the wack
That I can throw styles that show up
I blow up and blast here
Niggas still tripping off the shit I said last year
About a bitch is bitch is a bitch is a bitch
Then I got rich but I'll never switch
So I dedicate this one to the groupie
And the Charlie all on my Snoopy
Brothers keep asking Ice Cube yo when will you bust
They surround me and make a big fuss
Now I was taught back on my block
That you don't ride on nobody's jock
For anything they do
Fuck him and his crew
Unless you were gettin paid too
I'm not saying this to dis each and every fan
Women you can ride but man be a man
Shake my hand and make it a firm shake
Say what's up Ice Cube and then break
Cause if you're hangin there I'm a tell you loud and clear
Get off my my dick nigga and tell your bitch to come here

// Rollin' Wit The Lench Mob //

You can't fuck with the criminal rapping over gangsta shit
First I load the clip and then I make the hit
I know some y'all can't fade this
Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
So you and your boys are ass-out
When I'm rollin in a seven-deuce glass house
The Mob ain't nothing but a menace
When we get the motherfucking dog in us
Playing them old beats
I'm pouring out some of my beer for my homies
Ready to peel your cap
You can't believe "Faces of Death" on wax
Some say the Mob ain't positive
Man fuck that shit cause I gots to live
How I live and you could either give a fuck punk
Yo or get your ass bucked
Some rappers are heaven-sent
But Self-Destruction don't pay the fucking rent
So you can either sell dope or get your ass a job
I'd rather roll it wit the Lench Mob

To be down with the Mob is simple
Mind your own you want a spot find your own
And take mine if you're badder than the strong man
I do the right thing I do the wrong thing
Do anything cause I ain't faking the scene
It's all about how much bacon you bring
And if you see something from the gat I will stuff it
Yo you ain't seen nothing
Cause if you testify you're living blind
Cause in the city you live and let die
Rolling with the fools One Time can't beat
On my knees in the street interlock my hands and feet
He said "I know you" I said "you might
My name is Ice Cube I did a song you didn't like"
So he soaked me up like Bounty
Had to do a week in the county
A piece of cake it was just like a party
Cause in the county you know everybody
No I didn't kill or steal or rob
Locked up for what cause I'm rollin wit the Lench Mob

If you know a female that's rollin with the Lench Mob
Watch your step cause the gat is kept
In the purse like my homegirl Yo-Yo
You gotta be down and you can't be a hoe no
Cause if you are I'll be the first one to bust you out
After my crew I'll be the first one to rush you out
Get the picture or bitch
You'll get the eighty-six
If she wanna try and mix
Business and pleasure make up your own mind
You gotta be a hoe on your own time
Don't sleep cause even on a solo creep
Yo the Mob is still deep
And we'll play ya just like a nit-wit
You thought you got with the crew you can't get with
So get the noose ready for the lynching
Now 235 is what I'm benching
But nowadays it's still not enough
I got something guaranteed to stop the bum rush
Give me the gat, step back, and watch me do the job
Rolling with the motherfucking Lench Mob

// Who's The Mack? //

Straight gangsta mack 
Straight gangsta mack 
Straight gangsta mack 
Straight gangsta mack 
Who's the mack? is it some brother in a big hat 
Thinking he can get any bitch with a good rap? 
Rolling in a fucked-up Lincoln 
Leaning to the side So it looks like he's sinking 
Into that leopard interior 
This nigga thinks every girl's inferior 
To his tongue, get a dumb bitch sprung 
As she's selling more butt 
Don't even get a cut of the money 
His name is Sonny 
And he know the play 
And hope to od that he don't find a runaway 
That's looking to become a star 
He'll have your ass in and out of every car 
With every on and Rick, sucking every john's dick 
Come short of the money, get your ass kicked 
You don't like it but you still call him hunk 
Last night the nigga put yo' ass in the trunk 
You wanna leave but Sonny started talking fast 
And it make you wanna go and sell more ass 
He's getting rich, you his bitch and it's like that 
Now ask yourself 
Who's the mack? 
Who's the mack? 

It is that fool that wanna pump the gas 
Give you a sad story and you give him cash? 
He starts macking and macking and you sucking 
Quick to say I'm down on my luck 
And you give a dollar or a quarter and he's on his way 
Then you see his sorry ass the next day 
Are you the one getting played like a sucka? 
Or do you say, "Get a job, motherfucker"? 
Every day, the story gets better 
He's wearing dirty pants and a funky-assed sweater 
He claims he wants to get something to eat 
But every day you find yourself getting beat 
He gets your money and you run across the street don't look both ways 
'cause he's in a daze 
And almost get his ass hit for the crack 
Now ask yourself
Who's the mack? 
Who's the Mack? 

Is it that nigga in that club asking 
Have you ever been in a hot tub? 
I know the game so I watch it unfold 
When i see the boy pinned to your earlobe 
He's talking shit and you crack a smile 
When he tell you that he can go buck wild 
For a girl like you and make it feel good 
You know it's drama but it sound real good 
He started dragging and hopefully he can start tagging 
The pussy so he can keep bragging 
He say, "I'm 'a leave baby, can you go with me?" 
The pussy so he can keep bragging 
You wanna do it but you feeling like a H-O-E 
You grab his hand, you leave and it's over 
'Cause the nigga ain't nothing but a rover 
Ya knew the game and you still ended up on your back 
Now ask yourself 
Who's the Mack? 
Macking is the game and everybody's playing 
And as long as you believe what they saying 
Consider the a M.A.C.K. and with no delay 
They are gonna get all the play 
But when it comes to me, save the drama for your momma 
It's Ice Cube and you know that I'm a 
Mack in my own right 
When it comes to rhyme and rap 
'cause all i do is kick facts 
Unlike Iceberg Slimm 
And all of them be claimin' be P.I.M.P. 
No, I'm not going out that way 
I'm just a straight up N I double G A 
Next time U get over on a fool 
And you did the shit like real smooth
Thank Ice Cube for giving up the facts 
And ask yourself 
Who's the Mack? 
Straight gangsta Mack 
Straight gangsta Mack 
Straight gangsta Mack 
Straight gangsta Mack

// It's A Man's World //

[Ice Cube]
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

[Yo-Yo]
First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

[Ice Cube]
Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

[Yo-Yo]
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

[Ice Cube]
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

[Yo-Yo]
Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

[Ice Cube]
Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

[Yo-Yo]
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

[Ice Cube]
This is a man's world thank you very much

[Yo-Yo]
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

[Break]

[Ice Cube]
Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

[Yo-Yo]
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

[Ice Cube]
I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

[Yo-Yo]
But you don't know how funky that I can get

[Ice Cube]
This is a man's world thank you very much

[Yo-Yo]
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

[Break]

[Ice Cube]
Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

[Yo-Yo]
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

[Ice Cube]
Yeah so what's the problem

[Yo-Yo]
Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

[Ice Cube]
Yeah I admit you can flow

[Yo-Yo]
Well that's true

[Ice Cube]
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

[Yo-Yo]
Yeah I can see you got it good

[Ice Cube]
Oh that I know

[Yo-Yo]
But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

[Ice Cube]
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

[Yo-Yo]
So what up then

[Ice Cube]
Girl what you tryin to do

[Yo-Yo]
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

[Ice Cube]
This is a man's world thank you very much

[Yo-Yo]
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

[Ice Cube]
Or a big butt...

// The Bomb //

It's like a holocaust to the boss when I toss
Too much knowledge kicked then you're lost
In a shuffle of feet, Jinx the fiddler
And I control your mind like Hitler
You bow and vow to authority
See now, a sucker with a style just boring me
So I show K.N.O.W.
L.E.D.G.E. it might trouble you
Then I transform like a Decepticon
With a mic as a bomb
In my right palm
But I don't stay calm
So panic
Others can't flow so they go schizophrenic
You thought I dropped a dud in your face
Until you taste the blood of the bass
Then you faint, or better yet pass out
When I'm on the mic, believe it's ass out
You think you're raw so you draw
You lose, you're hung, you bite your tongue
The whole town saw in awe as you strangle
A noose on your neck, and you dangle
From side to side in the blazing heat
You're beat, you're dead, the fools fell off
You feel you're turning red, it's said
That your head burst
And this is only the first verse
Of the bomb

[Break]

Don't break up the fight let them rumble
Over the years I've watched some go super-bad quick
Now the smell of the pen has got them sick to the stomach
Now ask yourself, who's stupid?
I take funky funky beats and I loop it
And pimp slap you in the face with the bass
And the boom from the bomb that I drop
Stop
You have a flat top as a fashion
I love Black women with a passion
But when they gotta go and show their ass in
I gotta clown the hoes, yeah
You gotta watch the ones with the big derrieres
They'll steer you wrong
Ice Cube's got it going on, hit me
For the gangster boogie two times for the gangster rhyme
The system ain't wholesome
They want to put a young brother in Folsom
And others see me on lockdown
But I come up foul then they get knocked out, word
To the brother that rolls the herb
Everybody getting knocked to the curb like that
Jinx got the gat, and it's a fact
He'll kick a funky beat to peel your cap
Now who's the mack?
Who's the hoe?
Who's the trick?
I got many, many styles won't you take a pick
But don't be alarmed
When I trip and stumble and fumble
And drop the (rewind)
Drop the bomb

[Break]

I'm solo, you ask how I'm living
Still dropping more shit than a pigeon
With the L, the E, the N, the C, the H,
The M, the O, the B, the great
Lyrics that make the beat swing and I gotcha
It's the hip-hopper that don't like coppers
And if you try to upset the pot son
You get kicked in the chest like a shotgun
I make the beats, I make the breaks
I make the rhymes that make you shake
Make you find
Ice Cube never caught in the middle
I make shit to kick you in the ass a little
And still never hesitate to stutter step
Or bust a repitition on the mic
Still dissing all the hype
From left to right
How many left to fight?
So what that Lench Mob like?
