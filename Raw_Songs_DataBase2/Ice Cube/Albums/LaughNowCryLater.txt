Definition Of A West Coast G

// Why We Thugs //

[Intro]

Yeah

Every hood's the same [2X]

Come on

[Chorus]

They give us guns and drugs

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

They wanna count the slugs

Then come around here and fuck with us (Uh huh)

They give us guns and drugs

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

They wanna count the slugs

Then come around here and fuck with us

[Verse 1]

I'm from the land of the gang bang

Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed

It's the same ol same

Bush run shit like Sadaam Hussien

I cock and aim, clinically insane

To deal with this bullshit day to day

If I sell some yay or smoke some hay

You bitches wanna throw me up in pelican's bay

Call me an animal up in the system

But who's the animal that built this prison

Who's the animal that invented lower living

The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons

Thank god for Sugarhill

I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill

Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids

How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

It's boyz in the hood, it's toys in the hood

Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood

Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood

Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood (For real)

Cause when niggaz get tribal

It's all about survival, nobody liable

I got caught by five-oh

Grandmama came to court with her Bible

But when the judge hit the gavel

Now I'm too far from my family to travel (Fuck)

I just came unraveled

Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Owned by C.A, State Property

Just like the year fifteen fifty three

Looking for me, a one-way ticket out

Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

(Damn) I can't take the pressure

Pulled the fo-fo up out the dresser

Grabbed the weight up out the closet

Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it

Can't tell you niggaz what the fucking boss did

The game got a nigga exhausted

Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered

Twenty years for what?

Breaking these laws that's so corrupt

Taking these halls and filling 'em up

Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt

Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck

Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

In the hood, don't press your luck

Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

[Chorus]

[Outro]

Every hood's the same [3X]

Every hood's the same [2X]

Stop tripping on it

Every hood's the same [3X]

Every hood's the same [2X]

// Smoke Some Weed //

[Ice Cube]

Ice Cube motherfucker

West coast motherfucker


George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton

Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley

Rick James, knew how to throw a party

"Smoke some weed!"

Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech & Chong

Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong

Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling

"Smoke some weed!"

[Chorus: Ice Cube]

This is West coast nigga thinking

California quicksand got a nigga sinking

I can give a fuck what you niggaz drinking

"Smoke some weed!"

This is West coast nigga thinking

California quicksand got a nigga sinking

I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking

"Smoke some weed!"

[Ice Cube]

If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer

Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers

Understand, that yo' life's in danger

Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers

Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler

Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger

Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers

I'm a nigga, that wanna bone T'Penga

G4, pull it up out the hanger

A lil' something, to fuel you niggaz anger

The swine, I'm your face rearranger

In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger

Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Spranger

I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer

I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya

Police, still get the middle fanger

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Lil' niggaz, don't try this at home

Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone

Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome

Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown

Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne

With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown

Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone

Go back to Africa used to be a theme song

I'm in the zone, do anybody got a zone

I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone

Youse a clone, who don't know the shit you on

Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone

I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron

You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone

Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home

Gorilla niggaz, here come King Kong

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Ice Cube motherfucker

West coast motherfucker

"Smoke some weed!"

You know my shit shine (doin what it 'pose to do)

I make the bitch mind (doin what it 'pose to do)

[Ice Cube]

Had to come through, shine on you niggaz

Stop lyin on a nigga, got my nine on your liver (click  clack)

Fuck around and go blind on a nigga

Do time for a nigga, put your mind on your mirror (POO POW!)

All you niggaz that's materialistic

Don't fuck wit'cha boy or become a statistic

Ice Cube is very artistic

But I'm still from the hood, will take your existence

So muhfuckers tryna scratch my paint

It's West coast in the house, what the fuck you thank? (the fuck you  thank?)

I'm big bank guy, spent on my outfit

'Cause I'm fly and your ass ain't about shit

I let that bullshit do what it 'pose to do

Go to the club, grab me a hoe or two

Understand, God has a chosen few

Fuck around, and I'll put some holes in you

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Now e'ry muhfucker in here bitchin, we rollin

In that big body wide thang, a nigga patrollin

Y'all jealous of the ass that a nigga be holdin

Ain't scared of the po' po' and what they patrollin?

Gotta job muhfucker, I work for myself

I got benefits bitch, dental and health

I do it 24/7, I rob 7-11

If I had to, I take it straight back to heaven

+Witta Attitude+, I got the Range blowed out

So if you jack me homey, I never jump out (No!)

I just tickle these switches and tickle these bitches

That's lickin all on my paint job like liquorish

I know a lotta dances, they call me Jolly Ranchers

'Cause I shine like Rudolph, nigga fuck Prancer!

Ice Cube, reflect like chrome (bling!)

When I'm in the hood, I run it like Rome (Yi-YAY!)

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Call her ass right there, she got that kush

And I'ma run all through it like Reggie Bush

And I'ma hit that bush like George Bush

In the middle of the night like a crook

Don't fuck with her, her ass is average

Only fuck with the ones with the whole package

Who gives a fuck if yo' ass look good

If yo' ass can't cook good, that's on the hood (that's on the  hood)

Fine bitches, you shit out of luck

'Cause I'm prolly gon' eat more than I fuck (more than I fuck)

You got do it all, not just send them all

Cook and cleaning, love a nigga's shitty drawers

Naw, I'll keep you flossin up at Ready Tellers

The kinda shit that make them other bitches jealous

Pull up, jump out, I'm like new money

And watch the bees in the house come and get the honey

[Chorus]

"Ri-ride through the hood"

"Keep it low to the ground" [Cube:] Yeah

"Ride through the hood"

"Keep it low to the ground" [Cube:] Show  out

"Ri-ride through the hood"

"Keep it low to the ground" [Cube:] Show  out

"Low, low to the, l-l-low to the ground" [Cube:] Show out

// Laugh Now, Cry Later //

[Ice Cube]

Uh-huh, understand this

I don't give a fuck about what y'all talkin about

I ain't tryin to hear none of that shit

Nigga I'ma do what I wanna do

When I wanna do it, how I wanna do it

And you better hope I don't do it to you

Now, I don't care what momma got to say

I don't care what grandmomma got to say

Nigga I'm grown

Let me tell you a lil' somethin about me


I was born not to give a fuck, wanna drink, get your cup

Turn it up, throw it up, take the world, blow it up

Somebody slow it up, roll it up, smoke it up

My own momma can't keep me from loc'n up

One ear out the other, one man out to smother

The neighborhood, that left me here without my brother

Fuck you undercovers and you dirty motherfuckers

In the hood, that still fuck without rubbers

Club hop, bar hop, car shop, nail shop

To the mall, spend it all, why the hell not

What bills, what rent, don't know what's spent

Why you care, do you work for the government?

[Chorus]

Fuck it homey, I'ma laugh now and cry later

Get your paper we can laugh now and cry later

All you players you can laugh now and cry later

Investigators let you laugh now and cry later

[Ice Cube]

See I'm a product of this urban decay

A nigga dyin for tomorrow, but live for today

A nigga lie steal and borrow, and cheating's okay

Don't you tell these motherfuckers that my name is O'Shea

Cause I'ma fuck up my baby's credit, let him regret it

7 months old he's already got a jail record

I'm the one to blame, put it in my momma name

She's a drama queen, but I got the bling bling

I need the watch and the bracelet and the earrings

I need you all to show up at my hearings

Tell the judge I'm a nice nigga, good nigga

And I'ma play the sad face when he look nigga

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]

"The number you are calling was lost, and cannot be called back"

"Your last call return service"

[Ice Cube]

It's fucked up, that y'all won't accept my calls

Tell momma, at least she can send some drawers

These walls, make y'all forget about me

I'm comin home, in 2033

But that's irrelevant, did you get the mail I sent

What I tell a bitch, you better stay celibate

She start lyin to me, tell me who she ain't fuckin

Never tell me that my homeboys ain't nothin

Bun in the oven, it belong to my cousin

Got the nerve, to tell me that you really love me

(What?) I'ma kill her ass when a nigga make parole

Hit her with my cane, cause a nigga gray and old

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ice Cube]

Man, it ain't right man

Y'know y'all ain't doin me right man

A nigga tryin to do right man

Y'know I'm tryin to change my life man, y'know?

I done found the Lord while I'm in here, y'know?

I I'm tryin to do right now, I mean

Y'know I'm sorry for everythang

That I, I I mean y'know

That's fucked up how y'all doin me man

Y'all niggaz could at least send me somethin


"Alright, first four guys, let's go... lock it up"

// Stop Snitchin' //

[Ice Cube]

Ice Cube (yeah!) Callin from a California state penitentiary

(Let me out this motherfucker)

We got over two million motherfuckers locked up

(Let me out this motherfucker) Stop snitchin


Now how many MC's must get booed

Before somebody say don't fuck with Cube (you know!)

I'll strip you nude (butt-ass) in your living room

Face down, paralyzed from the waist down

I'm a buckin clown, but don't fuck around

Doin movies now, but I'll lay you down

South Central style, pull them thangs out

Don't make a millionare have to send you there

You know the story of the tortoise nigga and the hare

Nigga run nigga run never get there

I'ma walk, fuck a bitch when I get there

Nigga this a marathon, ask Farrakhan

Fuck the cemetery that I'm buried on (fuck 'em)

The blood of Ice Cube got to carry on (forever)

Forever what the fuck are they yellin?

"Gangsta Gangsta," nigga stop tellin - stop snitchin

[Chorus]

You can have whatever you want

In the hood, it's do's and don'ts

So when it get hot in this kitchen

Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin

[Ice Cube]

Microphone master, super rhyme maker

Gun blaster, who's the life taker (who?)

Who the fuck is a lifetime Laker?

I slap the Maybeline off Tammy Faye Baker

Who the fuck got more than an acre?

In Los Angeles I got to have paper

I'm a nigga, don't talk to my neighbors

Straight asshole, always up in Vegas (yay yay)

Lay it out for these niggaz to follow

Get the point, but these points is hollow

Now this here, is hard to swallow

But if you do it's like hittin the lotto

Little nigga with big bravado

Hit the throttle niggaz hit the bottle

Can give a fuck if they life is hollow

Where the fuck was you, when I rocked the Apollo, bitch?


Ay, who put this thing together? Me, that's who

Who I trust? Who I trust? ME, THAT'S WHO!


Nigga nigga nigga, can't you see

Somehow your words incarcerate me

Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Lock me up in my prime, Muhammad Ali

Get out whup yo' ass like Muhammad Ali

Rumble in the Jungle, nigga don't play Dumbo

In the hood nigga known as Columbo

Get the people on the phone, tell the jumble

Spit fluid and swear he didn't do it

Got my bottom bitch locked up with Martha Stewart

She say she had the hoe cookin deep dish

She say Martha fuckin cook fish and eat fish

Westside y'all niggaz got to peep this

That's your weakness, can't keep a secret

Don't say shit, boy that's basic

They want to send a nigga back to the slave ship

Stop snitchin

[Chorus]

[New Chorus]

You can have whatever you choose

But out here, it's don'ts and do's

So after we finish this mission

Stop snitchin, nigga stop snitchin

[SB] Okay, okay

[Swizz Beatz: repeat 4X]

One two, in the place to be

You rockin with Ice Cube, and the homey Swizz Beatz


{Keep your fuckin mouth shut man}

// The Nigga Trapp //

[Intro - various dialogue]

Now that's how this shit go!

And I know you don't like me spittin in your motherfuckin face

But ain't a motherfuckin thing, you can do, about a nigga

Punk motherfucker!


Some people may say well, you overdramatized it

No we're not - it's not a drama workshop, it is a reality

Things like that do take place in prisons

The murders, the suicides, as well as the rapes

Do take place inside these human warehouses

[Ice Cube]

Nigga I'm a hustler, act like I'm lovin ya

Don't mind fuckin ya, just like the Governor

Used to be the dope man, rolled a hundred spokes man

When I come through, treat me like the Pope man

Ghetto spokesman, I know niggaz

in Eastside Oakland all the way to Brook-lyn

And they love my shitty drawers, what you smokin?

Think you got the balls, nigga I'm a Trojan

Catchin all that just like a prophylac'

Don't reproduce, that bullshit is whack

Flavor Flav with a white bitch that is whack

Got to put the nigga back in my Cadillac

Take him to the hood, where it's action packed

Let him know that the target's still on his back

It's a hustle called capitalism

Got my niggaz in prison, all stuck in the system yeah

Recognize who's a hustler, George Dubya

He's the one that's sittin back, fuckin ya

With a big dick stuck in ya

I'm from a place where the fuckin Terminator is the Governor


(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)

(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for dinner)

[Chorus: Ice Cube]

The ghetto is a nigga trap, take the cheese

Soon as you do it here come the police

Invented and designed fo' us to fail

Where you gon' end up, dead or in jail

[Ice Cube]

You only got two places

State of California, got two faces

Motherfuckin devils, get straight racist

When they get you in them lonely dark places

Concrete slave ships, never move

Where niggaz like us get used like a mule

Don't let 'em catch you, arrest you

Strip and undress you, throw you in a cesspool

You wanna know the crime of the century

A ghetto elementary, a mental penitentiary

Black man, you never been friend of me

Boy you kin to me, why we enemies?

The ghe-tto is a trap

Fuck where you from, nigga look where you at

Where you wanna be? Point it out on a map

Don't be scared to leave homey, we can come back

If you wanna come back to this bullshit

Most of it comin straight out the pulpit

We got to change our ways in the hood

Understand that it's AIDS in the hood...


The nigga trap... [echoes for a bit]

[Chorus - 2X]


(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)

(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for dinner)
[fades out]

// A History Of Violence (Skit) //

[William Shatner:]
Blacks who ventured across the unmarked border were often attacked
By teenage members of the new gang called The Spook Hunters
One of a handful of white gangs active in this time
It was only natural for L.A.'s newest residents to respond unkind

As white attacks started to increase in the mid 1940's and late 1940's
Blacks started to organize their clubs really as a defensive mechanism
And the boss men or the business men and the Snyder boys and all these
Clubs in south L.A. really were just sorta defending themselves against
White violence that was coming from Huntington Park and Southgate

[William Shatner:]
The demise of the black panthers in Los Angeles is said to be another
Blow to a generation of black teenagers that witnessed many of its role models
Assasinated throughout the 1960's

What I'm sayin in so many words, they shoulda let the panthers
Went on because there probably would never have been no crips and no bloods

// Growin' Up //

Ha ha, that's my
Turn it up 
Uhh, yeah

I hear a beat like this, and think about growin up
House parties, with gangbangers showin up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say Cube get on the mic, blow it up
I used to lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo we should flip it like this
Cause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta
I put the pen to the pad, young was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real

I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane
[x2]

Oh, it's B.W.!
Them on tour and they comin our way
Little one is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other got raped
Same turned around and said me
No you cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang
I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey

I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

From Boyz N the Hood, to XXX 2
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say "We love you Cube!"
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some play toy
A lot of say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody wit you
Cause you talk a lot of about the red, black & blue
And how they treat a called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them misdemeanor
While black people dyin in that God dang arena
Just because I'm actin never stop rappin
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin
Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket
Who you think you wit? Here's another classic

I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

I'm Ruthless, I'm Ruthless..
Street Knowledge..
Lench Mob..
Westside..
Uhh..

I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

Motherfuckers don't know what I been through

I keep my motherfuckin heat in my igloo

And it's lookin for some meat it can get through

Fuck with me, there will be agony

In these streets, it will be a tragedy

Can't you see, it ain't no fag in me

If it was I woulda joined the Academy

[Chorus]


(Click clack, get back, 'fore you niggaz feel that) [4X]

[Ice Cube]

Get back, y'all better get the fuck back

I never take shit from rappers

(Ka-plow!) I'm fuckin mo', niggaz than Napster

Cause youse a trick and your Ghost Rider is Casper

I heard you lost on Fear Factor

Cause you couldn't swallow deez nuts, big as a tractor

You dumb bitch, think I'm an actor

And a nigga couldn't get close enough to slap her

Ice Cube, understand it's real

I'm the nigga of steel, got you _Killin at Will_

Got my nigga a deal, he tried to fuck me and steal

I love the nigga but he now feelin the chill

It's West coast (West coast) East coast (East coast)

North side (North side) let's ride (let's ride)

Let's do it 'til God and the devil collide, c'mon!

[Chorus]

// The Game Lord //

[Ice Cube]

I love chrome and paint, lookin for some motherfuckin corners to bank

West coast what the fuck you thank?

Everybody here off weed and drank (everybody)

Before you check my rims

When you leave the parking lot, check ya limbs

You better check ya friends

and see if ya baby momma left with them

Blacks and Mexicans - stop all that bullshit in the pen

Understand that is us verse them

They can give a fuck if we sink or swim

They give us guns and drugs

then wonder why in the fuck we thugs

I got to show my ass

to thank these motherfuckers for my past

In South Central, Los Angeles - Grandmama smoke cannabis

Granddaughter wanna dance and shit, her own momma can't stand the bitch

[Hook: Ice Cube - repeat 2X]

If you fuckin up, pray to the game lord

Wanna bust a nut? Pray to the game lord

Nigga get ya cup, pray to the game lord

You can throw it up, pray to the game lord

[Ice Cube]

I love where I from, hungry ass niggaz better get you some

Smart ass niggaz play dumb

Y'all can't fuck with the city I run

If I snap my fingers, better curl up just like a fetus

I hope you know Jesus

because if you don't, boy you will see us

Where? Up in your house, two double barrels up in your mouth

You got some 'splainin to do

and don't get the line 'cause we aiming at you

(Ewww!) It's a doggy dog world baby, you a nut and I'ma squirrel baby

Can I get ya in my world baby?

Can ya grease my Jheri curl baby?

That nigga old as hell

They need to throw the motherfuckin momma in jail

Let 'em know

[Hook - repeat 2X]

[Break - repeat 2X]

Fuck wit this if you want to, the game lord will punish you

Punish us if we ain't true, to the game like we 'pose to

[Ice Cube]

I'm the game lord, y'all come now

Casanova niggaz, got the sun down

Run down every hoe that wanna go shoppin

Get they kids, take 'em to the mall, buy 'em somethin

Are you a gentleman?

Big bear wit a nigga named Gentle Ben

Ladies, he'll be yo' friend

Wait for the cable guy - even let him in

Not me, I won't flex or bend

just 'cause a hoe promise me some trim

You better get wit the rest of them

'cause can't none of y'all even fuck wit Kim

Some niggaz was born wit hoe in 'em

I was put on this Earth to spit ism

And I shall return like it's written

And slay all the suckers who be sippin

[Hook - repeat 2X]

// Chrome & Paint //

Nigga what you thank, I got chrome and paint

Bitch what you drank, I got chrome and paint

Smokin that dank in my chrome and paint

Street lights - dance on paint

Street lights - dance on chrome

Street lights - get a nigga home

[Ice Cube]

I am the wrong nigga, too fuckin grown nigga

To go for that nigga, I ain't 'cha hoe nigga

I got, a hair trigger, I am the dome splitter

The deep-sea sniper, you got the wrong niggaz

Retire like Jigga, here comes the Attila the Hun

Killin niggaz for fun, these rappers is done

The bigger they come, the harder they fall

I burn like the sun, continue to ball

He's got nuts and plus the Don touch

and split the fine dutch, Starsky call Hutch

He's laid, with some sluts, up in some guts

Just back, in the cut, he thinks he's King Tut

Cain't fuck, this nigga up, cause just, the nigga luck

That niggaz, really love him and tear the city up

Uhh, even though I'm fuckin with the po'-po'

[Chorus]

[W.C.]

I'm ghetto like grits, die befo' I snitch

Off my ass khakis sag like cellulite tits bitch

Under the suede, headliner and I ain't yo momma

Play with my dollars on yo' ass they'll be layin flowers

I put a hole in your brain with these hollow hot rocks

Hittin the switch, makin the fo' hopscotch

Rollin up imperial in dickie material

All in your periphreal, throwin shells at your vehicle

Clipped up, pimped up, big chipped up

Stacy Adams tips spiffed up, golf hat flipped up

I blow yo' ass off the map, fuck with Dub

I'll have yo' ass rollin home with windshield glass on your lap

Fuck rap, I'm wearin a creased tee, eatin ribs

Laughin at you niggaz on MTV Cribs

I got the chrome thang thang to make the dome stank

Hood life forever bitch, chrome and paint, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

[Ice Cube]

Steal The Show baby

[Mike Epps]

You know a lot of these bitches need an antibiotic

Moxacillin, Penicillin, something with a slin' in it

They want a sugar daddy, they want a man on a fixed income

They want man where they can come over to the old mans house

And go in the back porch and get $30 or $40 every here and there

And get in they honda and ride on off

// You Gotta Lotta That //

[Ice Cube]

Hey... you wit' da ass (you wit' da ass), you wit' da ass (you wit' da ass)

C'mere... wassup?

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg - repeat 2X]

A nigga need a shot of that.. and I know where they got it at

Damn girl, you gotta lotta that

Won't you let a real nigga go and holla back?

[Ice Cube]

Look at you girl, eyes brown, ass round

Feel like a nigga chasin down a rebound

It's bouncin like a basketball, if you got no ass at all

Sorry girl but you won't make the casting call

Skinny bitches need to find that nutritionist

Shit that make yo' ass so thick and delicious

Is it the food or is it the water?

That make your daughter wanna show what Momma taught her

C'mere.. let me whisper in yo' ear (wassup)

Tell ya all that bullshit that you wanna hear (let's fuck)

You prolly hate my fuckin guts in a year

But right about now, you like a nigga's style huh?

How I talk, how I smell, how I smile

How I think, how I fuck, how I grab

Fuck wit' me, ya get ya meat and ya vegetables

Fuck wit' him, ya get a fuckin metrosexual

You want a man stronger than you

Not a motherfucker in the mirror longer than you

Break a nail and his punk ass lookin for glue

You want a nigga wit' a hard dick lookin at you (lookin at you)

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Snoop Dogg]

You came up in there lookin all cute and stuff

You and yo' homegirl, a pimp couldn't get enough

You talk that shit like you weren't up in there just to fuck

Well guess what? Now bitch you wit' us!

Go and spend another blunt, naw roll it up!

What yo' name? A nigga love how you came

You just in need of some game

And I got that good thang, yeah it's a Westside hood thing

Let ya party over day and hit ya wit' that ding-a-ling

I got that good shit, lollipop (lollipop)

And once I get up in ya, I make ya body rock (body rock)

A thick little bad bitch, walk wit' a switch

Now all you need now is some gangster dick

It's the Big Bow Wizzow, you know I'm on the pusszow

Doggystizyle, that make ya kitty kat meow (meow!)

Dick deep, freak-a-leek, fuck some sleep

And don't tell me that I'm... "innnn too deep"

Okay (okay).. alright (alright).. Westside baby girl, we do it all night

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Ice Cube]

Do ya thing girl, fuck what they lookin at

Shake it for me mami, work that pussycat

Do ya thing girl, fuck what they lookin at

Shake it for me mami, work that pussycat

Drop it down now and throw it on a nigga

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

// Spittin' Pollaseeds //

I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I'm spittin' pollaseeds

I'm spittin' pollaseeds
These niggas is too salty
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
Crack 'em one by one
You niggas got me fucked up

[Ice Cube:]
Fuck a ghostwriter, sittin' in the back
Of the studio tryin' to write a nigga rap
It's the muppet show, most niggas need A&R
To tell 'em how to fuck a ho
Ice Cube, true emcee
Write everything I say, even back in the day
I'mma spit it how I feel it, fuck a gimmick
You can keep your catchy lines, I'm bout to write a rhyme
If you got a backpack tryin' to act black
Think you know the culture? You's a fuckin' vulture
You never approached a mic
You're dressed like a dyke sayin' what ya don't like
Who deserve 5 Mics, who deserve 2
But the nigga with 2 still can serve you
This West Coast flow is different than the East
But it ain't no different in the street

[Kokane:]
I'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)
I crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy
Cause the salt might make you choke
(I'm spittin' pollaseeds) I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy
Because these niggas is salty they'll make you choke
Oh oh, you niggas got me fucked up

[Ice Cube:]
I'm spittin' pollaseeds on the porch with the torch
In case these niggas come around to see the Porsche
When I brandish, motherfuckers vanish
They don't understand like a nigga speakin' Spanish
No comprende, me no speak no Engle
Here now yo' ass feelin' tingly
Now you're doin' shit like Darryl Stingley
Don't get stung by the motherfuckin' stingray
Jumpin' over niggas, y'all better king me
Put your rap careers up on eBay
Crazy Toones is the motherfuckin' DJ
Baby drop to your knees, he deserves a BJ
I got a big brother nicknamed CJ
When you see him in the hood take it easy
If you a breezy, take him to the heezy
Do him like Halle Berry did Michael Ealy

[Kokane:]
I'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)
I crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy
Cause the salt might make you choke
I'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)
I crack 'em one by one, cause I don't wanna be greedy
Because these niggas is salty they'll make you choke
Oh oh (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)

[W.C.:]
Quick to twist ya, hit ya, it's the chipper
Pistol gripper, skip-skipper runnin' up in your rear-view mirror
Ready to bust with my bandanna, bumpin' oldies
Cube throw me the lob like Odom to Kobe
So I could bust a Crip Walk on these niggas
Yellow tape off these niggas, fuck all these salty niggas
They can't hold our shit
Gangsta rap ain't dead, motherfuckers just stole our shit
All you niggas owe us alimony
All you did was switch your name and ate our style up like ravioli
On your club raps I'm pissin', talk shit I'll knock your Comodi glasses
Off your face under the transmission, nigga
From the Westside fuckin' up the program
With the surplus hanky hangin' out the Brougham
Dub Sizzla, dippin' on them 'draulics and D's
Spittin' shells at you niggas like pollaseeds

[Kokane:]
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy
Cause the salt might make you choke
I'm spittin' pollaseeds
I crack 'em one by one, cause I don't wanna be greedy
Because these niggas is salty they'll make you choke, oh oh

// Holla @ Cha' Boy //

"Ice Cube!" Back then they used to fuck me

Now that I'm hot these bitches still love me

Everywhere I go they wanna kiss and hug me

They say "Dopeman, dopeman!

Don't wanna see the G-hand (bitch)

I am the man from here to Cleveland

Don't get mad, I get e-van

Try to shake the van, think you're sleep-an

Oh my God this nigga's leak-in

Any dose is a overdose

Leave your punk-ass dead or a comatose (yeah)

And if you don't wanna listen

My shit'll crack you out like Tyrone Bigguns

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]

Holla, yeah

Dumb bitch (I'll holla)

Don't 2-way a nigga man (I'll holla)

Damn!

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
