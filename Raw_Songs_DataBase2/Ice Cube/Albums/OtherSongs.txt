// Come And Get It //

[Hook:]
Oakland Raiders, just win, baby
We are the Oakland Raiders, just win, baby
Don't need no invitation
We are that Raider nation
We rock that black and silver
We make 'em shake and shiver
We make 'em reconsider
And we still committed
So if you want a piece of this, you can come and get it

Touchdown, touchdown
Let's throw a bombon first  down
Let's throw a bombon every down
First we score, then we clown
Having fun, look around
Nobody loud as a Raider crowd
Nobody proud as a Raider crowd
NFL, how you like me now?
We gon' do this Oakland style
Nothing but action, I'm Bo Jackson
Hit the hole, run you over
Goal line, jumpin' over
Going crazy, lose your soul
Lose your mind, in a black hole
Here's the goal: Superbowl
And everybody here get the gold

[Hook]

Al Davis, John Madden
Greg Papaand Darren McFadden
He's a pirate, Ken Stabler
Always will be a Oakland Raider
Art Shell, Gene Upshaw
Jack Tatum, true outlaw
That is Fred Biletnikoff
Lester Hayesis picking it off
Brown brothers, Willie and Tim
Plunkett, Otto, y'all know Jim
Y'all know Lyle, y'all know Ted
Atkinson put you to bed
Dave Casper, Cliff Branch
Tom Floresif you think you can
George Blanda, Howie Long
Marcus Allen come back home

[Hook]

I'm the President of the Raider nation
Please use this as motivation
If you want a piece of this, you can come and get it

// Crowded //

[Verse 1:]
This shit is crowded
When the whole place crowded, I'm about it
And when a nigga is about it, don't doubt it
I've got a pocket full of evil, gettin' love from my people
You don't wanna see the sequel, if you see it…
Everything you wanna be, I'mma be it
Everything you wanna do, I'mma do it
The best you ever smoked, I probably grew it
I'm the fluid and I flow like the ocean
This chickens need lotion
Even use moisturizer… need coachin'
I'm so West Coastin', I'm so slow motion
Baby wanna put it in my face and crank it open
But baby, just put it in my pocket 'cause it's open
And please stop hopin' that a nigga is elopin'
'Cause I ain't…
I'm goin' straight to the bank
And if I have another drink it might be the whole tank

[Hook:]
This shit is crowded – I'm buffaloing hoes
I'm throwin' 'bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded – I'm buffaloing hoes
I'm throwin' 'bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded – I'm buffaloing hoes
I'm throwin' 'bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded – I'm buffaloing hoes
I'm throwin' 'bows in bones, I might break your nose
This shit is crowded

[Verse 2:]
When the whole place crowded, I'm about it
And when a nigga is about it, don't doubt it
I like it wet and sweaty
Hot as the Serengeti, bustin' nuts, bustin' cherries
And it's on…
It ain't never, ever off
Unless you're talkin' 'bout the fuckin' lights in my loft
Unless you're talkin' 'bout the fuckin' Porsche pullin' off
And niggas passin' out when they smell that exhaust
And it's on…
I keep it turnt up and burnt up
When you gon' learn? I'm a head turner
Rich as Ted Turner, fuckin' Tina Turner
Hope that concern ya, get the fuck out the way
Warriors, warriors, please come out and play
You can't keep up, we in the fuckin' Milky Way
And when I come back, these niggas all better pray
It ain't a good day, I might have my AK

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
For me, MC means "move the crowd"
For me, MC means "move the crowd"
For me, MC means "move the crowd"
For me, MC means "move the crowd"

[Verse 2:]
We packed – all together
Like sweaty ass cracks (sweaty ass cracks)
We packed – all together
Like sweaty ass cracks (sweaty ass cracks)
This shit is crowded
I see some of y'all love it
You hope the chick in front of you might try to rub it
But slow the fuck down, 'cause your jeans are too hard
I don't go stupid, I'm a retard
I'm the one pushin' when the crowd get to mushin'
And if I stage dive – you my cushion
And when I'm all about it, you can read all about it
Five in the shotty when I'm in the building, and…

[Hook]

Hit her from the back, grabbing on her shoulders
Hair weave killa, girl don't you get nervous
Cleaning some detergent, all my cars got curtains

My Rollie cost a car, and I don't have a car note
I took her from the bar to the car to the condo

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre' duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But I throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin'
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like I was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is... {Hello..}

[Ice Cube:]
I started this gangsta shit, and this the motherfuckin thanks I get? {Hello..} [x4]

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two .22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love I'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BADBOY
Niggaz wanna front, who got your back? (BIGGIE!)
Niggaz wanna flex, who got the gat? (BIGGIE!)
It ain't hard to tell I'm the east coast overdoser
Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks! {Hello..}

[Ice Cube:]
I started this gangsta shit, and this the motherfuckin thanks I get? {Hello..} [x4]

// I'm Reckless In The Booth //

My juice is 900 proof
Only message to the youth
I'm reckless in the booth
My juice is 900 proof
Only message to the youth
I'm reckless in the booth

I tell you no lies, please recognize
I'll serve your monkey ass, two piece and some fries
Niggas realize, it's not a disguise
This hardcore shit will make your home girl strip
Make you wanna take a sip of that red cup
Guess what, rest up, don't give a fuck
Never did, small shit is irrelevant
Heaven knows only live for the hell of it
Know the elephant, hate anything celibate
Don't really give a damn, what I tell a bitch
Home going to the moon might see you soon
Try to get the outlaw out the saloon
Hear the click clack first then you hear the boom
Get the fuck off my clap, mushroom
Get out my face fore' I drop you
Don't try to gamble, with Earl Campbell (nah-ah)
I scramble your eggs boy
Replace your arms with your motherfucking legs boy
They call me Dexter, Dave Hester, Clyde Drexler
MMA, you's a wrestler

(Real talk)
My juice is 900 proof
Only message to the youth
I'm reckless in the booth
My juice is 900 proof
Only message to the youth
I'm reckless in the booth

I don't know why these suckers is frontin'
Like they ain't runnin' and duckin'
With my team start that buckin' and fuckin'
That's what happen when you get somethin' from nothin'
Any motherfuckers that wanna kick it done out in public
OMG motherfucker and it's good to be home
And I say sorry for the wait but I was burning the throne
It's time to take shit, (take that shit) got no time for the hate bitch
They talk shit, cause they ain't shit (real talk)
It's that rise of the ape shit
With no Cesar, catch me rocking the pro
Like I'm on that number 8 shit
Niggas in the back wit their traps upon their hats
And they guess they pack all black
They'll take your racks on racks on racks nigga
Thank god the gangster's back
And we ain't gotta put up with this brainless rap
Oh my goodness, OMG and I'm reckless in the booth
And I ain't never been less than the truth, motherfucker!

// Nobody Wants To Die //

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Y'all thought I was soft as cotton
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messed around and forgot I was rotten
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
You know my resume
You tell 'em I'm on my way
But nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)
Ah nobody wants to die

I keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny
Don't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny
I'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain
See the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game
Haters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang
Arrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang
But let me explain, like Abel and Cain
That the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper
Revenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge
It depends if I can live with my sins
Lose family and friends (lost em all)
Now you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed
And you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud
If you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth
I'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, son)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (yeah)
But nobody (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody)
Ah nobody wants to die

You forgot where I come from, you forgot what I do
You forgot what you was sayin', cuz I'm blockin' your view
Now I got you on cue, you about to turn blue
Get around me now you actin' like my little nephew
Boy what you wan' do? You ain't gon' do ish
But go take a ish, is 'bout as funky as it get
Now I'ma have to admit, that I was prolly too nice
But take my advice or I'll take your life
Now if you still wanna slice, let's start with the fingers
Let's move to the toes, and end with the penis
See men are from Mars, now you from Venus
How dumb you got to be tryin' to think with the genius
It's the big payback, you can't clown James Brown
See a brother been down ever since Jamestown
You either swim or you're drowned, you either gagged or you're bound
Now you can't make a sound, boy look at you now

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, Crip)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (Go on)
But nobody (Nobody, na)
Ah nobody wants to die

// Real People //

[Intro:]
Come with it
(The only race on the planet is the human one
Real talk
Spread love

[Verse 1 - Ice Cube:]
We used to fight and fuss, we used to yell and cuss
We used to cock and bust now look at us
We done turned to ashes and dust to dust
I shoulda turned the cause and returned the love
I shoulda passed the bud to all the bloods
And leave them slugs with them pigs in the mud
Who the fuck turned 2Pac into a thug?
All I used to get was a pound and a hug
I remember when we used to hate them drugs
Now we can't rap without being fucked up
High in the club but you sound like a drunk
Hard in the street but a jailhouse punk
Me and that nigga, yeah we used to bring the funk
Now we got love and respect like a monk
Understand that we got a lot in common
Homie you in the same boat that I'm in

[Chorus:]
I'm calling all the real people, real people
Let em know that the change gon come
Tell me where the real people? Real people
It's time to wake up and stand as one
Calling all the real people, real people
You still got our faith nah we ain't none
Tell me where the real people out there
The real people out there

[Verse 2 - Common:]
It's a good day when it's me and O'Shea
It's like the times we cheered for O.J
I say Mike, Cube say Kobe
But ain't no more beef, I put that on chief
Blaow, a little homie dead in the streets
It's like the day they compared us to meat
Glad Farrakan prepared us to meet
Now me and bro bringing meals to the meek
Think about my homie locked up like a Rasta
Dude in my ear asking me about the Oscars
I build with the gods to show improvement
Hard to complain, real people going through it
I know the movement like I was Huey Newton
Can't explain why youngin's are shooting
The revolution will not be on the ground
The revolution is who I am, God damn

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
I don't care what your color is
All my real people, real people love this, love this
Be the change

// Sasquatch //

[Intro:]
I think they spotted me

[Hook:]
They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

[Verse 1:]
Michael Joe Jackson used to call me Thriller
All my enemies swear I'm Attila
Vietnam vet, burn down your villa
Captain Crunch scream, serial killer
Out in O-Town I'm a fucking pirate
Think I'm Rodney King? We can start a riot
You a fat bitch, I'm a fucking diet
You in solitary, I'm piece and quiet
This a nightmare on Elm Street
You're just a runaway with a pimp speak
You're a thirsty man, I'm so empty
At your funeral, no sympathy

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
Please check the time, I'm like turpentine
And it's burping time
You exhausted I know, cause I'm overtime
And I'm over the line, come over to mine
I already left
You wanting a rhyme, bitch? I'm So So Def
You ready to shine, I'm already blind, you already lyin'
A nigga ain't buyin' what you selling
Always open; 7/11
When I blow niggas know here come tsunami
You got a bucket list, my list is Bugatti
You that drowning kid at the pool party
I'm the carnivore over your body

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your as
(Don't do it)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your as
(Don't)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your as
What you do? Bring it down and bring me my cash

[Verse 3:]
You'se a fucking prick, but I'm Moby Dick
I'm Darth Vader, you Obi Wan Kenobi, bitch
He's Jim Kelly, y'all, I'm Terry Bradshaw
He is baby ass, I'm like diaper rash
I'm like stinking trash, I'm like party crash
Like getting caught with hash
I'm like your stolen cash
I like you feeling bad, they call me Schleprock
I like the whole country looking at the debt clock
Pyroclastic flow, this is Pompeii
Whoever in the way, turn you into clay
Call me out on name and that's a hurricane
I'll send the wind and the water and the pouring rain
I am boring, mane, I am snoring, mane
I'm the pain that's wearing off the Novacane
I'm the weight you gain, I make your titties hang
I'm the crowded train that just hit the mane

Thirstin' howl, will get you murdered
Come to the boss if you need some work
Come to the boss if you need some hurt
White collar boy, if you check my shirt

Back to the AK's fucking up doorways

Don't act like you don't know where to find me
Now, if you wanna get slimy
Look at all the grimy
Niggas all behind me
You don't wanna go to war so you start to sing
Why can't we be friends? We can be friends
Pussy ass niggas by extent
Pray to the God, repent your sins

That Crazy Toones always high as the moon
That nigga June he is the brother of Bone
And he got a gun that's the color chrome
See my nigga Tony Draper always chasing the paper
And he always keeping gangsta
Bitches catching the vapors
See my homie Starr
You might not know who he are
He in the club with his locs on up in the dark
Boy that nigga Keeb
Get whatever you need

In the business of hurt
See my nigga do work
That's my son Doughboy
And if you get him annoyed
He might drop 'yo ass off
And pull out his Droid
Oh My Goodness
OMG is his brother
Cause of his ass

Smell his finger and I bet that muthafucka will stink
See my homie Deion ain't fuckin' with no peon

Every now and then please don't ask me again
Me and Greenfield been down since '80
I miss rolling in Mercedes with my homie K-Dee
I put money on the books for my nigga J-Dee
See Shorty is a Muslim use to be crazy
I ate dinner with Martin
And had meetings with Magic
Chopped it up with 2Pac
Before it was a tragic

[Savon]
And you ain't running shit but your mouth
Cause shit ain't worked all day and it's on

[Hook: DJ Muggs scratching quotes below]
Ugh, YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Ugh, YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]

[Ice Cube]
Five niggaz on the roof with the proof
And one went out
White boy wanna know what it's all about
Back in St. Louis
Down with King James so everybody knew us
Who that wanna do us? - GOOSE!!
The first motherfucker done went loose
Catch him on the roof, got my news from my Deuce Deuce
Savon, can't be clowned

[Ice-T]
Saw the motherfucker got the critical beat down
On and on the drama continues to ring
For me, I'm known as James the King
I got a partner by my right hand
Though Savon is the hype man
But he thinks that he can do something I can't do
"What's that?" - command the crew
Now, I'm finding out who was really true
Two white boys got my brother on a hostage's tip

[Ice Cube]
Fuck that, I wanna give them full clips
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Ugh, and here come the looters

[Hook: DJ Muggs scratching quotes below]
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]

[Ice Cube]
Ugh, bailed through the skylight
He spends some time, so could you give me a highlight
White boy got to stick his nose in, claimed he seen nothing
Got to break him off something
Rushed down the steps, hands up, sound dumb
Shaking like a bitch is how we found him
Showed him the Machete, he stepped back from the riot
Claimed he ain't never seen a nigga like that
With Don and Cletus, we stepped about seven for two 
And I'm the meanest motherfucker in my crew
Do him, boom, hit another shot
Ran for cover [Gun Shot]

[Ice-T]
Awww shit, got my little brother
I'm not nice tonight, cause you got me in a Gun Fight
Yeah, the cap peeler, big drug dealer
I already had to kill the man
Called up Raymond who is crazy as I am
He got the ammo', he got much guns
Trunk the funk, now, my posse is ready to pump the chumps
I wanna kill them suckers badder than any of them
Let them showed me my brother's health
Savon, don't care, he is my nightmare
I'm trying to slow him up

[Ice Cube]
I wanna blow them up
So you better stay calm with the shooters
Motherfucker

[Hook: DJ Muggs scratching quotes below]
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it

[Ice Cube]
Pour more juice to the scene
Cause Raymond got a trunk full of M16s
Now, bitch give me room
He got Wickey, K.J. and Luther and White Moon 
Cletus and Savon 
Seven motherfuckers that drag like Ping Pong

[Ice-T]
There's a lot of bullets flying
Echoes screeching, there's a lot of motherfuckers dying
All I want is my brother back
13 men in the St. Louis death track

[Ice Cube]
So you better stay calm with the shooters
The shooters, the shooters, the motherfucking looters

[Hook: DJ Muggs scratching quotes below]
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it
YOU GONNA GET YOURS!! -> [Flavor Flav]
Move it

// We Be Ballin' //

[Ice Cube:]
I love this game, yeah
Haha, haha, haha!
Yeah!

We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong

(Booya!) It's back
The NBA's where it's at
We the max
VIP's, watching Shaq stacking up the numbers
Back in the promise stunnah
You ought a check him smarter or a little harder
Now we can fall on land, air and water
Catch a [?] then you think she ought a
You have to order the smarter
Any team like that
Jordan me and Shaq
A dream team pack
Watch my man Allen and I, take it to the rim!
Two minutes left and we winning by ten
We proudly win, we all [?] up
(Boo!) You in my house, you get no love

We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong
(Bring it) Get your ball on!

[Michael Jackson:]
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you

[Shaquille O'Neal:]
Baby like Rolls Royce
Rashaun for short
Keep my flow
Like low punks
Nice and swift
Priceless gift
The part of we hitting
Bigger your bruise
Better field no excuses
Say play at you lose
Pay my dues
Ice Cube is with me
We quite nifty
Ballers making history
By being quick as 50
You ballers, with daisy champ, baby
What's your thing
They don't go whoever, whenever
Emitten' angst (Yeah, yeah!)

I been balling
Shaq calling
There's another game played
LIVE 98' for the fame
Ice Cube, do these kids wanna be him
They die and trade for, [?] Colosseum
We ain't bet you, kill balling
Forward thrust, crossover left-right
Carved in the dust (What!)
Haha, haha, what! (What!)

[Ice Cube:]
We be balling
Everybody likes sort of plays we calling
Your team falling
We ain't stalling
We just slamming and jamming
Like it ain't nothing wrong
Get your ball on!

[Michael Jackson:]
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you

[Ice Cube:]
I'm MVP
So what's up now?
The number two team
Just touchdown
Watch me as I can
I put myself over to the floor
And not going in for the score
It's pulling off my flow
They start to push and shove
The skills us possess
Must come from up above
Look, for everybody waiting on us
And scrub, for everybody hating on us
Their waiting on us
A day only visiting
And their trying to come to my house, and when
I see you watching me, but I'm the flybird
And I can take you to the home, like the doctor (Watch)

As I see her getting home
Does she know
That I'm a superstar?
Don't they know who we are
We going all the way, baby
We going win this war

[Michael Jackson:]
Nothing you can say, nothing you can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
No one to defeat, you'll see what we can do
We be balling you, we be balling you
So hard to defeat, we love just to compete
We be balling you, we be balling you
Hate to make you plead, we'll bring you to your knees
We be balling you, we be balling you

[Ice Cube:]
Shake them off, shake them off, take them off
For the real, for the real, we rock them in
Shake them off, shake them off, take them off
For the real, for the real, we rock them in

We be balling, we be balling...
