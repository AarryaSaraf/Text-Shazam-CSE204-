Ooh... she was alright, she was alright
Gunnin' for, my, myself
Took me all night, took me all right
Not before, twice we blow
Ah, does anybody wanna leave her?
Everybody want her more?
Everybody wanna steal my girl?
I said: "No no no"
"No no no"

The juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Oh, the juice, it's the juice
Let loose that juice
Yeah

Ooh, but she was so hot, she was so hot
Got me for, when I blow
Scratch her all night, scratch her all right
Comin' for, shit shit more
Wanna flip the bird on by me
Wanna hit the fuses low
Wanna do what you want alone
I said: "Go go go"
"Go go go"

It's the juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice
Yeah, alright, ah
Ooh yeah

Rid the juice, rid the juice
Rid the juice, rid the juice
I wanna feel that juice, ah
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Aah, the juice
Wanna leave you with the juice
Yeah, yeah

Been around town, put the lights out
Put the little bird 
Do you feel good, do you know it 
Do you like, a lot, a lot?
Does anybody wanna leave her?
Everybody want her more?
No, no, no 
I said: "No no no"
I said: "No no no"

It's the juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice
Wanna rid the juice, I said, the juice
Let loose, let loose
It's in the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice

Let loose the juice, yeah
