You hypnotize

Honey
Yeah honey
You do it
Woo, do it good
Do it all right
Every night
When you turn off the light
It's outta sight
(Alright)

You hypnotize
Mezmorize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Your dirty eyes

Breathing
Breathing heavy
Heavy
Heavy breathing
Send shivers down my spine
(Make me/and (I'm/you're)) so glad that you're mine
(When you're so bad and you're mine)
That's what turns me on
All night long

You hypnotize
Mesmorize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
You got dirty eyes
Dirty eyes

Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
I love your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Right through me
Your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
