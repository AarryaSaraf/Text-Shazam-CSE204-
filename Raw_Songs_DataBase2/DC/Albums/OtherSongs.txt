// Back Seat Confidential //

Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rolling at the drive-in show
Going to sit in the back in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there is a chance she might
There is no woman in the world I know
That hasn't had her knickers on the automobile floor

What's that [?] sound
Things going down
Look at what is going round
Back seat confidential

Said to buy a rubber by the cigarette stand
Dying to get it off so that I can get in
Doing my best to make a good connection
She say what you gonna do about my protection?
All right mama, got to listen to me
Last chance thrill it is half past three
Hugging and kissing will be real nice
Every man's got his price

What's that [?] sound
Things going down
Look at what is going round
Back seat confidential

Old man's car on a Saturday night
Got me a woman, me I feel alright
Rock and rolling at the drive-in show
Going to sit in the back in the passion row
Turn up the soundtrack, turn down the lights
Chance she won't but there is a chance she might
There is no woman in the world I know
That hasn't had her knickers on the automobile floor

What's that [?] sound
Things going down
Look at what is going round
Back seat confidential

Around
Back seat confidential

// Big Gun //

Riot on the radio
Pictures on the TV
Invader man take what he can
Shootout on the silver screen
Sticking 'em up and knocking 'em down
Living out a fantasy
There's a bad man cruisin' around
In a big black limousine

Don't let it be wrong
Don't let it be right
Get in his way
You're dead in his sights

Big gun
Big gun, number one
Big gun
Big gun kick the hell out of you

Terminators, Uzi makers
Shooting up Hollywood
Snakes alive with a .45
Gettin' up and doin' no good
If you ain't wise, they'll cannibalize
Tear the flesh off you
Classified lady killers
Playing in the human zoo

He saddle you up
And take you to town
Better look out
When he come around

Big gun

// Bonny //

I will take the high road
And you will take the low road
And I will be in Scotland before you
But me and my true love
Will never meet again
On the bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond

// Borrowed Time //

Got the word, getting ready
Gonna get my pay from union man
On a lake, boatin' heavy
Where the action is hot, is where I am
No town, no city
Gonna be free from the jumping jack
Kiss of life, getting gritty
If the mule don't kick, you know the mule don't ride

And I know, yes I know, woah I know
That's the way to go
And I know, and I know, ooh
I know I'm gonna, gettin' down the road

'Cause I'm livin' on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
No sign

Call me names, call me crazy
Don't try to stop me when I feel this way
It's a game, whoopsy-daisy
Here come another girl to make my day

And I know, yes I know, an' I know
That's the way it go
And I know, yes I know
I'm gonna get a bone when I'm on the road

'Cause I'm living on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
'Cause I'm living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign

So long
Goodbye
Good luck
Au revoir, baby

Look out people
Nothin' left to lose, 'cause I'm

Living on borrowed time
You do it your way, I'll do it mine
Living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign
Yes, I'm living on borrowed time
Living on borrowed time
I'm living on borrowed time
Don't need a shove, don't need a sign, no sign

I don't need a sign to show me the way

// Carry Me Home //

Well, bartender's working on a late night shift
Cheap bums and blondes and barmaids on a midnight drift
And the dance band's playing the same old sling
I'm sinkin' whiskey and you're sippin' fine wine
I don't know what it is you're trying to prove
Well, it should be you, but it's me who can hardly move
And I've got my reputation lyin' on the line
Come on, baby, be a good dog, and
And help the blind

Oh, won't you carry me home?
Oh, won't you carry me home?
Oh, won't you carry me home?

Like a truck, pick me up

You ain't no lady, but you sure got taste in men
That head of yours has got you by, time and time again
My arms and legs are achin' and my head's about to blow
And your back's been breakin' and I'd hate to spoil the show
But I just spent next week's wages and I'm right out of coin
But you want more and it's half past four, and they want to close the joint
And we can't afford a taxi, and it's too late for the bus
But I've been told by friends of mine you're someone I can trust

Carry me home
Oh, won't you carry me home?
Carry me home

Don't leave me lying here, in all this beer!

You drank all your booze and half of mine
I'm bleary eyed and you're waiting for the sunshine to come and kill me
Just like the man who threw me on the floor
Don't matter, while I'm down here, I might as well try and find the back end door
Excuse me, have you seen it?
It's about this big
And have you got a plastic bag?
'Cause I'm gonna be sick
I'm dead drunk and heavin'
Hangin' upside down
And you're gettin' up and leavin'
You think I'm gonna drown

Carry me home
Oh, won't you carry me home? (I need your help)
Carry me home
(Hahahahaha)
Carry me home
Oh, won't you carry me home?
Carry me home

// Crabsody In Blue //

Well, they moved on down
And they crawled around

Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

And you start to scratch
When they start to hatch

Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues

Ooh, but when they start to bite
Then it's time you saw the light
For an appointment
I know
Before you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment

Mulligan

Well, the doctor said
"We got to make 'em dead"

Walkin' sideways
Side-way walkin'
Give me the blues
And when you start to scream
That's when you apply the cream
Blues ointment
And when they start to itch
You go out and you take the bitch
For an appointment

Well you rub it on
And you rub it in

Stops 'em walkin'
Side-way walkin'
Gives them the blues
Side-way walkin'
Side-way walkin'
They've got the blues
Give them the blues
They got the blues
Give them the blues

// Dirty Eyes //

You hypnotize

Honey
Yeah honey
You do it
Woo, do it good
Do it all right
Every night
When you turn off the light
It's outta sight
(Alright)

You hypnotize
Mezmorize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Your dirty eyes

Breathing
Breathing heavy
Heavy
Heavy breathing
Send shivers down my spine
(Make me/and (I'm/you're)) so glad that you're mine
(When you're so bad and you're mine)
That's what turns me on
All night long

You hypnotize
Mesmorize
With your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
You got dirty eyes
Dirty eyes

Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
I love your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Right through me
Your dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes
Dirty eyes

// Down On The Borderline //

Ooh, yeah

She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

I'm on the borderline
On the borderline

She goes struttin' 'round, and she shows so much
With a neon sign saying, "Don't you touch"
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
She use me like an anchor, got a hold on me

(On the borderline) See the danger sign
(On the borderline) Gettin' outta line
(On the borderline) But it feels so good
On the borderline
On the borderline
On the borderline
Borderline, let's go

You know, I shoot the dice to climb the money tree
But the poker man dealt a foul to me
She doesn't want you when your pocket's dry
The queen of hearts will kill you when your ace is high

On the borderline
On the borderline

She's an idle child, high society
Never pushed a broom, didn't physically
Her eyes are down on you, her nose is up
Never spill your whiskey when she fill your cup

(On the borderline) See the danger sign
(On the borderline) Gettin' outta line
(On the borderline) But it feels so good
On the borderline
On the borderline
On the borderline, yeah
On the borderline, feelin' good
I'm on the borderline, yeah
Borderline
Yeah, they're gonna meet you there
Oh yeah

I'm goin' across the borderline
I'm on the borderline (can you take it?)
On the borderline (you might love it)
On the borderline
If you want me, yes
Meet me on the borderline

// Let It Loose //

Ooh... she was alright, she was alright
Gunnin' for, my, myself
Took me all night, took me all right
Not before, twice we blow
Ah, does anybody wanna leave her?
Everybody want her more?
Everybody wanna steal my girl?
I said: "No no no"
"No no no"

The juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Oh, the juice, it's the juice
Let loose that juice
Yeah

Ooh, but she was so hot, she was so hot
Got me for, when I blow
Scratch her all night, scratch her all right
Comin' for, shit shit more
Wanna flip the bird on by me
Wanna hit the fuses low
Wanna do what you want alone
I said: "Go go go"
"Go go go"

It's the juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice
Yeah, alright, ah
Ooh yeah

Rid the juice, rid the juice
Rid the juice, rid the juice
I wanna feel that juice, ah
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Aah, the juice
Wanna leave you with the juice
Yeah, yeah

Been around town, put the lights out
Put the little bird [?]
Do you feel good, do you know it [?]
Do you like, a lot, a lot?
Does anybody wanna leave her?
Everybody want her more?
No, no, no [?]
I said: "No no no"
I said: "No no no"

It's the juice, it's the juice
Let loose, let loose
Rid the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice
Wanna rid the juice, I said, the juice
Let loose, let loose
It's in the juice, rid the juice
Let loose that juice

Let loose the juice, yeah

// Love Song //

I can tell by the look in your eye
I can tell by the way you sigh
That you know I've been thinking of you
And you know what I want to do

Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean

When you smile, I see stars in the sky
When you smile, I see sunrise
And I know you've been thinking of me
And I know how you want it to be

Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean
Oh, Jean

I can tell by the things you say
I can tell that you know the way
And I know what you want me to do
Oh, I've got hearts and flowers for you

If you leave me, you'll make me cry
When I think of you saying goodbye
Oh the sky turns a, a deeper blue
That's – that's how I'd feel if I lost you

Jean, oh jean
Don't go and leave me
'Cause I love, I love you, I love you, don't leave me
It would make me cry, if you said goodbye
Don't go away Jean, don't you leave baby, baby

// R.I.P. (Rock In Peace) //

Ah, leave me alone
Like a dog with a bone
Like a stone that's been thrown
Let me be on my own

Let me rock

Let me rock in peace

Out of my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Ooh, feels good
Mama, mama
Just like I knew it would

I get my kicks
Outta playing my licks
Outta laying my chicks
Down on Route 66

Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

(Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Just let me rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Oh, let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Yeah, that feels good
Hey, mama
Just like I knew it would

Let me rock

// Rockin' In The Parlour //

I met her in Caroline
'Round about sixty-nine
Well she came up to me and said, "Hi there honey
How'd you like to come along"

'Cause we're gonna have a party
Yeah a rock 'n' roll party
Well we're gonna have a party
And before I knew
We were rocking in the parlour
Rocking in the parlour

Well the next time I saw her roll
Was way down in Mexico
She said, "I've got some booze around at my place
So come along and have some fun"

'Cause we're gonna have a party
Yeah a rock 'n' roll party
Well we're gonna have a party
And before I knew
We were rocking in the parlour
Rocking in the parlour

// School Days //

Up in the mornin', out to school
The teacher is teaching the golden rule
American history, practical math
You're studying hard and you're hoping to pass
You're working your finger right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

"Ring, ring", goes the bell
The cook in the kitchen's ready to sell
But you're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you get time to eat
Well, back in the classroom, open your books
Ooh, the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll
Hail, hail rock and roll

As soon as 3 o'clock rolls around
And ya lay your burden down
Throw down your books and out of your seat
You go down the hallway, into the street
And you're tryin' to forget just where you been
You find a juke joint, you go in
You drop the coin right into the slot
You gonna have something that's really hot (like me, girl)
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long, been wantin' to dance
And ya feel the music from head to toe
It's round, and round, and round we go

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll

Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll
Rock, rock, rock and roll

// Snake Eye //

You paint a picture, so it's plain to see
Ain't no hidin', no security
I'll be watchin' every move you make
When you hear my rattle, better be awake

Snake eyes, watchin'
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, oh, it's comin'
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye
No way

You leave a footprint for my eye to see
Catch an echo from a lock and key
From the shadow, or behind a rock
Get your anti-venom from the doctor's cup

Snake eyes, I'm watchin'
Snake eyes, look out
Snake eyes, ooh, it's comin'
Snake eyes
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye

Snake eyes
Snake eyes, ooh
That snake eye
Snake eyes

Hear a rustle from behind a tree
Get you runnin' home to sanctuary
Bolt the door, and you think you're safe?
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Wrong again, child!

Snake eye, watchin'
Snake eyes, oh, look out
Snake eyes, it's coming
Snake eyes, ooh
They got the snake eye
Ain't no escaping from the snake eye
Ooh, like my snake eye, always watchin'
Snake eye
Ain't no escaping from the
Just keep a look out for the
Snake eye

// Stick Around //

You've been smiling lately baby
You been singing in the bath
You been acting like a lady
Not a dirty photograph

Then tonight you came home early
Packed a bag or two
It's been worrying me, honey
Just what you're going to do

Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, baby
Stick around

Well, you came on like a hurricane
About a month ago
Blowing like a stiff breeze
Always on the go

All the good times that we had, baby
All stayed in the past
All the good lays that I get
Never seem to last

Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, baby
Stick around
C'mon, baby, sit on this!

What have I been doing lately
To make you want to go?
I take you out dancing
Honey, we can go out to a show

Spend a night romancing
Nights out on the town
Listen to me, baby
You'll be glad you stuck around

Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around, yeah
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around, yeah
Stick around
