// Problem Child //

Cop this

I'm hot
And when I'm not, I'm cold as ice
Get out my way
Just step aside, or pay the price

What I want, I take
What I don't, I break
And I don't want you
With a flick (of) my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild

Make my stand, no man's land
On my own
Man in blue, it's up to you
The seed is sown

What I want, I stash
What I don't, I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I got a .45
And I never miss

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Every night
Street alight
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win, they lose

What I need, I like
What I don't, I fight
And I don't like you
Say, "Bye, bye" while you're still alive
Your time is through

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

You've got your troubles, I've got mine

// Go Down //

One, two, three

Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long?
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby, since you been gone
Ain't no one I know, do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick the way you do

You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
You do it different, ain't the way you speak
No, that's just the way

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum, sting me like a bumble bee (zzz)
I'll be around to see you about, about half past ten
Ain't felt this good since, I don't know when

You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that you love to taste
On those lovely lips
So

Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down

Ooh baby, rub it on
Oh, it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's, it's been so long
Ain't no else got a touch like you
I let you doing things to me I let no other woman do
Ooh, it feels good
Oh feels good
Oh yeah
Oh, you do it like you should
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh yeah, yeah
I love you so much
Make me so glad I'm a man

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

// Dog Eat Dog //

Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat, too
The French eat frog
An' I eat you
Business man, when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust?
Do you sign your life away?
Do you write your name in dust?

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up, you win
Down, you lose
It's anybody's game

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Woof!

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie; that's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for something free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
"Hey, what's in it for me?"

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog

// Let There Be Rock //

In the beginning
Back in nineteen-fifty-five
Man didn't know about a rock 'n' roll show
An' all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news

He said, "Let there be sound"
There was sound
"Let there be light"
There was light
"Let there be drums"
There was drums
"Let there be guitar"
There was guitar

Oh, let there be rock

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
And all across the land, every rockin' band
Was blowing up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The businessmen got rich
And in every bar, there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There were fifteen-million fingers
Learning how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say:

"Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar"

Oh, let there be rock

One night, in the club called "The Shaking Hand"
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good, and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:

"Let there be rock"

// Bad Boy Boogie //

On the day I was born, the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day, I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of everyone

They said, "stop"
I said, "go"
They said, "fast"
I said, "slow"
They said, "yes"
I said, "no"
I do the bad boy boogie

Being a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women, come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be

I said, "right"
And they said, "left"
I said, "east"
And they said, "west"
I said, "up"
And they said, "down"
I do the bad boy boogie
All over town

I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love 'till the day I die
I just line 'em up
And I knock them down
And they all came a running when the word got around
(Just keep runnin')

(Bad boy boogie) I said, "up"
They said, "down"
(Bad boy boogie) They said, "straight"
I said, "round"
(Bad boy boogie) They said, "lost"
I said, "found"
(Bad boy boogie) I said, "free"
They said, "bound"

Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie

// Overdose //

I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man, don't you understand?
And a man can sometime lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up, big hunk of love
Hope you can pull me through

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Oh, woman, you give to me
More than I can take
But listen, honey
I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of that harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell and I'm sinking fast
And I don't need no cure

I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
Ain't nothing I can do
I overdosed on you

Then I was happy as a man (can) be
Too far gone to save
Died of love
And plenty of
Just write on my grave

"I overdosed on you"
I overdosed on you
Crazy, but it's true
But nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

On you
On you
On you
All over you
All over you
All over
I overdosed
Overdosed
Overdosed, on you
Overdosed

// Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be //

Hey, you!

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes, not
Puts me down, fool me around
Why she do it to me?
Out for satisfaction, any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be

She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't a bad place to be

Spends my money, drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinking, "Hey, just a minute
Something ain't right"
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
All the same, you playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies

Don't mind her playing demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell, then let me say
It's heavenly

Hell ain't a bad place to be

End of the night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears it apart
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't a bad place to be
I said, hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell ain't a bad place to be
You know, that hell ain't a bad place to be

// Whole Lotta Rosie //

Wan' tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
Ah, come to loving
She steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Forty-two, thirty-nine, fifty-six
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things
Doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighing in at nineteen stone

You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Oh, honey, you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one that turn me
Only one that turn me on
All through the night time
And right around the clock
Woo, to my surprise, Rosie never stopped

She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Oh, you're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman-man-man-man-man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
