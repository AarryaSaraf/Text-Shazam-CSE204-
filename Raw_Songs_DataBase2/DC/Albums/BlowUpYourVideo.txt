// Heatseeker //

"One, two
One, two, three, four"

Ooh, we're getting ready

Ready, go!

Ha ha ha

Get ready

Ooh, we're gettin' ready to rock
We're gettin' ready to roll
I'm gonna turn up the heat
I'm gonna fire up the coal

I gotta keep that motor turning
I gotta keep that engine clean
I gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

And I'm a heatseeker charging up the sky
And I'm a heatseeker
And I, I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
To hose me down

We're gettin' ready to break
Gettin' ready to go
Get your shoes off and shake
Get your head down and blow

You gotta keep that woman firing
You gotta keep that circuit clean
You gotta make her sound the siren
You gotta hear that lady scream

'Cause I'm a heatseeker, burning up the town
And I'm a heatseeker, and I don't
I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Don't hose me down

Aw, here it come

Ready?
Heatseeker

I want to see you get up
And see the whites of your eyes

And I'm a heatseeker
(Heatseeker)

Yeah
I'm gonna measure you up
I'm gonna try you for size

And I'm a heatseeker

Gotta keep that motor turning
Ya gotta keep that engine clean
Ya gotta keep those tires burning
I've got the best you've ever seen

And I'm a heatseeker
And I don't need no life preserver
I don't need no one to hose me down
Whoa, I'm a heatseeker
And I'm a heatseeker
Heatseeker

Out on the street, feel the heat
Ow!

// That's The Way I Wanna Rock 'N' Roll //

Party gonna happen at the Union Hall
Shaking to the rhythm 'till everybody fall
Pickin' up my woman in my Chevrolet
Glory-hallelujah, gonna rock the night away

I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll

Now there's a blue suede boppin' on a high-heeled shoe
Balling 'round together like a wrecking crew, said ha
Oh, be-boppa Lula, baby, what I'll say
You gotta get a dose of rock and roll on each and every day

I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll

I'm gonna blow up my video
Shut down my radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll, yeah
That's the way

Ooh, that's the way I like my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
And that's the way
And that's the way I want my rock and roll
And that's the way
That's the way
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
That's the way

To rock and roll

I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll (Roll, roll, roll)
That's the way I want it (Roll, roll, roll)
Gotta hear it loud
Gonna take the town, turn around, gonna roll
Roll, roll

Blow up my video
Shut down my radio
I told the boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll

// Meanstreak //

(Ooh yeah)

I've been to the left, I've been to the right
I've found myself in Abu Dhabi, just a mirage in the night
Been to the high, I've been to the low
And I've been to lots of places that I didn't wanna go
But I ain't seen nothing to get me off my ass
And laughed at all the jokers want to make me walk on glass
I could walk there, or I could crawl
And I was meaner than a bad dog
With his back against the wall

Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call

Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Meanstreak
They call me "meanstreak"

I just don't know who I want to be
The count of Monte Cristo or the sheik of Araby
Eaten rich, yeah, and I've eaten free
And I'm the perfect culture vulture in the face of poverty
And I ain't met no one who told me I got class
They say never feed the animal
The boy's got too much flesh
I'm the guy, ah, ya just can't teach
And I always kick the castle that's
Been built up on the beach (heh ha)

Animal, animal
Cannibal, cannibal
See 'em fall, see 'em fall
I'm the guy that they call

What's your name?

Meanstreak
I got a meanstreak
Warn 'em that I'm back
I got a meanstreak
Want to feel a meanstreak?
They call me "meanstreak"
[?], meanstreak
What's my name?
Meanstreak

// Go Zone //

Want some relaxation
Need to get some R'N'R
(That's rest and recreation)
Don't need no vacation
I don't have to go that far
(I've got better things to do with my money)

Don't need no private eye
Forget the F.B.I
'Cause when the beaver sings
You know I'm closing in, yeah

To the go zone
Ready to fly in the go zone
Standin' up high in the go zone
Down on the block in the go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

Gotta have my candy
Gotta have my sugar sweet
(I wanna give you a treat)
Givin' you directions
You don't have to use your feet
(Why, we're on the same street, baby)

You've got to travel south
South of my hungry mouth
And there you'll find a friend
Until the bitter end

To the go zone
Ready to fly in the go zone
Standin' up high in the go zone
Down on the block in the go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

Ooh yeah
What you gonna find down there?
Ain't no red light to stop you

Get yourself a ticket

To the go zone
Ready to fly in the go zone
Standin' up high in the go zone
Down on the block in the go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down in the go zone

In the go zone
Leave me to die in the go zone
Standing up high in the go zone
Down on the block
Go zone
Ready to rock
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
In the go zone

// Kissin' Dynamite //

Here she come, here she come
Eatin' up the thrill
Sugar cane, sugar cane
Dressin' up to kill

Like a fireball in the shadow
Like a storm that's gonna show
Like an overwound volcano
Gettin' set to blow, set to blow
She got a nasty reputation
She got a healthy appetite
When she needs some detonation
She set the fuse alight, the fuse alight

Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Whoa, I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

Let it rain, let it rain
Let me feel it pour
Let it slide, let it slide
Let me feel the core

Like a thunder in the mountain
Like the lightning in the sky
Like the eye of a wild tornado
She watch it all go by, all go by
Then she kill for recreation
And she play her games at night
She want to work on her vocation
She set the world alight, set the world alight

Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Whoa, I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Whoa, I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

(Dynamite), here it come
(Dynamite), gonna blow
(Dynamite), just pourin' on you
(Dynamite), like a volcano
(Dynamite), she got an imagination on recreation, alright
(Dynamite), that's where you want it, that's the way he'll go
(Dynamite)

Feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite
Whoa, I feel like kissin' dynamite
Feel like kissin' dynamite

// Nick Of Time //

Wrong track, wrong line
This train never run on time
Bad blood, bad news
Long rope, got nothing to lose
Mad bull seein' red
Coming at me, happy when I'm dead
Jump a fence, get away
Ain't got a liking for the games he plays
What you gonna do?

Everybody tryin' to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by

Saved in the nick of time
I was saved in the nick of time

Slow plane, hard rain
Cold sweat and I feel the strain
Look down, no ground
Black sky, just the engine sound
Bail out, goodbye
Take my chances, I don't want to die
Count ten, just pray
The nick of time will save me any day
What you gonna do?

Everybody love a hero, honey
Living on the danger line
Saved by

Saved in the nick of time
Yeah, saved in the nick of time

Lose sleep, get grief
Sunday, gettin' no relief
Quick punch, closed eye
You didn't do it, you wonder why
Lynch mob on your tail
Think they were searching for the holy grail
Leave town, get away
I didn't figure on them anyway
No I didn't

Everybody trying to find you guilty
Make you wanna toe the line
Saved by

Saved in the nick of time
Oh yeah
On the nick of time
In the nick of time
I was saved – in – the – nick – of – time

// Some Sin For Nothin' //

Heroes
Hard to find
Don't make the news till they're doing time
Schemers
Turn the screw
They get the word and they drop on you
Lay down the law
Black of the night
Run up a score
The vice is right
Dealers looking 'round
Wheel is turning 'round
Coming 'round on you
Some sin for gold, some sin for shame
Some sin for cash, some sin for gain
Some sin for wine, some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool who's gonna have to
Sin for nothin'
Nothing at all

Nero
Evil mind
He was born way before his time
Lead on
Down below
You got it right and away you go
You gotta
Lay down the rules
Push up the price
Turn on the heat
Put you on ice
Dealers looking 'round
Wheel is turning 'round
Coming 'round for you
Some sin for gold, some sin for shame
Some sin for cash, some sin for gain
Some sin for wine, some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool who's gonna have to
Sin for nothin'

Some sin for gold, some sin for shame
Some sin for cash, some sin for gain
Some sin for wine, some sin for pain
But I ain't gonna be the fool
Who's gonna have to sin for nothin'

Ain't gonna sin for nothin'
You get nothing for nothing
Ain't gonna sin for nothin'
That don't make no sense, no, no

// Ruff Stuff //

I like 'em big, and I like 'em small
And if I had to take the oath, I would take them all
Gimme that rough stuff
(It's what I want)

She's a saint, she's a sinner
She's a rave, rave, rave
She's a woman, she's a winner
In every way, way, way

She don't want love
Nor cabaret, that's out
She like to play it wild
That suits me fine
I like it better when she read my mind

You know, don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't wanna play that game

Just gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here

Make you shake, make you shiver
Make you pray, pray, pray
Gonna make you quake, make you quiver
And turn you grey, grey, grey

I don't need brakes
They slow me down too much
They keep me out of touch
They lock me out
I like it better when I pull the pin

And I don't want a woman with a ball and chain
Don't want to play that game

Just gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
You don't want ruff stuff?
Don't want your face around here

I like them big, and I like 'em small
And if you asked me to take an oath
Why, I would take them all

Gimme that ruff stuff
Gimme that ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
Babe, I want ruff stuff
I want ruff stuff, baby
Baby, gimme ruff stuff
I'm takin' all the ruff stuff
I want it, yeah

Don't want your face 'round here, that's it
Don't want your face 'round here
I don't want your face around my backyard any more
I don't

// Two's Up //

Three's company
Come on

Last stand, and on my last dime
I ain't got the sense to leave, the dealer's cutting fine
Last throw, back against the wall
Dependin' where the money is, is where I'm going to fall
Ace high, hide your poker eyes
I didn't want to laugh too much when I picked up the prize
Lady Luck standing at my side
I leave with more than I brought in, and I'll get out with my life
Get out with my life

I go, you go
She go, we go

Two's up
Yeah, it's a two's up
Gimme head (Two's up)
Gimme tails (Two's up)
Gimme double up and coming, doubled over on the rails
Gimme two's up, it's what I want, yeah
Alright

High up, when you're looking down
Then you see two animals just foolin' you around
Stray dogs, gonna take them in
I don't know what your names are
Where you're goin' and where you been
All day, it's difficult to say
Who is doing what to who, who's out on the play
I love the way you slide and slip
Like the way you girls work and ya make that partnership
Make that partnership

I go, you go
She go, we go

Two's up
Yeah, it's a two's up
Gimme head (Two's up)
Gimme tails (Two's up)
Gimme double up and coming, doubled over on the rails
Gimme two's up, it's what I want, yeah
Alright

(Gotta give me double or quits)

Two's up, two's up
Like your partnership
Like the way you slip, ooh
There ain't nothing like a (Two's up)
That's the way it is, (Two's up)
It's what I want to hear
Gimme head (Two's up)
Gimme tails (Two's up)
Gimme double up and coming, over on the rails
(Two's up), it's locomotion
(Two's up), you drive me wild
Gimme high (Two's up)
Gimme low (Two's up)
Gimme twice the satisfaction, twice as far to go
And it's a (Two's up)
It's gonna be (Two's up)
We're going to have a two's up, two's up, two's up, two's up
There ain't nothing like a two's up

// This Means War //

Keep your head down

I
I want you
I want you to
I want you to march
Eyes goes right, shoulder arms
Left wheel turn, show your charms
Change your clothes, cut your hair
Ain't no joke, ain't no place for kids

When the flags are high, hear the battle cry
Treaty gone, see the bandit fly
Dig that trench, watch that blast
Shell-shock come, comin' fast
Name and rank, on parade
We might get laid by a hand grenade
Do you know what it means?
Do you know what it means?

This
Means
War

This means war
This means war
This means war
I said this means war
This means war
This means war

The bullet got your number on it

Run for cover
Hit the dirt
Call for your mother

I
I need you
I need you to
I need you to fire
Cock your gun, wet your sights
Get the bull, dead to rights
Volunteer, one pace back
On the beach
Ain't no place for kids

Well, the flack is high on the bomber run
You don't talk back to an ack-ack gun
Fire rage, and you're in a blitz
Keep your head, or you're blown to bits
Name and rank on parade
Might get laid by a hand grenade
You know what it means?
Do you know what it means?

This
Means
War

Who go there, is it friend or foe?
Propaganda time on the radio
Top brass shout as they clown around
And peace talks die in Geneva town
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means war)
Do you know what it means? (This means...)

This means war
This means war
This means war
I said this means war
This means war
This means war

This means war
This means war
This means war
I said this means war
This means war
This means war

Where's the Seventh Calvary?

This means war
Told you before
I said, this means war
You know the score
I said, this means war
This means war

This
Means
War

You're all dead
