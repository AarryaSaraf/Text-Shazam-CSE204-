// Ride On //

It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain't too young to worry
And I ain't too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
Mmmh and another empty bed
Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

Mmmh, that's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do

I'm gonna ride on
Ride on (Ride on)
Standing on the edge of the road (Ride on)
Thumb in the air (Ride on)
One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
'Till then I'll just keep riding on

Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street
And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

But I'm lonely
Lord, I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?

(Ride on, ride on)
Got myself a one-way ticket (Ride on, ride on)
Goin' the wrong way (Ride on)
Gonna change my evil ways
...One of these days
One of these days

(Ride on, ride on)
I'm gonna ride on (Ride on)
Mmmh, lookin' for a truck (Ride on)
Mmm-hm, keep on riding
Ridin' on and on and on and on and on and on and on
(Ride on, ride on)
Gonna have myself a good time (Ride on)
Mmm, yeah (Ride on)
Ride, ride, ride (Ride on)
One of these days (Ride on)
One of these days

// Hells Bells //

I'm a rolling thunder, pouring rain
I'm coming on like a hurricane
My lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young, but you're gonna die

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you

Hell's bells
Yeah, hell's bells
You got me ringing
Hell's bells
My temperature's high
Hell's bells

I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil, you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
'Cause if good's on the left, then I'm sticking to the right

I won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
I got my bell, I'm gonna take you to hell
I'm gonna get you, Satan get you

Hell's bells
Oh, hell's bells
You got me ringing
Hell's bells
My temperature's high
Hell's bells

Hell's bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's bells, he's ringing them now
Those hell's bells, the temperature's high
Hell's bells, across the sky
Hell's bells, they're taking you down
Hell's bells, they're dragging you under
Hell's bells, gonna split the night
Hell's bells, there's no way to fight, yeah

Hell's bells

// You Shook Me All Night Long //

She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long

// Shake Your Foundations //

Ya gotta see me leanin' on the bar
I got my head in a whiskey jar
Feelin' good, 'cause the city's alive
I'm gettin' ready to rock and jive
I get up and I slide across the floor
You want to come or I'll meet you at the door?
No one can stop us 'cause we're feeling too right
We're gonna steal our way around the night
Alright, alright

Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake

I was takin' no liberties
She getting hotter off the heat on me
I was oilin', she was slick
Lickin' off the sweat, her favorite trick, yeah
"Help me, help me please (yes)
Tame this animal, help me to breathe"
I said, "No, no way
You gotta come with me all of the way"
"Okay, I'll play"

Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake

Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it

We had the night, we had the time
She had the sugar and I had the wine
Took my hand, shook me to the core
Told me not to touch, but she was coming back for more
You know what for
Aye, aye, aye, aye

Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations
Aye-aye-oh, shake it to the floor
Aye-aye-oh, shake your foundations

Make you shake

// Sink The Pink //

Put your gear into fire
Lay your bullets on the ground
Turn your head to desire
There's a woman going down

She said she'd rough you up, all the way
And she gonna spit you out
Count your days
She said, "choice is yours", casually
"So, why don't you do what comes naturally?"

Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink

Got a fever running high
Give you wings to make you fly
She school you like a fool
She make you break the rules

She wanna get a shot, hit that spot
And I'm gonna rack 'em up, get that hot
She say, "make it good, satisfy"
You know that woman got Dallas eyes

Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink

I want you to sing it for me

Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old-fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Going to show you a good time
Sink the pink
Sink the pink

// Who Made Who //

The video games say, "Play me"
Face it on a level, but it take you every time on a one-on-one
Feelin' running down your spine
Nothin' gonna save your one last dime 'cause it own you
Through and through
The databank know my number
Says I got to pay 'cause I made the grade last year
Feel it when I turn the screw
Kick you 'round the world
There ain't a thing that it can't do
Do to you, yeah

Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Who made who, who turned the screw?

Satellites send me picture
Get it in the aisle
Take it to the wall
Spinnin' like a dynamo
Feel it goin' round and round
Running outta chips, you got no line in an 8-bit town
So don't look down, no

Who made who, who made you?
Who made who, ain't nobody told you?
Who made who, who made you?
If you made them and they made you
Who picked up the bill and who made who?
Ain't nobody told you?

Who made who?
Who made you?
Who made who?
And who made who?
Yeah
Nobody told you?
