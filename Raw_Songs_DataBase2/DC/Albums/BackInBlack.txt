// What Do You Do For Money Honey //

You're workin' in bars, ridin' in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view, on the finest avenue
Lookin' at your beat on the street
You're always pushin', shovin', satisfied with nothing
You bitch, you must be gettin' old

So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder

Honey, what do you do for money?
Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, where do you get your kicks?

You're lovin' on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin' all the blood outta men
Yeah, we're standin' in a queue
Just to spend the night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin', trying get it back in
But girl, you must be gettin' slow

So, stop your love on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder

Honey, what do you do for money?
Oh, honey, what do you do for money?

What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your kicks?
What do you do for money honey?
How do you get your licks?
Go!

Honey, what do you do for money?
I said, honey, what do you do for money?
Oh yeah
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?) What you gotta do?
(Honey) Oh yeah, honey
(What do you do for money?)
What you gonna do?
Ah, what you gotta do?

Down, down to ninety degrees

// Let Me Put My Love Into You //

Flying on a free flight
Driving all night with my machinery
'Cause I, I got the power, any hour
To show the man in me

And those reputations, blown to pieces
With my artillery
I'll be guiding, we'll be riding
Give a-what you got to me

Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight

Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife, oh

Oh, like a fever, burnin' faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling
They got me raisin' steam

Now, don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry
'Cause it's your turn tonight, yeah

Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife, oh
Cut it

Let me
Let me
Ow

Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Oh, let me put my love into you, babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you, babe
Let me give it all
Let me give it all to you
To you
Give it all

// Back In Black //

Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey yeah
Ooh, yeah

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back, back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

I've hit the sack

// Have A Drink On Me //

Whiskey, gin and brandy
With a glass, I'm pretty handy
I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine

So, join me for a drink, boys
We're gonna make a big noise
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

I'm dizzy, drunk and fighting
On tequila, white lightnin'
Yes, my glass is gettin' shorter
On whiskey, ice and water

Yeah, so come on, have a good time
And get blinded out of your mind
So, don't worry about tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the check, we'll get hell to pay

Have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Yeah, have a drink on me
Have a drink on me tonight
Get stoned

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Come on

Going another round
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swig
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
Come on, all the boys make a noise

Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)
Ah, have a drink on me (Have a drink on me)

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

// Shake A Leg //

Idle juvenile on the street, on the street
Ooh, he's kickin' everything with his feet, with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law, yeah

Don't kick, don't fight, don't sleep at night
And shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it up, yeah!

Keepin' out of trouble, with eyes in the back of my face
Kickin' ass in the class and they tell me I'm a damn disgrace
They tell me what they think, but they stink and I really don't care
Got a mind of my own, move on, get out of my hair

Oh, shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg, yow

Magazines, wet dreams, dirty women on machines for me
Big licks, skin flicks, tricky dicks are my chemistry
Goin' against the grain, tryin' to keep me sane with you
So, stop your grinnin', and drop your linen for me

Oh, shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg, yeah
Shake it!
Come on!
Yeah, yow

Kickin' everything with his feet, with his feet, yeah
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law, of the law, yeah
Spittin' and bitin' and kickin' and fightin' for more

Shake a leg, shake your head
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg, play to win
Shake a leg, shut your hand
Shake a leg, wake the dead
Shake a leg, get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it, ow!

// Rock 'N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution //

Alright
Hey there, all you middle men
Throw away your fancy clothes
And while you're out there, sittin' on the fence
So, get off your ass and come down here
'Cause rock and roll ain't no riddle, man
To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, just go
Ow
Ooh, yes

Heavy decibels are playing on my guitar
We got vibrations comin' up from the floor

We're just listenin' to the rockers givin' too much noise
Are you deaf, you wanna hear some more?

We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll, it will survive
Yes it will, ha ha

I took a look inside your bedroom door
You looked so good lyin' on your bed
Well, I asked you if you wanted any rhythm and love
You said you wanna rock and roll, instead

We're just talking about the future
Forget about the past
It'll always be with us
It's never gonna die
Never gonna die

Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll is just rock and roll

Rock and roll ain't noise pollution
Rock and roll ain't gonna die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and rollin' will survive
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll it'll never die
Rock and roll ain't no pollution
Rock and roll
Ah, rock and roll
Is just rock and roll, yeah
