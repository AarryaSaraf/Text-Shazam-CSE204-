Album: HighwayToHell

// Highway To Hell //

Living easy, lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan, payin' my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey mama, look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land
Woo!

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me
Heh, heh!

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell) Highway to hell
(Highway to hell)

And I'm going down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell

// Girls Got Rhythm //

I've been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady, she's got
She's stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a-walking down the street

Wearing dresses so tight
And looking dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
Ow!

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfy me
Love me 'till I'm limbless
Aching and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the Third World War

You know I'm losing sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm
Ow!

You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it, can't live without it

The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

You know she really got the rhythm (Girl's got rhythm)
She's got the backseat rhythm (Backseat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (Rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girl's got rhythm

// Walk All Over You //

Out of my way, I'm a-running high
Take a chance with me and a-give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world don't know
'Cause I ain't looking for overflow
Oh baby, I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels, let down your hair

Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And, there, you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising, falling like the sea

You're looking so good, under me

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, to you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

Moanin', groanin', stirrin' it up
So, gimme the stage, I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light

Tonight is gonna be that night

I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you
(Walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to, baby
(Walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you

// Touch Too Much //

It was one of those nights
When you turn off the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Like a thunder and lightning storm

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's going to drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch too much

Touch me!

Seems like a touch (Touch too much)
You know it's much too much (Much too much)
I really want to feel, yeah (Touch too much)
Girl, you know you're giving me (Much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much, too much, too much

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Givin' me a touch, a touch too much
Lay me down and touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
Touch
Come on, touch me
Yeah!

// Beating Around The Bush //

Smiling face and loving eyes
But you keep on telling me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe?
Honey, I ain't that naive
Baby, I've got my eye on you
'Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your crying and dry your tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears

And you can throw me lefts
And you can throw me rights
But where was you last night?
Beatin' around the bush

Wish I knew what's on your mind
And why you're being so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talking on the telephone?
Thoughts of you go through my brain
Told me that you felt the same
Don't say that you love me too
Tell me who would lie with you?

I was talking birds
And you was talking bees
Or was he down upon his knees?
Beatin' around the bush

You're the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're looking for
You've eaten your cake, you want some more
I'm gonna give you just a one more chance
Try to save our romance
Done everything I'm going to do
The rest is up to you

And you can chew it up
And you can spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush

Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beatin' around the bush

// Shot Down In Flames //

Woo!
One, two

Out on the town, looking for a woman
Gonna give me good love
Anybody want to hang out with me?
And give me plenty of
She was standing alone over by the jukebox
Like she's something to sell
I said, "Baby what's the going price?"
She told me to go to hell

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

Singles bar, got my eye on a honey
Hanging out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said, "Baby, you're driving me crazy"
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
"Toss off, buddy, she's mine"

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame, yeah
To be shot down in flames?

Hey you, Angus, shoot me, shoot!
That's nice, whoa!

Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

Shot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames?

I don't need the pain
Don't want to be shot down in flames
Oh

// Get It Hot //

Going out on the town
Just a me and you
Going to have ourselves a party
Just like we used to do

Nobody's playing Manilow
Nobody's playing soul
And no one's playing hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll

Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Movin' 'round the motorway
Got a whole lotta booze
Got myself a sweet little number
Who's got nothing to lose
(Ha-ha)

Gonna bend you like a G string
Conduct you like a choir
So get your body in the right place
We'll set the world on fire

Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Get it hot
Oh, get it hot
All you can get
Get it hot
Come on baby, get it hot
Make me feel good, get it hot
Oh, baby
Get it hot
Right now

// If You Want Blood (You Got It) //

It's criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothing for nothing
Tell me, who can you trust?
We got what you want
And you've got the lust

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets, blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter, every last drop
You want blood, you got it
Yes, you have

It's animal
Living in a human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feeling like a Christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets, blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter, every last drop
You want blood, you got it
O positive!

Blood on the rocks, blood on the streets
Blood in the sky, blood on the sheets
If you want blood, you've got it!

I want you to bleed for me

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

// Love Hungry Man //

Ah, you're the one I've waited for

I don't know what your game is

Animal appetite

// Night Prowler //

Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
'Cause no one's going to warn you
And no one's going to yell, "Attack!"
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hanging out your back

I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

Too scared to turn your light out
'Cause there's something on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window?
What's that shadow on the blind?
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation
As I slip into your room

I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

I'm your night prowler (I sleep in the day)
I'm your night prowler (get out of my way)
Yeah, I'm the night prowler (watch you tonight)
Yes, I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

I'm your night prowler (break down your door)
I'm your night prowler (crawlin' 'cross your floor)
I'm the night prowler (make a mess of you) Yes, I will
Night prowler
And I'm tellin' this to you
There ain't nothin', there ain't nothin'
Nothin' you can do

"Shazbot, nanu nanu"
