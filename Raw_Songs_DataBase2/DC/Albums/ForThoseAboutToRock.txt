Ooh, yeah

My hand's all out of control
Yes, and I can't stop it getting down on you
It's moving on it's own accord

Radiating off to you

It's knocking on your door
And you know what it's for

I put the finger right on you

You put your finger on me too
Then I put the finger, I put the finger

It's a key to unlocking your door
Don't you know I've broken through your security?
My hands ain't tied no more

Sticking up for your pleasure
You can feel it on your ankle, feel it on your knee
Feel it on your thigh, can you feel me?

You put your finger on me too
Then I put the finger, I put the finger

// Let's Get It Up //

My, my, my

Loose lips sink ships
So come aboard for a pleasure trip
It's high tide, so let's ride
The moon is rising and so am I

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up
Cruisin' on the seven seas
A pirate of my loving needs
I'll never go down, never go down

So let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it right up
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

Loose wires cause fires
Getting tangled in my desires
So screw him up and plug him in
Then switch it on and start all over again

I'm gonna get it up
Never gonna let it up, no
Ticking like a time bomb, ooh, yeah
Blowing out the fuse box
I'll never go down, never go down

So let's get it up
Let's get it up, get it up, oh, oh
Let's get it up, right to the top
Let's get it up, right now

Get it up

// Inject The Venom //

No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
Ooh, no mercy from me

Tell no truth and tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
Oh, inject your venom, it'll be your last attack, ow

Oh, no mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
V-E-N-O-M

Got no heart, no, feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain, yeah
Come choose your victim, take him by surprise
Go in hard and get him right between the eyes

And inject the venom (Ow)

Inject the venom (C'mon)
Inject it all (Ow)

// Snowballed //

Crashed out of the market, out on the floor
Washed up on the shore
Bombed out of the city, out of the door
Blown up against the wall
Put out of the picture, axe about to fall
Walk before you crawl
Dragged down to the bottom, screaming for air
The shark must get his share

You could see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are gonna make you pay

Snowballed, ooh yeah
Snowballed, they done it again
Snowballed, making me blind
Snowballed

The howl of the wolf, snow in his eye
Waiting to take you by surprise
Eye of the needle, heat of the fight
Watch those teeth 'cause they're ready to bite

You can see it coming
Miles and miles away
Women, drink and money
Are gonna make you pay

You've been snowballed, yes, you have
Snowballed, I've been fooled again
Snowballed, that's all
Snowballed
Out of my mind

Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed
Snowballed
You've been snowballed
Snowballed
You've been snow
You've been snow
Snow
Ball, ball, balled

// Evil Walks //

Black shadow hanging over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison running through your veins

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

Black widow weaving evil notion
Dark secrets being spun in your web
Good men going down in your ocean
They can't swim 'cause they're tied to your bed

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

You just cry wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom, haha
Oh, black widow

Come on, weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got him tied to your bed
With your dark, dark secrets
And your green, green eyes
You black widow

Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks around you
Evil walks behind you

Evil sleeps beside you (Evil talks)
Evil talks around you (Yeah, evil walks)
Evil walks behind you
Evil walks
You're so bad

// C.O.D. //

Call of a dog, cry of a bitch
The cream of a dream is the cause of the itch
Call on the doctor, cash on demand
If I get enough rope, might even hang

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
Care of the devil in me

The curse of love is the cause of the pain
The crime of the day is when you do it again
Call on the doctor, cash on demand
If you give them a finger, they'll take off your hand

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
Down to the devil with me

Call of the dog, cry of a bitch
The sign of a sinner's the size of his itch

C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., oh
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., the devil in me
C.O.D., care of the devil
C.O.D., oh, care of the devil in me

I'm paying, paying
I'm paying C.O.D
Care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
It's the curse of love

// Breaking The Rules //

Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
Street jungle in the tough-child 'hoods
Examinations done no good
Ghetto bars and hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion, not today

I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule

Tough breaks in the neighborhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Living like trash, a society rash
Ready to break, and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
And doing time on the other side
No rebellion, not today

I get my kicks in my own way
Right, okay

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Tough breaks

They got regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With their regulation rules

Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready to rule
Just keep on breaking the rules (Breaking the rules)
Get ready
Just keep on breaking the rules
Come on, get ready, get ready, get ready
Ready to rule

Oh, take off your ties
And your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools, yeah
And your damn regulation rules
I'm gonna do things my own way
Every day, every day, every day in every way
I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules

// Night Of The Long Knives //

Oh

Who's your leader? Who's your man?
Who will help you fill your hand?
Who's your friend and who's your foe?
Who's your Judas? You don't know

Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife

Oh, where's that savior? Where's that light
When you're praying for your life?
Who's that fighting back to back?
Who's defending whose attack?

Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long, long knife
Night of the long knife
Oh, stab him in the back once

It's the night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives

It's the night
Of the long, long knife
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh
It's night of the, night of the
Night of the long, long knife

// Spellbound //

Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash

I can do nothing right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
Oh, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' 'round and 'round

Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down

Bleedin' by a blind bend
Wrong way up a dead end
Screamin' through a speed trap
As I tear into a tailback

You know
I can do nothing right
No, I, I never sleep at night
And I can't even start a fight
Well, my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' 'round and 'round

Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Yeah, keeps a-tumbling down

Come on, slide
I'm slipping down

I got my hands in the fire

Ooh, I'm sliding on an oil slick
Burnin' on a bad trip
Yes, and nothing's gonna change it

No, I can do nothing right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinnin' 'round and 'round

Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
No, no
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down, yeah
Spellbound
My world keeps a-tumbling down
