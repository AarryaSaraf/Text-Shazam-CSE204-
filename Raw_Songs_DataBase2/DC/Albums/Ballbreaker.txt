Album: Ballbreaker

// Hard As A Rock //

A rolling rock, electric shocks
She gives a lickin' that don't stop
She light 'em up, push you 'round
Smokin' rings goin' 'round and 'round

Her hot potatoes
Will elevate you
Her bad behavior
Will leave you standin' proud
An' hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

The lightnin' rod strike it hot
It's gonna hit you like the Rushmore rock
No nicotine and no pipe dreams
So low and dirty, it's down right mean

Hell elevator
Yeah, I'll see you later
No, I ain't going to take it
Yes, I'm
I'm busting out
I'm hard as a rock

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

Hard as a rock
Harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Yeah

I'm gettin' harder

Harder than a rock

Well, I'm harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Babe, I'm harder than a rock, yeah

Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock
Hard as a rock
Well, it's harder than a rock

// Cover You In Oil //

I like to slip into something good
I see a young girl in the neighborhood
The way she move, I must confess
I'd like to run my hands up and down her legs
The way she dress, she look so fine

It's nothing for the show, I just pay to see her go
She make you hot, you spray your lot
So, come on in, honey, we're heading to the top
The way she push, she don't give a dime
Abuse your life, gonna make you satisfied
She's kinda rough, she give it tough

// The Furor //

Hey, what's the furor?

Kick the dust, wipe the crime from the main street
Await the coming of The Lord
Hanging 'round with them low down and dirties
Bringing order from the boss
What's the furor 'bout it all?
Leave you panting, bust your balls
Kicked around, messed about, get your hands dirty
On the killing floor

I'm your furor
I'm your furor, baby
Come on, yeah

Frame of mind, cross the line to a new state
I can shake the law
Friend of mine gonna build me a new place
Not knocking door-to-door

I'm your furor
I'm your furor, baby
What's your furor?
I'm your furor, baby

Bring on the furor
C'mon

Well, I'm your furor
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
I'm your furor, baby
I'm your furor
What's your furor, baby?
Feel the furor
You're my furor

I'm your furor
I'm your furor

// Boogie Man //

Some people say I'm only out at night
Maybe those folks might've got it right
And some people say I drive a Cadillac car
Or sell my wares haunting hotel bars

I'm the boogie man
Yeah
The boogie man
Yeah, yeah-yeah

I like fine suits, smoke the best cigars
Like talking sex to women, girls, in fast cars
I might be under the bed, ready to bite
So, little girl, be careful when you're on your own, tonight
'Cause I'm your boogie man
Your boogie man

And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man

I'm your boogie man
I'm the boogie man
Yes, I'm the boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Ow, here we go

And I hope that you don't misunderstand
Your boogie man
And don't let the sun come up on me
Your boogie man

I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, the boogie man
I'm your boogie man, boogie man
Boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Yeah-yeah
I'm your boogie man
I'm your boogie man
Boogie man

// The Honey Roll //

Honey, roll over, and lettuce on top
Strap you to the bed and make you rock
Run it up the flag, send it on home
Push you to the wall, an' make you moan

She's mine, take what I want
Get what I need, don't take it all
So, don't you hide, I'm gonna blow my mind
Come on, taste it, honey, 'cause she feel fine

She turn it on
Upside down
She turn me on
Inside out
She turn it on
All around
She turn me on
She turn it on

Honey, bend over, touch your toes
She take over, the bomb explodes
A rocking roller-coaster, flying over top
Take you high diving, off a long drop
Yeah

Get what I need, don't take it all
Don't you hide, I wanna blow my mind
Come on, taste it, honey, 'cause she feel fine

// Burnin' Alive //

Burnin' alive
Set my soul on fire
Running with a gun
This place is gonna burn

No fire-water, or Novocain
No thunderstorm, no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So, watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn

Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive
Burnin' alive

They be smokin' your hide, come runnin' wild
Tell you, "Nothing to fear, 'cause the buck stops here"
He came from a little town called Hope
And someday, maybe, it'll go up in smoke
I said

No fire-water, or Novocain
No thunderstorm and no John Wayne
No kids to rock, nowhere to run
So, watch out, 'cause this place is gonna burn

Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all-out war
An all-out war
Burnin' alive
Burnin' alive

Somewhere, there's a little town called Hope
And someday, maybe, baby
He'll inhale that smoke
(Ha-ha)

Yeah, we're burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive
It's an all-out war
An all-out war
Hear the battle roar
It's an all-out war
Yeah, we're burnin' alive, burnin' alive
Burnin' alive, burnin' alive

Yeah
Watch the place burn down

// Hail Caesar //

He be the count of Monte Cristo
Could be a quake any day
Maybe somebody from Siam
Begin the era of a new Reich

Keeps licking all the honey
Chewing up the fat he rakes
Instead of sending to the lions
They cover him with praise

All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

Down at the epicenter, things started heatin' up
Rocking up the Richter scale
Swinging in the chariot, around and around, we go
The senators rehearse the tale

Starring in the Coliseum
Tied upon the rack
Up, comes the thumb of Caesar
To stab you in the back

All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

Down at the epicenter, things started heatin' up
Rocking on the Richter scale
Swingin' in the chariot, around and around, we go
As the senators rehearse the tale
Watch out, Caesar
Watch out, Caesar
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"
I said, "Hail"

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!
All hail Caesar
Hail! Hail!

You need eyes in the back of your head, boy
Or you're dead

// Love Bomb //

Love bomb, love bomber
It's a-comin' on strong
I can't take it any longer
Come a-rockin' through your door

Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays, get ready, it's bombs away

Love bomb, love bomber
Don't scare, no bother
Where the size doesn't matter
Come long, short or batter

Cruisin' the sky, let's fly
Blowin' all night and day
Open your bays and drop those bombs away

Love bomb, comin' on
Love bomb
Love bomb, get it hard
Love bomb

Love bomb, get it on
Love bomb, gettin' stoned
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah-yeah, yow
Love bomb, I'm comin' on
Love bomb, I'm gettin' stoned
Love bomb, get it hot
Love bomb, yeah
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber
Love bomb, love bomber

// Caught With Your Pants Down //

Runnin' 'round with the wrong crowd
Goin' out on a last stand
Playin' too hard an' too loud
Bad cards in a bad hand
Wanna dance, wanna sing
Whip you with that lickin' thing

Tonight, I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down

Lining up for a roll call
Goin' out with a big bang
Gettin' caught in a shootout
Take it hard like a big man
Women workin' so hot
Givin' it everything you got
Just like it's never gonna stop

Ooh, tonight, I'm gonna kick up
Out drivin' in a big truck
An' maybe I'll get beat up
Caught with your pants down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down

Yeah, yeah, yeah
She take 'em down, down, down
Though she rip off her stockings when the place start rockin'
(Down, down, down)
She was a woman with a mission, stick it in your face

Caught with your pants down
Down, down, down, down, down

Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down
Caught with your pants down

Beggin' with your pants down
Got you with your pants down
I'm humping with my pants down
Caught you with you pants down
Everybody talking 'bout you (pants down)
Sneakin' in the alley with your (pants down)
Breakin' in her room to get your (pants down)

// Whiskey On The Rocks //

Ooh
I've been drinking all night long
So long, baby, I'm gone

Ooh, yeah
Well, Bloody Mary give me shiver from a shot
Set up the shooters, it's time for a drop
Gimme Old Jamaica, running we come
Down at the hatch, Jack, the women and the fun

We drink a lot
That demon drop
This one's on me and here's to you

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

You went drinking Mai Tais, Singapore sling
Beam me up, Jim, it's time to come in
I'll have one more a-fore ya close up the door
It's on the house, Mac, it's whiskey galore

We drink a lot of that demon drop
This one's on me, here's mud in your eye

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

He's gone seven sheets to the wind
(Ha-ha-ha)
Fill him up, Joe!

Lock the door

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

Whiskey on the rocks
A double or a shot
Whiskey on the rocks
Elixir from the top

I'm drinkin'
Whiskey on the rocks
I'll have my whiskey on the rocks
Gimme whiskey on the rocks
Keep it comin' on the rocks
Yeah
Pour me a double, here come trouble (Whiskey on the rocks)
Whiskey on the rocks

// Ballbreaker //

Breakin' balls, bangin' walls
Work hard and tough, and I want some rough
Unpack my bags, and take a drag
When bang on nine, and I'm dead on time

Open up the door
And lay upon the floor
She open her overcoat
Living out her dreams
Rippin' off my jeans

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

Engine roll, and time to go
At razorback, a hog attack
I'm building steam, for whipping cream
She likes a fat smoking stack

Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
"Honey, shoot your load"

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

Ballbreaker

Wrecking ball, let it roll
You are a Ballbreaker
Building steam, for whipping cream
You are a Ballbreaker

Hanging off her legs
She threw me on the bed
Her hand went for my throat
As I began to choke
"Honey, shoot your load"

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker

You are a Ballbreaker
Ballbreaker
