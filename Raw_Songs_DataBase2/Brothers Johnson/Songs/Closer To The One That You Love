You get to me, fine lady
Understand my love
When we meet I'm ready
You turn me on so long
I choose you
Forever and a day
Ain't no other woman
Can make me feel the way
I do
Been losing sleep over you
Girl, when you're next to me
The sun comes shining through

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love

I've seen those gaming ladies
I don't understand
In their eyes I see it
There's that master plan
I can't use it. I'll never have the time
Looking through it
Truth of it is a kind
I need
The only dream that's for me
'Cause I was kicking around
Until you hit me with your smile

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love
