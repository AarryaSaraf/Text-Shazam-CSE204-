My love, my only
You can't imagine how you make me feel inside
For you have opened all doors
To you my heart can't hide
Oh, baby, my only
Say you love me and you'll never leave me lonely

I'll never leave you lonely, girl
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

My love, my only
I know the two of us were hurt by love before
But now, girl, we're together
Let's love each other more
Oh, baby, my only
Say you love me and I'll never leave you lonely

I'll never leave you lonely, girl
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

Alright, okay
I'll never leave you lonely
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

I'll never leave you lonely
I'll never leave you lonely

Oh, Lord
I'll never leave you lonely
Okay
I'll never leave you lonely, girl

Funk on, funk on
Alright, alright
I'll never leave you lonely
Okay
I'll never leave you lonely...
