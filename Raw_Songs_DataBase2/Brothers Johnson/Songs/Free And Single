Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

I'm a man full of fun
I can't stop, must book, I gotta run
'Cause there's things I got to do
I can't do 'em all staying with you

Now if you want me, you got to get me
But I promise you that you'll miss me
I know you can't hold on
'Cause this bull is much to strong

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

I got to keep movin' around
I can't let nothing tie me down
'Cause once you've got a love jones
You've got to be at home jones

There's no way that I can do it
I can't seem to satisfy you
If you want me all the time, girl
I can't promise I'll be true

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

There's people I got to see
I got to move along to be me
You can't stop the rainin'
You can't mend a heart when it's painin'

So I'd rather not be
What you want to see
I don't want to see you cry
When I give someone else a try

Free and single
Free and single
Free and single
Free and single

There's no way that I can do it
Free and single
I can't seem to satisfy you
Free and single
If you want me all the time, girl
Free and single
I can't promise I'll be true, yeah
Free and single
I can't promise I'll be true

I might change
I might change
Rearrange on you

I said, I might change
I might change
Rearrange, like I always do

I might keep you one day
The next, I won't have ya
I might keep you one day
The next day, I'll have me a new one

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh, come on

Well, it's the way I am
And the way I'll be
If you want to stay
Come on and see me

But I might change
I might change, tell me
I might change or rearrange

I might change your brain
I might change your brain
I might change your brain
Or rearrange all your marbles, hey
Well

Ah, one day, it might be you
The next day, I might have two...
