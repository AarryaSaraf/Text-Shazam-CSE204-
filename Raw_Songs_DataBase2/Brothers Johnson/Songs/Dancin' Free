I want to dance
Dance with you
I want to dance
(Dancin' free tonight)

I want to dance
Dance with you
I want to dance
(Dancin' free tonight)

So take her arms and swing her around
It's a party
(Dancin' free tonight)

It's your time, so don't mess around
Go on and do it
(Dancin' free tonight)

All I need is my dancin' partner
(Dancin' free tonight)
So let's take a chance, we got to dance
To the music

Dancin' free tonight
Every night of the night

Even deejays can't stop replays
Movin', groovin'
(Dancin' free tonight)

Girls everywhere givin' you that dancin' stare (I want to dance with you)
(Dancin' free tonight)

Fever's touched everyone in the world
(Dancin' free tonight)
So all you guys get up and get you a girl
(Dancin' free tonight)

Dancin' free tonight
Every night of the night
