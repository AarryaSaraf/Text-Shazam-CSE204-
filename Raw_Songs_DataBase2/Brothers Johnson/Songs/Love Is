I love you, all in all
'Cause love is just my way
To say I need you every day

Your love is, after all
A special kind of touch
That turns me on so much
I can't help myself

I love you, all in all
'Cause you've been good to me
And every day, girl, we get closer

Love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

I love you, all in all
'Cause love is just my way
To say I need you every day

I love you, all in all
'Cause I have never known a love
That I could really call my own

Say love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

Love
Love is, love is
Love
Love is, love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is

Love can make you see
Differently, but clear
All the things you've waited for
Will suddenly appear
Love can make you feel
Really, really real
Love is...
