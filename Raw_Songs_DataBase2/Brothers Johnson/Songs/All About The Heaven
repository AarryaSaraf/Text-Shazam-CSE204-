Feelings you've never felt before
Could be you're dreaming
But you don't know sure
What is this feeling leading to

Long nights of staring at the walls
Until the dawn light, can't get no sleep at all
There's only one thing you can do
Get on the phone to try and talk it through

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That realizing you need someone to love
Yes it's all, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

Those blue days
It never seems to matter what you do days
'Cause nothing's going right
The sun just seems to pass you by

And heartaches that linger on and on
Until your heart makes you see that something's wrong
And then you start to wonder why
And see what you've been missing in your life

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That realizing that you need someone to love
Yes it's all, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

So hold me tight
And prove to me that this thing ain't over tonight
Go love me right
So we can face the morning with the magic of tonight

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That finding out you're needing someone to love
All, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

All, all about the heaven
Feels so right, and I want you all night

All, all about the heaven
I can't let go, I just want you to know
