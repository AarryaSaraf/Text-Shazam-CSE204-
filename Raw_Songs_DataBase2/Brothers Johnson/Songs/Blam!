Well well well well
Well well well well, hey
I'm gon' get cha', yeah

You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking

Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now

I know just what I like
And I like what I see

Push done come to shove
Now I'm begging for your love
Have some mercy

BLAM!
Get up off that stuff
Baby don't you wanna
Get up off that stuff
Get up off that stuff

Your sexy ways are all I see
You stir up all my energy
Girl I'm ready
I can hear your body talk
You're the prey I want to stalk
Foxy lady

Girl, I could please you
If I had you right now
Girl I could squeeze you
If I had you right now

Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now

You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking

BLAM!
Get up off that stuff
Baby don't you wanna
Get up off that stuff
Get up off that stuff
Baby don't you wanna
Get up off that stuff

Get up off that stuff
Get up off that stuff
