In my life, I've learned to take my falls
Pick 'em up, turn 'em around and look at 'em all
It seems all my time's spent on these worthless things
I can't find the time to enjoy the good life brings

And then you walk right in my life so beautifully
And there is no one else I'd rather see

I want you, I want you in my heart
I want you, I needed you from the start
I want you, I need you every day
I want you, I'll take you any way

All the things in life may be around
They cost a pretty penny, so I found
There ain't nothing in this world as good as you
So now I choose, I want to be with you

So let me love you with all my heart and all my soul
Just being near you, I have no control
So let me touch you, let me love you always
'Cause you're the reason why I just got to say
I love you and I need you now

All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
All the things in life may be around
Cost a pretty penny, so I found
You are my desire every day
In my heart is where you will stay
