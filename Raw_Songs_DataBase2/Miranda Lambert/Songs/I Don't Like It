Yeah, I love it when you wake me up
And kiss me till the coffee's cold
I love it when you make your plans
About how we're gonna both grow old
I love it when you laugh real hard
I love to hold you when you cry
I love it when you get so high
Fly around like a firefly

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

Hey, I love it when you say my name
I love it when you sing a song
I always love to sing along
I always get the words all wrong

Yeah, I love it when you say let's go
To somewhere we've never been
I love you 'cause you love me back
I love you, you're my friend

But I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here
