For the stranger drinking anger on the rocks at the end of the bar
For the Carolines sipping their wine hoping this is where the good ones are
For the lovers making out in a corner booth
For the one over there, don't think I didn't notice you

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

For the belt buckle shiner, she's starting all the fires in her Levi jeans
For the one who doesn't come here anymore 'cause he's getting over me
For the one stirring up her emotions in the ice with her fingertips
She showed up with somebody but that ain't who she's leaving with

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

For my old dive bar with the hand drawn heart. hanging lonely on the bathroom door
For the old dance hall with the mirror ball throwing starlight on the floor

That's what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There's a song you can lean on
That's what makes the jukebox play
When the night won't end
'Cause it plays over and over and over again

It plays over and over and over
