No bartenders
No guitars with B-Benders
No two-steppin' shuffles
No shiny belt buckles
No sawdust in sight
No cold Lone Star Light
Well, they've mopped all the floors
Locked all the doors
And turned out the lights

Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks
And now my world ain't turning
The jukebox ran out of change
And the neon lights ain't buzzing
There ain't nothin' sadder
Than covering Haggard
And nobody singing along
Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks

There's no Broken Spoke
Dim lights or thick smoke
No more rowdy and reckless
No more Billy Bob's Texas
No barstool backsliding
No Gilley's bull riding
No more last call
No boots in Gruene Hall
Damn, that ain't right

They've closed down the honky tonks
And now my world ain't turning
The jukebox ran out of change
And the neon lights ain't buzzing
There ain't nothin' sadder
Than covering Haggard
And nobody singing along
Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks

Y'all they've closed down the honky tonks
