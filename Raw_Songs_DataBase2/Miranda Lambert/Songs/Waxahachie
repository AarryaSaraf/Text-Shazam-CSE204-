Nobody ever left New Orleans as mad as I was
I wrote a lipstick letter on the mirror with a bourbon buzz
You were right, it got about as bad as it gets
I'm not lookin' for a turnaround tempo on the rubble strips

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
I can be there by 4 a.m.
Lookin' for a long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie

If I could just get down the road a beat
It won't be that hard
I can run from the demons like the devil in a speedin' car
I've got enough gasoline, memories and nicotine
Freedom's overrated, guess I underestimated the truth
And you

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
I can be there by 4 a.m.
Lookin' for a long-lost friend
That's what you've always been
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie

Waxahachie
Are you still on 35?
Are you still an all-night drive
From Louisiana?
Waxahachie
It's comin' on 4 a.m.
I need to be in your arms again
Lookin' for my long-lost friend
Waxahachie
Ooh
Waxahachie
