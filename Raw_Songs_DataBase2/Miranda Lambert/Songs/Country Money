Connie Johnson got a farm in Wisconsin
And a diesel in the drive and her air horn's honking
Got a pocket full of Benji's and her new Luccheses
And the best beef in the cheese state, baby

Carol Jean, she's the chicken egg queen
Yeah, she started with a dozen, now she's living the dream
She's a bad mother clucker with a house on the hill
Rides her hens around town in a Coup de Ville

Making country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Making that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B

Carter Sisters got the good corn liquor
Get the one with the peaches, it'll get you there quicker
Guess their moonshine mama taught 'em the deal
'Cause there's gold dripping out of that still

They're making that country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Making that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B

Making it rain on the cornfield
Raking it in with the windmill
While the combine's kicking up nickels right out of the dirt

Making that country money
Making that country money
Down in Cash Cow County where the bills really grow on trees
Spending that country money
Dripping like local honey
You can't tell by her britches, but she's one rich S.O.B
