They're sellin' snake oil from the pulpit
At the church on Main
They're makin' deals with the devil
In the good Lord's name

I'm stuck at home missing a dirty soul cleansing
Ain't got a dime for the tithe
I believe amusing personal communion
Can lead you right to the light

Give me some of that holy water
A bit of that holy water
Just a nip on that holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown

They're pushin' concrete at the courthouse
Whether you like it or not
So tell the bank man to cash your pay-check
So you can piss in a pot

I'm stuck at home wishin' I could just go fishin'
And throw some bait on the line
You can't skip a stone where the rivers all but gone
And there ain't even a cloud in the sky

Give me some of that holy water
Just a bit of that holy water
A nip of that holy water
Holy water's gonna make us drown

Take us down

I need a sip of that holy water
Just a bit of that holy water
Just a nip of that holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown

I want hit of that holy water
A sip of that holy water
Get a grip of that holy water
Gonna drink it till we finally drown

I'm gonna drink it till I finally drown

It's gonna take us down
Ho-ho-ho-oh, holy water
Holy water gonna make us drown
