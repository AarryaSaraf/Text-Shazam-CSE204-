I could see you coming all the way from Amarillo
Truck stop red lips pullin' on some nicotine
Shining like the spokes on a brand new El Dorado
You're trailer park pretty, but you're never gonna be Jolene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you gotta make memean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You get 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

If I was a man I'd make you my Dallas Alice
I'd put a leftover pawn shop ring on your left hand
You're never gonna be the backstage babe at the Crystal Palace
You're too late baby, I'm the only bitch in the band

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you got to be so mean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You got 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Why you got to be so mean
Don't make me cause a scene now, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
You got 'em all on their knees
But you can't take a man from me
Geraldene

Geraldene, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
Geraldene, Geraldene
