I'm finally on the up and up
A little 401K
Traded in my trailer park
For a neighborhood with a gate
Queen finally got her castle
Last one on the right, you can't miss it
Upgraded from the barbed wire
Now I got a nice picket

I can play high class all day
But some things never change

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep it clean on Sundays
And keep the lights and water on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

Carnations from the flowerbed
In a whiskey bottle vase
Cadillac on a cinder block
Duct tape on every other thing
Real ferns in the sunroom
Bug zapper by the screen
Dog hair on the Restoration Hardware
Who says you can't have nice things

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep my roots from showing
But I'm still dishwater blonde
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

New money old habits
Love seat in the plastic
Steak fingers in a basket
New money old habits

I can't hide it in a closet
I can't stuff it in a trunk
I always know there's treasure
Buried somewhere in the junk
I can keep it clean on Sundays
And keep the lights and water on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

Got more rooms than the Joneses
Ya'll and I'm still adding on
But I can't keep my white trash off the lawn

I'm finally on the up and up
I'm finally on the up and up
Up and up, up and up, up and up...
