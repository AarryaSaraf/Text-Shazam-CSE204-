That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
And I'm movin' on

That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama down in Tennessee
So keep me movin' on, keep me rollin' along
Shovel the coal, let this rattle a roll
And keep me movin' on

Mister engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep me movin' on, keep me rollin' along
You're gonna ease my mind and put me there on time
And keep me rollin' on

I told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on

You switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For no trifling woman on my main line
'Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
Well I've warned you twice and now you settle the price
And now I'm movin' on

Some day baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
I'm movin' on, you stayed away too long
Well I'm through with you, with your bad and your blues
I'll keep a movin' on
