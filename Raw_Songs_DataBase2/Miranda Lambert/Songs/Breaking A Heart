Everybody's sorry
Everybody's sad
Everybody's losin'
Somethin' that they can't get back
What if I regret it?
Givin' up the fight
It's harder to explain it
When no one's really wrong or right

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart

It's killin' me to do this
I don't really know
How I'm gettin' through this?
I really do wish you were the one lettin' go

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
