Here's to Nowhere Arizona you don't know how bad I owe ya
Didn't know a soul all summer long so my best friends became these songs I write
Stayed up all night

Here's to Mister Leather Jacket told me that I'd never hack it
Every time you did me wrong just put more country in these songs I write
They're gettin' me by

So I'd do it all again
Everything I had to lose to win
Cos every time I think my world might end
It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Champion
Champion

Heres' to sacrificing mem'ries things I've missed my best friend's wedding
Night that my nephew was born tears I poured into these songs I write
I've paid a price for this life

And I'd do it all again
Everything I had to lose to win
Cos every time I think my world might end
It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Champion
Champion

To everything that went all wrong
It only put more country in my songs

It's the fall before the climb
Broken heart is always my
Look at where we are tonight
Champion
Champion
Champion
