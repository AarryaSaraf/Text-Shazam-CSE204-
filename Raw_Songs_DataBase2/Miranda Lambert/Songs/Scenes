I met a trucker named Dwayne south of the 10
Got a gin and juice at the Satellite Inn
I was gettin' loose, making new friends
Anything to forget about you

Then I moved on to the KOA
Met an old hippie named Katie with a K
Went skinny dipping in Havasu Lake
Anything to forget about you

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

I hit the badlands fast I was zig zag rollin'
High on a Harley didn't care where I was going
Said "call me the Queen of South Dakota"
Anything to forget about you

Took my time on the way down to Reno
Jumped in the back of a black El Camino
Won fun money at the Gold Casino
Anything to forget about you

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

Another Fleetwood dream
Another sunset scheme
Another turn a new leaf
Movin' right along to the next scene
Another motel room
Another crescent moon
Between me and you
Movin' right along to the next scene

Santa Monica coaster
Put me on a poster
That's all she wrote, sir
Movin' right along to the next scene
