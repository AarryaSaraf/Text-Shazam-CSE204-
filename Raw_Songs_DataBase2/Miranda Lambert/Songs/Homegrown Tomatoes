Sittin' in the shade, loaded lemonade, watching the hummingbirds
Humming me a tune all afternoon, best song I've never heard
Texas sky and big blue eyes staring over aviators
Got a big boom box, Bulleit on the rocks, homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Brisket on cooking low and long smoking up the neighborhood
If we do it right we can go all night like Emmy and Dollywood
If you ain't in it for fun tonight, it's see ya later alligator
We're US prime, weed and wine, homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Homegrown tomatoes
Homegrown tomatoes
Homegrown tomatoes
