Should I give up sunsets
For marigold mornings?
Should I look for rainbows
Or wait for the rain?
Is happiness on the highway
Or is it parked in the driveway?
Should I lean on you, babe
Or should you lean on me?

Am I looking for comfort?
Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you?
Am I looking the other way?

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?
Am I settling up
Or settling down?

I could plant a pretty garden
Or just send myself flowers
Be a jet set Friday
Or a Sunday hometown girl
I could stay a little lonely
Or let you get to know me
Yeah, I could love a picket fence
If it wrapped around the world

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
I'm one heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?

Am I looking for comfort?
Am I looking for an escape?
Am I looking for you?
Am I looking the other way?

I'm a little wild child and a homing pigeon
Caravan and an empty kitchen
Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds
One heart going both directions
One love and a couple of questions
Am I settling up
Or settling down?
Am I settling up
Or settling down?
