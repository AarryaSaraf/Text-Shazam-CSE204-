I must have been through about a million girls
I'd love 'em and I'd leave 'em alone
And I didn't care how much they cried, no sir
Their tears left me cold as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
Yes I did, yes I did
I fooled around and fell in love
Fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name
Ah, but when the grass got greener on the other side
I'd just tear out that page

But then I fooled around and fell in love
You know I did, I
Fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love

I got to tell ya
Ooh baby, I need ya
Don't make me wait
Ooh baby, I need ya
I fooled around, I fooled around

Free on my own, that's the way I used to be, oh
But since I met you baby, love's got a hold on me

Fooled around and fell in love
It's got a hold on me now
Fooled around and fell in love
I can't let go of you, baby
Fooled around and fell in love
Oh, I can't stop loving you now
Fooled around and fell in love

Hey!
I fooled around, I fooled around, I fooled around
Yes I did, yes I did
I fooled around, I fooled around, and I fell in love
I fooled around, I fooled around
I did it, I did it, I did it
I fooled around and fell in love
Oooh, ohhh
Ahhh
