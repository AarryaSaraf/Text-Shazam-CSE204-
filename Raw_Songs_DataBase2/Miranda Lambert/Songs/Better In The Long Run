Cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
One more down, to drink you off my mind
Lord knows I've tried a thousand times to give you up
But its closing time and we both know why


I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run


We've been driving down this highway
Now we're out of gas, too far outta town
Oh here we are all tangled up and sideways
You're all broken down, yeah I'm breaking down

I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run


Oh maybe somewhere a little down the line
I'll get a little better leaving us behind
Maybe someday, Oh I'll be fine.


Oh and you'll move on and I will too
But still I don't see gettin over you
Oh, no, no, no

I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone (ohh no)
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run

In the long run
Oh in the long run
In the long run
In the long run
