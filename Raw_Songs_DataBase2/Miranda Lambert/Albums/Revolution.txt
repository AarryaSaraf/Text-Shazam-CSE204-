// White Liar //

Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they every found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up anyway
I got friends in this town

Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
'Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out that you don't lie too well

Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out that I've been lying, too

Now I'm the white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of my tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

// Only Prettier //

Well I've been saved by the grace of Southern charm
I got a mouth like a sailor and yours is more like a Hallmark card
And if you wanna pick a fight
Well I'm gonna have to say goodnight
I don't have to be hateful, I can just say bless your heart

And even though I don't belong with your high life friends
It doesn't mean we don't get together and try to make amends
It's easier can't you see
Let's agree to just disagree
We don't have to like each other but it's sure fun to pretend

So let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You've got your friends just like I've got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you
Only prettier

Everybody says you've gotta know your enemies
Even if they only weigh a hundred pounds and stand five foot three
If you just smile and behave you can always get your way
It's a universal plan that'll get you where you can in all societies

So let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You've got your friends just like I've got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you
Only prettier
Hey!

[Break]

So let's shake hands and reach across those party lines
You've got your friends just like I've got mine
We might think a little differently
But we got a lot in common you will see
We're just like you
Only prettier

Well, I'll keep drinkin'
And you'll keep gettin' skinnier
I'm just like you
Only prettier

// Dead Flowers //

I feel like the 
flowers in this vase,
He just brought em' 
home one day,
"Ain't they beautiful"
he said.
They've been here in
the kitchen and the
water's turnin' grey.
They're sittin' in 
the vase but now 
they're dead.
Dead flowers.

I feel like this 
long string of lights.
They lit up our whole
house on christmas day.
But now it's January
and the bulbs have
all burned out,
But still they hang.
Like dead flowers.

He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the 
sting of this rain. 
I'm livin' in a hurricane.
All he can say is, 
"Man ain't it such a nice day"
Yeah, Yeah. 

I feel like the
tires on this car. 
They said we won't go far
but we're still rollin'
I look in the rear view
and I see dead flowers in the yard
and that string of lights.
But and it ain't glowin'
Like dead flowers.
Like dead flowers. 

He ain't feelin' anything
My love, my hurt, or the 
sting of this rain.
I'm drivin' through a hurricane.
All he can say is, 
"Man ain't it such a nice day"
Hey, hey I guess we'll just
go to waste, like dead flowers.

Like dead flowers.
Dead flowers.

// Me And Your Cigarettes //

Gives you something you can do with your hands

Makes you look cool and feel like a man

In the morning you will probably regret me 

Me and your cigarettes 


Started young it's too late to quit

Most call it a bad, bad habit 

Your mama told you, you could end up dead 

With me, me and your cigarettes 


Always there every time you need me 

It ain't love but just like nicotine 

You're addicted to a feeling you can only get 

From me and your cigarettes 


Light us up and then throw us down 

Walk away when we hit the ground 

How they going to feel when you come back around here and see

It's just you and your cigarettes 


Always there every time you need me 

It ain't love but just like nicotine

You're addicted to a feeling you can only get

From me and your cigarettes

// Maintain The Pain //

I put a bullet in my radio 

Something just hit me funny I don't know

Just pulled the trigger going down the road 

You slam the door and knock me off the wire 

Then walk in lines and you been burning tires

Slow and easy ain't that what you like? 


It's insane it's in vain

You stay to maintain the pain 


I hear your name and then it burns a hole

I swear I hate you but I can't let go 

The kind of feelings that you can't console 


It's in all vain it's all insane 

I swear you'll stay 

I swear you'll stay to maintain the pain


It's all in vain it's all insane 

I swear you'll stay

I swear you'll stay to main the pain


Maintain the pain

// Airstream Song //

Sometimes I wish I lived in airstream homemade curtains
Lived just like a gypsy.
Break a heart, roll out of town
Cause gypsies never get tied down

Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream
Instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl

Unbridled, or tethered in tide
the saftey of the fence or the danger of the ride
I'll always be unsatisfied

Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them

Unanchored in a storm
or safety on the shore
If this is all I need
Why do I want more?

Sometimes I wish I lived in airstream homemade curtains
lived just like a gypsy

// Makin' Plans //

If I ever left this town 

I'd never settle down 

I'd just be wanderin' around 

If I ever left this town 


If I wasn't by your side 

I'd never be satisfied 

Nothin' would feel just right 

If I wasn't by your side 


'Cause I'm not easy to understand 

But you know me like the back of your hand 

I'm your girl and you're my man 

And we're makin' plans.... 


We can go on and on 

Won't ever feel too long 

I'll always call you home 

And we'll go on and on 


'Cause I know you like the back of my hand 

Got a heart of gold and a piece of land 

I'm your girl and you're my man 

And we're makin' plans....

// Time To Get A Gun //

My neighbor's car got stolen last night

Right out of his driveway

We heard the dogs barking 

We never paid them any mind

And Mary say's she's going to lock the door 

From now on when we go away 

I've been walking around this farm

Wondering if it's time


Time to get a gun 

That's what I've been thinking 

I could afford one 

If I did just a little less drinking 

Time to put something

Between me and the sun

When the talking is over

It's time to get a gun 


Last week a government man was there

When I walked out my back door

 He said I'm sorry to bother you ma'am

It don't matter anymore 

Cause even while we were talking 

Right here where we stand

They're making plans for a four way highway

And a big old over pass 


Time to get a gun 

That's what I've been thinking 

I could afford one 

If I did just a little less drinking 

Time to put something

Between me and the sun

When the talking is over

It's time to get a gun 


Mary says she's worried about herself and her kids

She's never known anybody who had a gun 

And her daddy never did 

But I think it should be up to me 

Cause when it's all said and done

Somebody's gotta walk into the night

And I'm going to be that one 


Time to get a gun 

That's what I've been thinking 

I could afford one 

If I did just a little less drinking 

Time to put something

Between me and the sun

When the talking is over

It's time to get a gun 


When the party is over 

It's time to get a gun

// Somewhere Trouble Don't Go //

Devil had a daughter 

Took him to deep water 

Tried to kill him with a kiss

He said hey now honey

What about the money 

I said I ain't got time for this 


Take me take me somewhere trouble don't go

Make me make me someone trouble don't know 


He said baby come inside 

I said sorry I got to ride

Sorry but I got to ride 

You know you could end up dead 

For sleeping in the devil's bed

Sleeping in a devil's bed


Take me take me somewhere trouble don't go

Make me make me someone trouble don't know 


Baby wants to drive my car

But he wants to go too far

But he wants to go too far

First comes love and it's so fine

Then comes heartache right behind

Then comes heartache behind 

My baby used to be so sweet

Now he won't come down my street

Now he won't come down my street 

All my plans got derailed 

He locked up my heart in jail

He locked up my heart in jail


Take me take me somewhere trouble don't go

Make me make me someone trouble don't know

Take me take me somewhere trouble don't go 

Make me make me someone trouble don't know

// The House That Built Me //

I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine.
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this old world and forgot who I am.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

// Love Song //

I was standing there crying in the kitchen 

It's been one of those mornings that's gonna last all day 

And he comes in, wraps his arms around me 

And I don't even have to say a thing 


That's what makes it love 

That's what makes it a love song 


He comes in, slams the door behind him 

And he can't hide the worry on his face 

Even though I got a million things to tell him 

I know right now he just needs some space 


That's what makes it love 

That's what makes it a love song 

That's what makes it love 

That's what makes it a love song 


Everybody always sings about it 

How they're never gonna live without it 

We don't even have to talk about it 

'Cuz We're livin it out 


That's what makes it love 

That's what makes it a love song 

That's what makes it love 

That's what makes it a love song

// Heart Like Mine //

I ain't the kind you take home to mama 
I ain't the kind to wear no ring 
Somehow I always get stronger 
When I'm on my second drink 

Even though I hate to admit it 
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes 
The Christian folks say I should quit it 
And I just smile and say "God Bless" 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine 

Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo 
But said he loved me anyway 
My brother got the brains of the family 
So I thought I'd learn to sing 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine 

I'll fly away from it all one day 
And I'll fly away 
These are the days that I will remember 
When my names called on a roll 
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses 
And make a toast to me coming home 

Cause I heard Jesus He drank wine 
And I bet we'd get along just fine 
He could calm a storm and heal the blind 
And I bet He'd understand 
Understand a heart like mine 
Oh yes He would

// Sin For A Sin //

I remember vividly what that vision did to me 

You laying with her in our bed 

Love can be a tradgedy 

When you do what you did to me 

All I'm seeing now is red 


I need to repent 

A sin for a sin 


Bible told me to forget 

All those who trespass against 

Tread their feet on sacred ground 


Bad things come with consequence 

What feels good, hurts in the end 

Dont want to think about that now 


I need to repent 

A sin for a sin 


Fire and brimstone 

Dirt and a headstone 

Bury them, baby 

Along with your sins 

Hear the thunder 

Six feet under 

Hit your knees 

Wont do it again 


Guilty pleasure 

Ease the pain 

Whisky runnin through my veins 

Too late to save you now 


I need to repent 

A sin for a sin 


Fire and brimstone 

Dirt and a headstone 

Bury them deep 

Along with your sins 

hear the thunder 

Six feet under 

hit your knees 

wont do it again 


I remember vividly 

What that vision did to me

// That's The Way The World Goes 'Round //

I know a gal that's got a lot to lose
She's a pretty nice lady, kinda confused
Got muscles in her head, ain't never been used
Thinks she owns half of this town

Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
She beats her old man with her panty hose
Then she takes him out, buys him new clothes
It's the way that the world goes 'round

That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round

I was sitting in the tub just counting my toes
When the radiator broke and the water froze
I got stuck in the ice without any clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown

I was crying ice cubes, hoping that I'd croak
When the sun come through the window and the ice all broke
I said "son of a gun", man, that's just a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round

That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
Got a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round

Well I said that's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you're up and the next you're down
Got a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round

// Virginia Bluebell //

Carrying the weight
On the end of a limb
You're just waitin' for somebody
To pick you up again

Shaded by a tree
Can't live up to a rose
All you ever wanted
Was a sunny place to grow

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell

Even through a stone
A flower can bloom
You just need a little push
Spring is coming soon

Umbrella in the rain
Let it roll off your back
Weather what you can
Realize what you have

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell

Put a little light in the darkest places
Put a little smile on the saddest faces

Pretty little thing
Sometimes you gotta look up
And let the world see
All the beauty that you're made of

'Cause the way you hang your head
Nobody can tell
You're my Virginia Bluebell
My Virginia Bluebell
