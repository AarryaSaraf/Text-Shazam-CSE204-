// All Kinds Of Kinds //

Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
Horatio the human cannonball
A weddin' 'neath the big top tent with barkers clowns and elephants
Sideshow family oddities and all
The dog-faced boy howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was crying
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddlin' she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

When I play this old guitar from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed my test into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
Ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds

Now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find
That ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds

// Fine Tune //

I've been missing all the vital signs
That I needed for love to work
Engine of a heart that would not start
had to jump it so much, it hurt
Everytime I looked under the hood 
It was always a mystery
You pulled up in a rescue truck and
Showed up with a master key
And revved it up for me

[Chorus]
My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God, you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools, you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune

You started tweaking on a little knob
That I didn't even know was there
Kissing on my wrist all the way to my neck
Running your fingers through my hair
I felt like I was dizzy and I didn't think I could drive
You flipped a switch, hotwired my gears
Yeah you put me in line
And now I'm running right

[Chorus]
My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God, you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools, you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune

[Chorus]
My Pulse was nearly gone 
I was almost in need of a defibrilator
I didn't know what went wrong
I had to shake it off but i got stuck
Oh my God, you turned all my loose strings
You're the love innovator that brings 
All the right tools, you know what to do
Fine tune
Fine tune

// Fastest Girl In Town //

You've got the bullets
I've got the gun.
I've got a hankering for getting into something

I hit the bottle, you hit the gas,
I heard your 65 can really haul some ass.

I'm feeling frisky, you're feeling good
I guess the whiskey is doing what it should
I got the cigarettes
You've got a lighter
And when the sun goes down we'll start a little fire

Ain't no use in trying to slow me down
'Cause you're running with the fastest girl in town

Ain't you baby?
I like 'em crazy.

My reputation follows me around
Just makes me want to give them more to talk about
Let's go to town for a little while
I'll be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile

Ain't no use in trying to slow me down
'Cause you're running with the fastest girl in town

Ain't you baby?
You're kinda crazy.

Come on!

I see the blue lights, we better run.
Throw out the bottle and I'll hide the gun
If he pulls us over I'll turn on the charm
You'll be in the slammer and I'll be on his arm.

Ain't no use in trying to slow me down
'Cause you're running with the fastest girl in town

Ain't you baby?
Well I told you I was crazy.
No I ain't no body's baby. 
Hey!

He's got the bullets 
He's got a gun
I got the hankering for getting into something.

// Safe //

Just like the fringe on my boots
You move with every step I take
You walk in front of me to make sure 
That I don't fall and break my own heart
Cause with you I could never

Just like the leather on my saddle
We get prettier with time
Together in the weather
Shiny on the other side
Polished and changed for the better

With you I'm safe
With you I'm safe

I follow you just like a shadow
Only closer and
If you get tied and bound
I'll find a way to free your hands
I'll wash them clean
Of everything but me

Sometimes you might get thirsty
So I'll catch the rain
Just like the ice in your glass
I'll rattle when you need a drink
You'll never run dry of love or anything

I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you safe

I keep a locket on my neck that holds your face
I'll spend forever making sure I can erase
Every tear you ever thought about crying

You make me feel like I'm the only girl in the whole wide world
I wanna hold you like a handful of diamonds and pearls
That I guard with my life or die trying

I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you safe

// Mama's Broken Heart //

I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, well it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

// Dear Diamond //

Dear diamond
Pretty and new
Perfectly flawless too good to be true
Dear diamond
You shine like the sun
Wrap around my finger just like he does

You cost more than he wanted to lose
And with this ring I said I do
Promised to never do what I've done
I've been lying to someone

Dear diamond
What will we do?
Lie like the devil or just face the truth
Dear diamond
Be my saving grace
What he don't know will kill him
That I can't face

You cost more than he wanted to lose
And with this ring I said I do
I promised to never do what I've done
I've been lying to someone
Dear diamond

Dear diamond
With your band of gold
Some people you have, some people you hold
Dear diamond
I promise to keep
This secret I have while he's holding me

// Same Old You //

So here you are
In your borrowed car
Kicking rocks around
Looking at your shoes
It's the same old you

Tell me where you been
And where you're going to
Where were you last night
Boy listen up when I'm talking to you
It's the same old you

Another lonely night
With that same old whiskey morning

It's the same old you
When you get to drinking
The same old you
When you're on the town
The same old you
In church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down

Well this time I done some thinking
And I think I'm done with you
Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too

Well your mama's gonna cry her eyes
There ain't gonna be no wedding day
What's she gonna say?
When I tell her how I had no choice
The same old you couldn't even raise your voice
And ask me to stay
I wouldn't anyway

So you can keep your ring
And I'll keep my daddy's name

It's the same old you
When you get to drinking
The same old you
When you're on the town
The same old you
In church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down

This time I done some thinking
And I think I'm done with you
Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too

Cause until I get to leaving
It's just the same old me too

// Baggage Claim //

I have been draggin' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
A little suitcase like a brick
It kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles on my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packin' it in, so come and get it

If it ain't obvious what has set me off today
Behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
Go on and take your little business trip with that sweet little habit
That you can't kick
You better call your momma when you get to town
Cause I ain't gonna be hangin' around

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Because it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles of my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
I'm packin' it in, so come and get it

Come and get it

Come and pick it up, pick it up
Before I blow it up in flames
You better pick it up, pick it up
Baby, I'm leaving everything

At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
And when you hit the ground, check the lost and found
Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles of my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car
Well I'm packin' it in, so come and get it

Come and get it

// Easy Living //

The weather man
Says rain today
We'll saddle up and be on our way
What's a little rain to a high ridin' rebel or two

Cuz it's easy living
Easy loving you

People keep searchin' for a reason why
They say life's a bitch and then you'll die
But I can't see
A reason for their point of view

Cuz it's easy living
Easy loving you

Talk shows talking how it's near the end
Of the one man woman
And the one woman man
We might fight like dogs
But hey we love the makin' up at the end of the day
Tomorrow that old sun will rise
I'll be laying here by your side
A coffee cup and a good morning kiss or two

Cuz its easy living
Easy loving you

Cuz it's easy living
Easy loving you

// Over You //

Weather man said it's gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
Mid-February shouldn't be so scary
It was only December
I still remember the presents, the tree, you and me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you

Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me

But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away,
How dare you?
I miss you
They say I'll be OK
But I'm not going to ever get over you

// Look At Miss Ohio //

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Runnin' around with your rag-top down
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushin' that wedding gown
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now
Yeah, I want do right but not right now.

// Better In The Long Run //

[Miranda]
Cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
One more down, to drink you off my mind
Lord knows I've tried a thousand times to give you up
But its closing time and we both know why

[Chorus]
I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run

[Blake Shelton]
We've been driving down this highway
Now we're out of gas, too far outta town
Oh here we are all tangled up and sideways
You're all broken down, yeah I'm breaking down

I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run

[Blake]
Oh maybe somewhere a little down the line
I'll get a little better leaving us behind
Maybe someday, Oh I'll be fine.

[Miranda]
Oh and you'll move on and I will too
But still I don't see gettin over you
Oh, no, no, no

I'm just too selfish I guess
I know you're tired and restless
It's no surprise we've come undone (ohh no)
But I can't unlove you just because
You say it's better in the long run

In the long run
Oh in the long run
In the long run
In the long run

// Nobody's Fool //

One more night with the same neon lights
And I'll find my place at the bar
One more dance so I'll buy one more round
And I'll try to drown out my heart

He'll walk in and make every head turn
And he'll always be dressed to kill
Day I left is my only regret
And now it's become his biggest thrill

All my friends say "hey don't you know him"
And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say he's nobody
And me, well I'm nobody's fool

Won't take long and he'll find him someone
And then pull them out for a dance
Every note tells me that's all she wrote
And reminds me how I missed my chance

When he's done he'll have a little more fun
And he'll let her act like she's smooth
As they walk out while I'm learning about
What it is to have nothing to lose

All my friends say "hey don't you know him"
And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say he's nobody
And me, well I'm nobody's fool

All my friends say "hey don't you know him"
And I'll try to play it off cool
When they ask I'll just say he's nobody
And me, well I'm nobody's fool

And me, well I'm nobody's fool

// Oklahoma Sky //

How long has it taken me to find you
Five hundred years, five hundred thousand miles
It don't matter now
Love's always on time
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky

Lightning flashed, everything went silent
A feather could have knocked me to the floor
Missing piece was found
I was finally alive
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky

With the speed of sound
I'm homeward bound mhmm

All our sorrows swept away forever
Each and every tear washed out to sea
There ain't no goodbye
With your hand in mine
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky
Oklahoma sky

// Hurts To Think //

Tongue is sharp
Got an ax to grind
Girls go wrong, men go right after them
I don't win and it's a compromise
You'll be the loser that pays the dividend

Far from you you'll find me
Such an easy target and a tragedy
You're just a shiver looking for a spine
You can have your way, but you can't have mine

If I had one wish you'd go away
I haven't snapped yet, but I'm on the brink of it
And I'm not as dumb as the look on your face
You'll never be half the man your mama is

Overloaded by the way you talk
A hairpin trigger that I can't stop
Empty words taking up my time
And you can have your way
But you can't have mine

'Cause every shot baby it feels like a resurrection
I'm looking for affection at the bottom of a bottle again
You show up and it starts another chain reaction
Oh but I can't tell if it's you or the drink
It's too hard to know
'Cause it hurts to think

Far from you you'll find me
Such an easy target and a casualty
You're just a shiver looking for a spine
You can have your way, but you can't have mine

'Cause every shot baby it feels like a resurrection
I'm looking for affection at the bottom of a bottle again
You show up and it starts another chain reaction
Oh but I can't tell if it's you or the drink
It's too hard to know
'Cause it hurts to think
Yeah it hurts to think
