Album: Platinum

// Girls //

Imagine a fighter with a centerfold face
Comes from a long line of blue collars and lace
With a grip like reins to a steed
And kisses for days
And imagine a winner holding pink champagne
Who still loves her daddy but changes her name
An overachiever, even she don't believe her own fame

You can't change her mind
(Even if you wanted to)
You can always try
(She'll see through to you, she'll see through you)
If you think you're the only one she'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' 'bout girls

Imagine your best friend and your worst enemy
Begs you to stay and then wishes you'd leave
Like Marilyn Monroe she can be who you want her to be

You can't change her mind
(Even if you wanted to)
You can always try
(She'll through to you, she'll see through you)
If you think you're the only one she'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' 'bout girls

Go on, go on
Give her everything and more
Love her all you want
She was never yours

You can't change her mind
You can always try
If you think you're the only one
She'll want in this world
Then you don't know nothin' about girls
If you think you're the only one
She'll want in this world
then you don't know nothing
No nothing
'bout girls.

// Platinum //

My disposition permeates
The room when I walk in the place
I'm sorry!
By calculation I'm way too much
Pretentiously I bitch a bunch
But you bought it!
I can't exceed my reputation
A small town girl with compensation
Exploitin' all my possibilities
Well don't you know I'll blaze a trail
But hell
You can come with me

What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my *hotels
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records
As it does on me

Historically real men prefer
The Marilyns with curls and curves
And I've got it!
Genetically or chemically
As long as it contains some bleach
I want it!

You don't need to be a fighter
Honey, just go one shade lighter
You'll acquire everything you want
When your roots grow out
And things go South
Hey, go back to the salon!

What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
My heels and my *hotels
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me

Hey! What doesn't kill you
Only makes you blonder
In fact, my heels and my hotels
They just got taller
Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me

Somethin' bout platinum irrefutably
Looks as good on records as it does on me

Platinum
Platinum
Somethin' bout platinum

// Little Red Wagon //

You only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
And my Dodge Dart classic
You said "I'll be Johnny and you'll be June
I'll ride with you to the moon"
But guess what?

[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
You can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Oh, heaven help me
I've been sowing wildflower seeds
And chasing tumble weeds
But that's just who I be
And you're just trying to slow this rolling stone
But I'm on to you baby
So guess what?

[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Oh, you only love me for my big sun glasses
And my Tony Lama's
I live in Oklahoma
And I've got long, blonde hair
And I play guitar, and I go on the road
And I do all the shit you wanna do
And my dog does tricks
And I ain't about drama, y'all
And I love my apron
But I ain't your mama!
So guess what?

[Chorus:]
You can't ride in my little red wagon
The front seat's broken and the axle's draggin'
No you can't step to this backyard swagger
You know it ain't my fault when I'm walkin' jaws droppin' like
Ooh, ahh, ooh, ahh
Oooohh, yeah. Ahhhhh. Oooooohh. Ah!

// Smokin' And Drinkin' //

It was one of those times when a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell like smoke
Hangin' with friends, goin' against our upbringin', smokin' and drinkin'

It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn't know quite what to do
We were goin' along with what was goin' on, sayin', "I think I love you."
And I think about us now every time that I go out smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gets ya thinkin' about the one that got away
Here's to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin' and drinkin'

We were livin' it up sayin' this town sucks so we painted it on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we're gonna miss
But damn we know it now cause it's all we talk about smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gets ya thinkin' about the one that got away
Here's to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gets ya thinkin' about the one that got away
Here's to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' gets ya thinkin' about the one that got away
Here's to all those nights when all we felt was like smokin' and drinkin'

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Smokin' and drinkin'
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Smokin' and drinkin'

// Priscilla //

We look like we got it made, don't we?
Permanent accessory
On their arms and always on their minds
Rings, we gotta wear the real big rings
Big smiles like figurines
Big hair for the real big kind
When they turn it on and slick back their hair
We turn around and the world's right there
Woman to woman, I'm starting to see
What happened to you is happening to me

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man?
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla

Golden gate, we have to put up a gate
To find time to procreate
Or at least that's what we read
Bodyguard, Didn't know I was his bodyguard
And I shouldn't have to play the part
At least while we're not in bed
You and me share a unique position
Married to a man who's married to attention
Couldn't think of anybody better to ask
How to be the first to make it last?

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla

Cause when they turn it on and slick back their hair
We turn around and the world's right there
Woman to woman, I'm starting to see
What happened to you is happenin' to me

Priscilla, Priscilla
How'd you get him to yourself?
Between the whistle calls and Southern dolls
It's enough to put a home, a home through Hell
Priscilla, Priscilla
He's always in high demand
How do you or don't you get the love you want when everybody wants your man
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
It's a difficult thing being Queen to the King
And I feel ya
Priscilla

// Automatic //

Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch for tellin' time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown 'cause I couldn't buy it yet

If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand,
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand,
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

Automatic

Let's roll the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand,
'Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

Yeah

Automatic

// Bathroom Sink //

Puttin' on my makeup
Puttin' off the hard stuff
Hopin' that it passes
Fake smile & eyelashes
I wash my hands and try not to think
Or dirty up my bathroom sink

I'm at it again with mama
Everybody's so tired of the drama
We're still fightin' like I'm sixteen
And I guess we always will be
She taught me how to pray and drink
And how to clean the bathroom sink

[Chorus:]
It's amazin', the amount of rejection
That I see in my reflection
And I can't get out of the way
I'm lookin' forward to the girl I wanna be
But regret has got a way of starin' me right in the face
So I try not to waste too much time
At the bathroom sink

It all gets complicated
And sometimes overrated
Glamour at it's finest
Just means someone's hidin'
From their own reality
And the mirror at their bathroom sink

[Chorus:]
It's amazin', the amount of rejection
That I see in my reflection
And I can't get out of the way
I'm lookin' forward to the girl I wanna be
But regret has got a way of starin' me right in the face
So I try not to waste too much time
At the bathroom sink

I pray as I get ready
For God to make me steady
And I thank Him for His patience
And I take my medication
And bless this day and all it brings
And I clean up the bathroom sink

// Old Sh!t //

Redman tobacco, Grandpa's two cents,
Old timers, "there in a pinch",
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Splittin' logs, smokin' hogs
Feedin' leftovers to a three legged dog,
I'm a fan of it, old shit

One man's trash is another man's treasure,
One man's pain is another man's pleasure,
If it's out of style, sure drives me wild
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Old turntables, vinyl records
Hand me down tools, Black and Decker
I'm a fan of it, old shit

One man's trash is another man's treasure,
One man's pain is another man's pleasure,
If it's out of style, sure drives me wild
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Singin' hymns, skippin' stones
When I think of him I think of home,
I'm a fan of it, old shit

Now Grandpa's trash is my treasure
He don't feel pain only pleasure
If it's out of style, sure drove him wild
So I'm a fan of it, old shit
Yeah I'm a fan of it, old shit

// All That's Left //

Get your shoes on, get your suitcase, your stereo and all of your CDs
No more talking, just start walking
Cause all that's left for you to do is leave
Tell your lawyer it's all over
Forget what he's got up his sleeve
No more signing, no more whining
Cause all that's left for you to do is leave

All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

Leave the dog here, he don't like you
And we'll go walking anytime we please
Leave the cat here, leave my hat here,
'Cause all that's left for you to do is leave

I'll keep the diamond on my finger and you'll keep all the bitter memories
Leave the dishes, no more kisses,
'Cause all that's left for you to do is leave

All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you do is leave

All that's left for you to do is leave
You said goodbye a long, long time ago
There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

There's the door, there's your car, here's the keys
And all that's left for you to do is leave

// Gravity Is A Bitch //

You spent your twenties feeling
That you're walking on the ceiling
And you party like you're eight feet tall
You say working's for the birds
Chasing dreams in mini skirts
From here everything seems small

Then thirties come around
And you finally feel the ground
Look around and maybe start planning
For what the future holds
And though you're far from old,
You moisturize and spend less time tanning

You're hanging over, but you're hanging in
You're starting to look like all of your friends
Conversations turning from rock n' roll
To kids and politics and how much money you owe

Got bags under your eyes, bigger hips and bigger thighs
You got places that you can't even itch
You can nip it, tuck it, squeeze it
But you're never gonna beat it
'Cause gravity is a bitch

Forty's kinda boring
And you spend your time ignoring
The things you don't see so clear
Your reflection in the glass
Is gonna knock you on your ass
You wonder how the hell'd it get down here

You're happy in your fifties
Though things are kinda shifty
At sixty you'll find peace of mind
Go to bed at 8 o'clock
And comb your hair if you still got it
'Cause you're almost at the finish line

You're hanging over, but you're hanging in
You're starting to look like all of your friends
Conversations turning from rock n' roll
To kids and politics and how much money you owe

Got bags under your eyes,
Bigger hips and bigger thighs
You got places that you can't even itch
You can nip it, tuck it, squeeze it
But you're never gonna beat it
'Cause gravity is a bitch

Yeah, gravity is a bitch
I'm here to tell ya
Gravity is a bitch

// Babies Makin' Babies //

Two kids from Tacoma
In a '72 Nova,
No pill and barely old enough to drink,
Learned the ropes and tested science,
Started pentecostal riots,
In just five minutes behind the rolling rink,
In the backseat brings

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it, then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till your eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah it's always in the water
Babies makin' babies

Between diplomas and the diapers,
They become couch quarter finders,
Savin' up for a Maytag microwave,
Oh but all has been forgiven,
On the day the water christen,
The best thing that could have happened by mistake,

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till your eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah it's always in the water
Babies makin' babies

Well it's a tried and true equation,
maintains a small town population,
Thats turns us all into a family,

The American dream on a shoestring,
First you grow it then you show it,
Give a good push just like a Brady,
Say you'll love them 'till you're eighty,
Too soon to be a mother and father,
But too late for the alma mater,
Yeah its always in the water,
Babies makin' babies

Yes it's always in the water,
Babies makin babies

// Somethin' Bad //

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

[Miranda:]
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Carrie:]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window, where you heading to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out the mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen…

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

[Carrie:]
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out the mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Miranda:]
'Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning don't know what happened

Whoa… Something bad
Whoa… Something bad

// Holding On To You //

I've seen the south of France
I've seen the sunset dance
Over Sunset Avenue
I've seen the Rolling Stones
Got real high on rock and roll
Seen a lot of dreams come true
But ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
That never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

I've seen a newborn child
Puts stars in her mama's eyes
And i pray to the man in the moon
I got drunk with the highway men
Felt the burn of the desert wind
Seen some promising I-dos
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, over the years
I've been moved to tears
By the wonders of this old world
One of God's mysteries
That never fails to get to me
Is the moment when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

Baby, we just rolled in
It's cold here in Michigan
Got a sold-out show tonight
Pretty soon we'll hit the stage
I'll feel the lights hit my face
We'll see some magic in the room
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

No, no, no, no

Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you
Ain't no moment like when I'm holding on to you

// Two Rings Shy //

I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Ain't gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain't wastin' good mascara just to watch it runnin' down
I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

I could spend an hour on my make-up and my hair
Shoes too tall, dress too small and lacy underwear
Go down to the bar, buy myself a drink
Dangle there all perfect, like a puppet on a string

I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Ain't gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain't wastin' good mascara just to watch it runnin' down
I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

You got girls that sing and dance, I hear one's an acrobat
You got 'em swinging from the chandelier, well, honey I don't swing like that
The main attraction's leaving, let the sideshow pay the rent
Take this diamond back, and you'll be two rings shy of the big top tent

I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Ain't gonna paint this pretty face like you paint the town
I ain't wastin' good mascara just to watch it runnin' down
I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown
Tiptoe 'cross the tightrope, 'til you turn me upside down
Cut the cable, pull the net just to let me hit the ground
I ain't gonna get dressed up just to be your clown

// Hard Staying Sober //

It's hard staying sober when you ain't staying over
It's easy getting messed up on the truth
It's hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It's hard staying sober when I'm getting over you

It's hard to the leave the house when all I think about
Is how hard it might be to come back home
I wait here and watch the rain when you come back for all your things
You'll get what you want and then you'll go

It's hard staying sober when you ain't staying over
It's easy getting messed up on the truth
It's hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It's hard staying sober when I'm getting over you

It's hard to quit this smoking when my will to fight is broken
It's hard to quit a habit in a rush
Hits me in the morning, just like you I'm looking for them
Can't seem to put down this pick-me-up

It's hard staying sober when you ain't staying over
It's easy getting messed up on the truth
It's hard standing here watching taillights disappear
It's hard staying sober when I'm getting over you

Why you think the world drinks?
Why you think the world smokes?
Why you think we all sit around and tell a bunch of dirty jokes?

Somebody somewhere is out having a ball
And somebody's laying around heartbroke

Why you think we all drink?
Why you think we all smoke?

Why you think we all drink?
Why you think we all smoke?

// Another Sunday In The South //

Only thing moving out here is this swing on the front porch
And the sun's beating down heatin' up this house like blow torch
Sitting here singing Dixie with a whistle
Man, it's hotter than a two-dollar pistol
Baby, I know that it's only 11:30
But sure as hell or high water
I'm gettin' kinda thirsty
I don't need your mama's lemonade
I need something from a can or a bottle on ice

Just another Sunday in the South
Wanna put on some Shenandoah
and crank it loud
You and me go Fishin' in the Dark
Killin' time with Restless Heart
Just another Sunday in the South

There's church bells ringin'
Down the road and we ain't goin'
I'm singin' Hallelujah right here
with the warm wind blowin'
Next to you, Sitting next to me
and we're shaking that sugar tree

Just another Sunday in the South
Wanna put on some Shenandoah
and crank it loud
All you gotta do is give me that wink
Man, this ain't no thinkin' thing
Just another Sunday in the South

Well, honey, it's a far cry
From our crazy lives
All you gotta do is turn on the radio
It'll take us back
It'll take us home

Just another Sunday in the South
Wanna put on some Shenandoah and crank it loud
You and me go fishin' in the dark
Killin' time with Restless Heart
Just another Sunday in the South
I'm gonna put on some Shenandoah and crank it loud
All you gotta do is give me that wink
Man, this ain't no thinkin' thing
Just another Sunday in the South
Just another Sunday
Yeah
Just another Sunday
(I can hear my mama callin')
just another sunday
(Sweet Sunday)
Just another Sunday
Oooohh
In the South
