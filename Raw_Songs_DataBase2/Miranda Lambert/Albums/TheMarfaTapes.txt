// Tin Man //

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart

Everytime you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breakin'
You'd never want a heart

Ohh, ohh, oh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far

You ain't missin' nothin'
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darlin', you don't want a heart

Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh

Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now

By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, ohh, oh

// Tequila Does //

His last name was Flores
He came up from Ju치rez lookin' for a hell of a time
With a blonde se침orita
And a tall margarita
We danced on the tables all night
Then I said, "Adi칩s, Casamigos is takin' me home tonight"

'Cause he don't love me like tequila does
Mmm, nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

I'd sure like to find
A cowboy tonight
To get me back in the saddle
But the boys around here
They drink domestic beer
They're all hat, no cattle
But I won't sleep alone
'Cause my old pal Patr칩n is takin' me home tonight

'Cause he don't love me like tequila does
Mmm, nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

Well, I might as well face it
I'm always chasin' a kiss with a twist of a lime
And when I'm drinkin' doubles
I'm nothin' but trouble
And trouble's so easy to find
So, hand me a sombrero
'Cause Jose Cuervo
Is takin' me home tonight (Takin' her down tonight)

He don't love me like tequila does
Mmm, nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does
He don't love me like tequila does
Mmm, nobody can
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does
He don't give me that border town buzz
Like tequila does

// I Don't Like It //

Yeah, I love it when you wake me up
And kiss me till the coffee's cold
I love it when you make your plans
About how we're gonna both grow old
I love it when you laugh real hard
I love to hold you when you cry
I love it when you get so high
Fly around like a firefly

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

Hey, I love it when you say my name
I love it when you sing a song
I always love to sing along
I always get the words all wrong

Yeah, I love it when you say let's go
To somewhere we've never been
I love you 'cause you love me back
I love you, you're my friend

But I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

I don't like it when you walk away
I don't like it when you disappear
I don't like being away from you
I don't like it when you're not here

// The Wind's Just Gonna Blow //

It's hard to see the writing
On the wall that I keep fighting
My eyes are closed
My fists are clenched
Trying to find forgiveness is like breaking into prison
Getting caught up on a razor wire fence
Always give it one more day
Thunder clouds roll away
I already know
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow

I used to make you love me
Laugh and want to touch me
Now I drink alone and cry at my own jokes
Your halo's in the dresser drawer
And I don't wear my ring no more
Kids and time will learn to love us both
We both hate to see it end
Skies are getting dark again
It's time for me to go
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow

Sing along storms never last
Bad times, they all pass
For me and you they don't
Dust ain't ever gonna settle
The wind's just gonna blow

// Am I Right Or Amarillo //

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
And you just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

These truck stop bars are lonely
These highways, they don't quit
You might be my one and only
If we keep meeting like this

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

It's too late to stop drinking
Too early to go home
There's a flashing vacancy sign
Just across the road

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

My ring is on my key chain
Your diamond's in your purse
It won't feel like cheating
If nobody gets hurt

Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Come lay down on my pillow
'Til the dawn comes breaking through
Am I crazy, I don't know
You just might be, too
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you
Am I right or Amarillo
Am I wrong for loving you

// Homegrown Tomatoes //

Sittin' in the shade, loaded lemonade, watching the hummingbirds
Humming me a tune all afternoon, best song I've never heard
Texas sky and big blue eyes staring over aviators
Got a big boom box, Bulleit on the rocks, homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Brisket on cooking low and long smoking up the neighborhood
If we do it right we can go all night like Emmy and Dollywood
If you ain't in it for fun tonight, it's see ya later alligator
We're US prime, weed and wine, homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Come on Guy, get us all high, sing us a country song
We're all fucked up, fallin' in love, everybody's singing along
Tequila shots, Bud Light top, she's a little instigator
It's party time, we're ripe on the vine like homegrown tomatoes

Homegrown tomatoes
Homegrown tomatoes
Homegrown tomatoes

// Breaking A Heart //

Everybody's sorry
Everybody's sad
Everybody's losin'
Somethin' that they can't get back
What if I regret it?
Givin' up the fight
It's harder to explain it
When no one's really wrong or right

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart

It's killin' me to do this
I don't really know
How I'm gettin' through this?
I really do wish you were the one lettin' go

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart

Goodbyes are never easy
I don't know if the hardest part
Is being heartbroken or breakin' a heart
Being heartbroken or breakin' a heart

// Ghost //

I burned your Levi's and your pearl snap shirts
Ashes to ashes and dirt to dirt
Buried our love in a deep dark hole
Now you're just a ghost

If you're such a poet, write an epitaph
You and I both know you ain't coming back
I sure loved you but I let you go
Now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost

My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver-tongued devil, you can't hold me down
Silly boy, only heaven knows
That I ain't afraid of ghosts

I replaced the headboard with a chiseled stone
Here lies the meanest man I've ever known
Go rest in peace with every lie you ever told
'Cause now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost

My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver tongued devil, you can't hold me down
Silly boy, even heaven knows
That I ain't afraid of ghosts

I've got 10, 000 angels here to pull me through
I've cried the last tear that I'll cry for you
You're just a shell of a man that I used to hold
Now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost
And I ain't afraid of ghosts

// We'll Always Have The Blues //

Jukebox serenade
Sawdust under my Luccheses
Finally in each other arms
Singing "Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star"

It's only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Maybe one more dance for two
We can't have each other
But we'll always have the blues

It's not trouble, it's just dancin'
Just a couple second glances
You can't have me, I can't have you
That's why we'll always have the blues

If only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Maybe one more dance for two
We can't have each other
We'll always have the blues

If only for tonight
It's almost closing time
Give us one more dance for two
We'll never have each other
But we'll always have the blues

We can't have each other
But we'll always have the blues

// Two-Step Down To Texas //

If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Take you down to the Broken Spoke and we'll dance the night away
'Round and 'round we'll go for broke 'til the Lone Star light of day
Honey, if we get the blues we'll look for Stevie Ray
If we fall Asleep at the Wheel, well baby that's okay

If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Mosey down to the Continental or the Carousel
Catch last call for alcohol at the old Lone Star Motel
Migas at the old Magnolia, then we'll drive a spell
And do shady things in Dripping Springs, honey I don't kiss and tell

If you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Well, if you ever get time to two-step down to Texas
Find yourself down 'round Austin way
I'll be waiting every time with my cowboy hat and wine
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me
If you two-step down to Texas and go steppin' out with me

Bye, Y'all

// Anchor //

When the moonlight hits the water
The reflection hits your eyes
I can't take it any longer
And this rope is pulling tight

Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly

When you give in there's a stillness
And a comfort you can find
When you give up there's salvation
In the sweetest suicide

Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly

Be my angel
Come and save me
Come and take me
To the other side

// Amazing Grace (West Texas) //

Out in West Texas it hardly ever rains
When it does its Amazing Grace
You can hear the cattle from a million miles away
To a cowboy's heart it's Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the word of God and Amazing Grace

Watching the sunset, drinking whiskey and lemonade
When it falls, it's Amazing Grace
She looks like an angel with the moonlight on her face
When she smiles it's Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the Word of God and Amazing Grace

And the church bells ring in the little bitty towns
And the people come from miles and miles around
Just to hear that old piano feed their faith
With the Word of God and Amazing Grace

Out in West Texas it hardly ever rains
But when it does it's Amazing Grace
