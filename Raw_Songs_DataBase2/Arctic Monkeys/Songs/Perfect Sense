Richard of York: The Executive Branch
Having some fun with the warm-up act
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes

A four figure sum on a hotel notepad
A revelation or your money back
That's what it takes to say goodnight
Sometimes I wrap my head around it all and it makes perfect sense

Keep reminding me that it ain't a race
When my invincible streak turns onto the final straight
If that's what it takes to say goodnight
Then that's what it takes
