Lego Napoleon movie written in noble gas-filled glass tubes underlined in sparks
I'll admit it's elaborate for a waking thought
Vortex to vortex, The Business they call Show
Hasn't ever been this pumped up before
Hello Gruesome, there's just enough time left to swing by and re-address the start
If you call and have them pull around the car and stop specialising in stories from the road

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

As that meandering chapter reaches its end and leaves us in a thoughtful little daze
This electric warrior's motorcade shall burn no more rubber down that boulevard
Read the message I left on the thank you card
Overtaking the tractor, waiting for sets of winds and bends to level out again
Picking your moment along a country lane
The kind where the harmonies feel right at home

Hello you
Still dragging out a long goodbye?
I ought to apologise
For one of the last times

Taking a dive into your crystal ball
I've snorkelled on the beaches fruitlessly
Why not rewind to Rawborough Snooker Club?
I could pass for seventeen if I
Just get a shave and catch some Zzz
