// When Your Lover Has Gone //

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone
He's gone, oh gone

// Love Me Or Leave Me //

Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely then happy with somebody else

You might find the night time, the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and you give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and you give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else
Nobody else, nobody else

// I Hear Music //

I hear music, mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

Sure that's music, mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right nearby

That's my favorite melody
You, my angel, phoning me

I hear music, mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song

That's my favorite melody
You, my angel, phoning me

I hear music, mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this crazy song

// What Am I Here For? //

What am I here for,
Living in mis'ry,
Now that you've gone from my heart
That was my fear for
You were my future
There was no reason to part

'Till I hope you change your mind
And that somehow you will find
You are meant to be my own
I'll be lost if I'm alone

I know you remember
All that you told me
Times when you'd hold me so tight
How could you grieve me
How could you leave me
Knowing your love is my light

In your heart there should be
Thoughts of your return to me
I will be happy
Patiently waiting
Knowing then just why I'm here

I know you remember
All that you told me
Times when you'd hold me so tight
How could you grieve me
How could you leave me
Knowing your love is my light

In your heart there should be
Thoughts of your return to me
I will be happy
Patiently waiting
Knowing then just why I'm here

// I'm Gonna Go Fishin' //

Woke up this morning wanting to cry
Then I remember, yes, I know why
She's a real good one for having her cake
I'm gonna go fishing or jump in the lake

Yeah, I'm gonna go fishing, that's what I'll do
Think about nothing, not even you
Catch a real big one, a big speckled trout
Snapping in the water, I'll pull him on out

Sweet talking liar, spin me a yarn
Tell me a story, big as a barn
Don't stop listening, I won't hear you out
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout

If a gal is a liar, a gal is a fool
Playing for keepers and breaking the rules
She'll be the loser, yet to find out
I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout

Here in the water, look at him shine
There goes a big one, that one is mine
Catch up the reel now, I've got the feel now
Hooked onto my fly rod, I've got me a trout

Sweet talking liar, you're in for a fall
You tell me a story, you cut to the wall
Don't go my way, I'm down the highway
I'm gonna go fishing

Yes, I'm gonna go fishing
Yes, I'm gonna go fishing and get me some trout

// I Only Have Eyes For You //

"Are the stars out tonight? 
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 
'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear 
The moon may be high 
But I can't see a thing in the sky 
'Cause I only have eyes for you.

I don't know if we're in a garden 
Or on a crowded avenue 
You are here, so am I 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden 
Or on a crowded avenue 
You are here, so am I 
Maybe millions of people go by 
But they all disappear from view 
And I only have eyes for you."

// The Gentleman Is A Dope //

The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults
A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rumba from a Waltz
The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea
Why do I get in a dither? He doesn't belong to me

The gentleman isn't bright, he doesn't know the score
A cake will come, he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue but little do they see
Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn't belong to me

He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well as I

The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you'd like to hug and hold against you heart
The gentleman is a dope doesn't know how happy he could
Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me
He'll never belong to me

He's somebody else's problem, she's welcome, welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well, well as I

The gentleman is a dope, he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you'd like to hug and hold against you heart
The gentleman is a dope doesn't know how happy he could
Look at me crying my eyes out, as if he belonged to me
He'll never belong to me

// Mean To Me //

Mean to me
Why must you be mean to me?
Gee, honey, it seems to me
You love to see me cryin'

I don't know why
I stay home each night
When you say you'll phone
You don't and I'm left alone.
Sing the blues and sighin'

You treat me coldly each day in the year
You always scold me
Whenever somebody is near, dear

It must be great fun to be mean to me
You shouldn't, for can't you see
What you mean to me

// Alone Together //

Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, we're not too proud
To cling together, we're strong
As long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night, were not in vain
For we're together and what is there
To fear together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together

// Pick Yourself Up //

Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up, dust myself off
And start all over again

Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So, take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
Start all over again

Work like a soul inspired
Till the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son

Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off
And start right over again
