// A Night In Tunisia //

The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with its cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

[bridge]

[scat]

[Repeat all twice]

[scat]

Each wonderful night in Tunisia

// You're My Thrill //

You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

Hmmm-nothing seems to matter
Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps morning higher
When I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill

// My Reverie //

Our love
Is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool
Never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel
As you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me
As I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

// Stella By Starlight //

The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

// Jersey Bounce //

[scat intro]
They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
And now you hear it everywhere

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

[scat]
How I love that Jersey bounce
[scat]
Oh come on and play that Jersey bounce
[scat]

They call it that Jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Whenever they play that Jersey Bounce

It started on Journal Square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
That tune called the Jersey Bounce

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, make it sound the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some Jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The Jersey bounce'll make you swing

Ounce by ounce
The Jersey Bounce
Puts you right in the swing
That Jersey Bounce
It'll make you swing

Give me that Jersey Bounce.

// Signing Off //

Signing off
Does it surprize you
I won't need your lips anymore
Signing off
Can't idolize you
My heart crossed your name off the door

Signing off
Now that I've told you
That this is just where I came in
Signing off
Why should I hold you
You've already said I can't win

It's strange how the rest of the world knows
The things you should see at a glance
And I want what all of the world knows
A person to person romance

Signing off
I can't pretend dear
My trip to the stars took a spill
We're all through
This is the ending
Because you only wanted a thrill
I'm signing off

I'll always remember the pleasure
Of friendship and all that it's worth
I know that it's something to treasure
From here to the ends of the earth

Signing off
Happy I met you
So please make me happy again
And be sure I won't forget you
The best of everything until then
I'm signing off

Signing Off

// Cry Me A River //

Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried, cried, cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, remember, all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now, now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river, cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you

If my pillow could talk, imagine what it would have said
Could it be a river of tears I cried in bed?
So you can cry me a river
Daddy, go ahead and cry that river
Cause I cried, how I cried a river over you
How I cried a river over you

// This Year's Kisses //

This year's crop of kisses
Don't seem as sweet to me
This year's crop just misses
What kisses used to be
This year's new romance
Doesn't seem to have a chance
Even helped by Mr. Moon above
This year's crop of kisses is not for me
For I'm still wearin' last year's love

// Good Morning Heartache //

Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seems you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you, when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartacheâ€¦ what's new

Stop haunting me now, can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache
You're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin' around
Good morning heartache, sit down

// (I Was) Born To Be Blue //

Some folks were meant to live in clover,
But they are such a chosen few.
And clover being green is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue.

When there's a yellow moon above me,
They say there's moonbeams I should view
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue.

When I met you the world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel

Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks,
I've known the thrill of loving you.
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue.

// Clap Hands Here Comes Charlie! //

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, good time Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

This way, join the party
I say, meet McCarty
Hey, hey, Charlie take a bow

Ginger ale and white rock for his table
Grab a chair, move over there
And let him sit right next to Mabel

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, good time Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, good time Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

This way, meet The Dollies
I say, Zeigfield Follies
Hey Charlie, take a bow

See the smile on all those hungry faces
They can tell that he's a buyer
From those wide and open spaces

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, good time Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

Clap hands, here comes Charlie now
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

See the smile on all those hungry faces
They can tell that he's a buyer
From those wide and open spaces
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie, oh boy, yeah

Ginger ale and white rock for his table
Grab a chair, move over there
And let him wail
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, good time Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

This way, join the party
I say, meet McCarty
Hey, hey, Charlie take a bow

See the smile on all those hungry faces
They can tell that he's a buyer
From those wide and open spaces

Clap hands, here comes Charlie
Clap hands, here comes Charlie now

He's a big man with his ladies
And sail her with his doubt
When he starts to wail and holler, "Go man go, go!"

Oh boy, there was Charlie
What joy, swingin' Charlie
Clap hands, there goes Charlie now

// The Music Goes 'Round And Around //

I blow thru here
The music goes 'round and around
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
And it comes out here
I push the first valve down
The music goes down and around
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
And it comes out here
I push the middle valve down
The music goes down around below
Below, below, deedle-dee-ho-ho-ho
Listen to the jazz come out
I push the other valve down
The music goes 'round and around
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
And it comes out here

// I Got A Guy //

I got a guy
He don't dress me in sable
He looks nothing like Gable
But he's mine
And I think he's too divine
I got a guy
When he starts into pet me
He's the sauce on spaghetti
He's the kind that you can't keep off you mind
I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up
I swear, he'll be a Tiffany solitaire
I'm riding high
'Cos I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing can scare me
'Cos I got a guy

I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up
I swear, he'll be a Tiffany solitaire
I'm riding high
'Cos I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing can scare me
'Cos I got a guy

// This Could Be The Start Of Something Big //

You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at Twenty-One and watchin' your diet,
Declining a charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.

This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me....and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me....and see.

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something...
This could be the heart of something...
This could be the start of something big.
