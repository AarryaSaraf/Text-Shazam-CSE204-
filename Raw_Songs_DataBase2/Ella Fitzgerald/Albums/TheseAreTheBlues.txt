Album: TheseAreTheBlues

// Jailhouse Blues //

This house is surely getting raided
Yes, sir

30 days in jail
With my back turned to the wall
30 days in jail
With my back turned to the wall
Look here Mr. Jailkeeper
Put another gal in my stall

I don't mind being in jail
But I gotta stay there so long
I don't mind being in jail
But I gotta stay there so long
Every friend I've had
Done shook hands and gone

Better stop your man
From tickling me under my chin
Better stop your man
From tickling me under my chin
If he keeps on tickling
I'm gonna lick him on in

Good morning blues
Blues, how do you do?
Good morning blues
Blues, how do you do?
I just came here to have a few words
Have a few words with you

When a blues first got on me
They poured like a shower of rain
When a blues first got on me
They poured like a shower of rain
And I cried all night, honey
Ain't that a shame?

Going up to the country
And I can't take you
On up to the country and I can't take you
Nothing in the country
That a monkey man can do

// See, See Rider //

See, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord, made me love you, now your gal has come
You made me love you, now your gal has come

I'm goin' away, baby, I won't be back 'til fall
Lord, Lord, Lord, goin' away, baby, I won't be back 'til fall
If I find me a good man, won't be back at all

I'm gonna buy me a pistol, just as long as I am tall
Lord, Lord, Lord, shoot my man and catch a cannonball
If he won't have me, he won't have no gal at all

See, see rider, where did you stay last night?
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, your shoes ain't buttoned
Your clothes don't fit you right
You didn't come home until,'til the sun was shining bright

// You Don't Know My Mind //

I went to the racetrack, my man he won
Gave the money to another gal and wouldn't give me none

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I said to papa, "Can you stand to see me cry?"
He said, "Gal, I can stand to see you die."

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

He said he didn't want me, I wasn't good enough
I'm gonna get myself another man and call his bluff

You don't know, you don't know my mind
'Cause when you see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I'm not good lookin', I don't dress fine
But I'm the kind of woman who will take her time

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

The grass is green, and the mountains are blue
That's not tellin' what I'm thinkin' about you

You don't know, you don't know my mind
Yeah you see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I said you don't know, you never know
I said you don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughin', I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'

// How Long, How Long Blues //

Tell me, baby, how long?
Baby, how long
Has that evenin' train been gone?
How long?
How long?
Baby, how long?

Heard the whistle blowin'
Couldn't see no train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long?
Baby, how long?

I'm sad and lonely all the whole day through
Why don't you write me and give me the news?
You have left me, yes, you left me
Singin' the blues, those how long blues

If I could holler like the mountain jack
I'd go up on a mountain and call my baby back
Tell me how long?
How long?
Oh, how long?

I went up on a mountain
Looked as far as I could see
That woman had my man
And the blues had poor me
Yes, tell me, baby
Tell me, baby, how long?
How long must I go on like this?

The brook runs into the river
The river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby a train is goin' to run into me
How long? How long?
How long?

I say
I'm sad and lonely all the whole day through
Why don't you write me?
Tell me, baby, what's the news?
You have left me, left me
Singin' those how long blues

// Hear Me Talking To Ya //

Rambling man makes no change in me
I'm gonna ramble back to my used to be

Ah, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

Eve and Adam in the garden taking a chance
Adam didn't take time to get his pants

Ah, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

I don't care whether they're old or young
When the chips were down they had to trouble the Lord

Ah yes, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

Hello Central, give me 609
What it takes to get it in these hips of mine

Ah yes, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come
