I had to call you on the 'phone,
because I feel so all alone.
Don't like this being on my own,
can't you, won't you hurry home.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
like me you find you're out of place,
I'd give the world to see your face,
can't you, won't you hurry home.

I've learned a lot that I didn't know,
I was a fool when I let you go.
Since you've been gone it's all very clear:
Life is just an empty thing without you, dear.

I made an awfully big mistake
Oh what a difference love can make.
Please give my heart another break,
can't you, won't you hurry home.

I set the clock to ring at eight.
It didn't work so I was late.
I'm worried 'cause I'm losing weight
can't you, won't you hurry home.

Our pet canary simply won't sing,
There's something wrong, the doorbell won't ring.
When you're away it's all very clear:
Life is just a bowl of sour milk, my dear.
I'm tired of eating food that's canned,
and nothing's turned out like I planned.
I know that you will understand,
can't you, won't you hurry home.
