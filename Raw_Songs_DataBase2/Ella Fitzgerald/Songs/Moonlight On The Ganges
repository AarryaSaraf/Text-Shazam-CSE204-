Moonlight on the Ganges my little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true

Someday on the Ganges I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore

My little Hindu
When I whisper love's sweet melody
All our dreams and our schemes came true

Someday on the Ganges I'll meet you once more
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore
