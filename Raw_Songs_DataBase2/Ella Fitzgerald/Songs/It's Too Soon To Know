Does he love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so?
Is he fooling?
Is this all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?

A one-sided love
Would break my heart
He may be just acting
And playing a part
If he don't love me
Let him tell me so
I can't hold him
If he wants to go

Though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know

Does he love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so?
Is he fooling?
Is this all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?

Though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know
