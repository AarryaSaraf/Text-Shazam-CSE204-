Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have aroused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad

I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
And the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life
Just catching colds and missing trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And everytime I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool
Who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
I sent an air mail special too
You answer was goodbye
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
I sent an air mail special too
You answer was goodbye
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me, poor me
Everything happens to me
