Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening, down in Lovers Lane she strayed

Madam, Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch to day

When she woke up and found
That her dream of love was gone, madam
She ran to the man
Who had led her so far astray

And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun
And shot her lover down, madam

Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today

When the mob came and got her
And dragged her from the jail, madam
They strung her upon the old willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam

Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today

Miss Otis regrets
She's unable to lunch today
