What they're saying, is it true
That your love is burning low?
If you've found somebody new
Don't you think I ought to know?

Dining at the club alone
I can feel the people stare;
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you think I ought to care?

You know, darlin', I've always had
Such faith in you and the yarns you've spun
But, like a fool, I've lived and learned
That half a love is worse than none

If I can't have all of you
Though I can't believe it's so
If you really mean you're through
Don't you think I ought to know?

You know, darlin', I've always had
Such faith in you and the yarns you've spun
But, like a fool, I've lived and learned
That half a love is worse than none

If I can't have all of you
Though I can't believe it's so
If you really mean you're through
Don't you think I ought to know?
