I've got your number
I know you inside out
You ain't no Eagle Scout
You're all at sea

Oh yes, you brag a lot
Wave your own flag a lot
But you're unsure a lot
You're a lot like me, oh

I've got your number
And what you're looking for
And what you're looking for
Just suits me fine

We'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

I've got your number
And I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
And more

So go ahead and pick a number
From one to ten
You're losing streak is over
I can't win again
And here's the punchline
You've got mine
