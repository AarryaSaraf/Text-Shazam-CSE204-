Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer
Sing on, until
You bring back the thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon
Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last

So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally

Not a whisper of despair
But sweet tender love's own prayer
Own prayer
Of a sentimental tune that died long ago
Too soon, too soon
Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
Gossiping voices made us break up
But you know we still can make up
If we forget them all
And answer Cupid's call
Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
All it will take to lose my gloom
Is just a whisper not of rumors
But of your love for me
And that's how it's got to be

So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally
Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Love will whisper on eternally
