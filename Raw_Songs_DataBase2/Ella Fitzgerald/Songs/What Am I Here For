What am I here for,
Living in mis'ry,
Now that you've gone from my heart
That was my fear for
You were my future
There was no reason to part

'Till I hope you change your mind
And that somehow you will find
You are meant to be my own
I'll be lost if I'm alone

I know you remember
All that you told me
Times when you'd hold me so tight
How could you grieve me
How could you leave me
Knowing your love is my light

In your heart there should be
Thoughts of your return to me
I will be happy
Patiently waiting
Knowing then just why I'm here

I know you remember
All that you told me
Times when you'd hold me so tight
How could you grieve me
How could you leave me
Knowing your love is my light

In your heart there should be
Thoughts of your return to me
I will be happy
Patiently waiting
Knowing then just why I'm here
