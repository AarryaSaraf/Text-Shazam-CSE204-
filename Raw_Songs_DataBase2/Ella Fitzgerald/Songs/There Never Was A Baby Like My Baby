There never was a baby like my bady
No other baby ever had that smile
Since he's around, I just can't be a cry baby
My baby made life worthwhile

There never was another doll or guy baby
Who looked exactly like my valentine
He was specially designed for me
And if you should want his double
Brother are you in trouble
Never, no never, a baby like mine

No, there never was another doll or guy baby
Who looked exactly like my valentine
He was specially designed for me
And if you should want his double
Brother are you in trouble
Never, no never, a baby, baby like mine
