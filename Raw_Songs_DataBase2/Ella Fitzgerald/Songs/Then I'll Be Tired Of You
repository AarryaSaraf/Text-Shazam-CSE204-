I'll be tired of you
When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming
Then I'll be tired of you

This I know is true
When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you.

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right
Till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering whispering
If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right
Till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering whispering
If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you
