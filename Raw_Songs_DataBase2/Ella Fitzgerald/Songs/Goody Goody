So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
so you met someone and now you know how it feels, goody goody!
well you gave her your heart too, just as I gave mine to you
and she broke it in little pieces, now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night, goody goody!
and you found that loves a barrell of dynamite!
hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya
goody goody for you! goody goody for me!
ya I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!

Do you remember me sittin' all alone waitin' for the tinkle of the telephone?  
Now the action jackson's turned right around, goody goody!

Yes you remember me, I was all for you, sittin' waitin' hoping like you told me too.
Now the action jackson's turned right around

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya.
Goody goody for her.
Goody goody for me.
And I hope she tans your hide you rascal, I hope your satisfied you rascal.
So goody good good for me you rascal you!
