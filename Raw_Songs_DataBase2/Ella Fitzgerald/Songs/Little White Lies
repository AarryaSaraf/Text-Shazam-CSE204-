The moon was all aglow
And heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears

The devil was in your heart
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips
Who ever could doubt those eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies

Those little white, tiny white, little white lies
