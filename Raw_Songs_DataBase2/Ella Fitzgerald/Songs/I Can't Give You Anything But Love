I can't give you anything but love, b-a-b-y, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
We're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess
All those things you've always pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darned well, oh baby
I can't give you anything but love



Can't give you anything, anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love
