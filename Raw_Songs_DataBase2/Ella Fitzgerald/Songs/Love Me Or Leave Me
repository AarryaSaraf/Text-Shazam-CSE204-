Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely then happy with somebody else

You might find the night time, the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and you give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and you give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else
Nobody else, nobody else
