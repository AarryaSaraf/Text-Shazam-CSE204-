I hear you plunkin' with a bass and guitar, oh yes
Oh, beat it Daddy, Daddy eight to the bar

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But this guy he likes the best is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he dance with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he dance with the bass and guitar
They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"

Plunk it, plunk it, plunk it, Herby

I hear you plunkin', I hear you plunkin', I hear you plunkin', Herby
Eight to the bar
Come on and beat me, come on and beat me
Eight to the bar

Plunk plunk, plunk plunk the guitar
Plunk plunk, plunk plunk the guitar
Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar

Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar

Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar
