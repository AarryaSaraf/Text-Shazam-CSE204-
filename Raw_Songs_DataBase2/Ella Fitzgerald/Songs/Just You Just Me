Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot round wonderful you



To cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination



You and I
I've never left alone
Our necessities mostly privacy
Every sweetheart that the world has known
Hopes to find someday a perfect hideaway

Just just just you
Just just just me
Let's find a cozy spot to cuddle and coo
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you

Oh gee what are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination

Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot round wonderful you
