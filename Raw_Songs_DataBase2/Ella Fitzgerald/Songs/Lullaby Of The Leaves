Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
Days so long ago when I was a tot, so high
And now that I have grown
I've found myself alone

Cradle me where summer skies can watch me with a million eyes
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Cover me with Heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
That pine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me
I've heard it before
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

That's heaven
Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Oh, sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

Lullaby of the leaves
