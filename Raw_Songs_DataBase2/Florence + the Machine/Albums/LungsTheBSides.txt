// Swimming //

Your songs remind me of swimming,
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Dragged further away from the shore,
And deeper into the drink

Sat on the bottom of the ocean,
A stern and stubborn rock
'Cause your songs remind me of swimming,
But somehow I forgot

I was sinking, and now I'm sunk
I was drinking, and now I'm drunk
Your songs remind me of swimming,
But somehow I forgot

I tried to remember the chorus,
I can't remember the verse
'Cause that song that sent me swimming,
Is now the life jacket that burst

Rotting like a wreck on the ocean floor,
Sinking like a siren that can't swim anymore
'Cause our songs remind me of swimming,
But I can't swim anymore

Pull me out the water, cold and blue,
I open my eyes and I see that it's you,
So I dive straight back in the ocean
So I dive straight back in the ocean

Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
Cross my fingers and hope for the best

Then all of a sudden, I heard a note,
It started in my chest and ended in my throat
Then I realized, then I realized, then I realized
I was swimming,
Yes, I was swimming
And now I'm swimming,
Yes, I am swimming

Your songs remind me of swimming
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Your songs remind me of swimming,
Which I forgot when I started to sink
Oh, your songs remind me of swimming,
Which I forgot when I started
Your songs remind me of swimming,
Which I forgot when I started to sink

// Heavy In Your Arms //

I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown

I was a heavy heart to carry
My feet dragged across ground
And he took me to the river
Where he slowly let me drown

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms

And is it worth the wait
All this killing time?
Are you strong enough to stand
Protecting both your heart and mine?

Who is the betrayer?
Who's the killer in the crowd?
The one who creeps in corridors
And doesn't make a sound

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

My love has concrete feet
My love's an iron ball
Wrapped around your ankles
Over the waterfall

I'm so heavy, heavy
Heavy in your arms
I'm so heavy, heavy
So heavy in your arms

This will be my last confession
I love you never felt like any blessing
(Ohhhh)
Whispering like it's a secret
Only to condemn the one who hears it
With a heavy heart

Heavy heavy I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so) Heavy heavy I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so) Heavy heavy I'm so heavy in your arms
(I'm so) Heavy heavy I'm so heavy in your arms

I was a heavy heart to carry
My beloved was weighed down
My arms around his neck
My fingers laced to crown

I was a heavy heart to carry
But he never let me down
When he held me in his arms
My feet never touched the ground

I'm so heavy, heavy in your arms

Heavy, I'm so heavy in your arms

// Ghosts //

I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't steal from me
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop haunting me
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you kill me

There's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall at your feet

There but for the grace of God go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough to die

I'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a thief, just don't
And I love you so much, I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a ghost, just stop

There's a ghost in my mouth and it talks in my sleep
Wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks, then it walks with my legs
To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
To fall, to fall

To fall, to fall, to fall, to fall,
To fall, to fall, at your feet

There but for the grace of God go I
And when you kiss me, I am happy enough

// You've Got The Dirtee Love //

[Dizzee Rascal]
Everybody wants to be famous,
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless,
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers,
Want a fat crib with the acres,
So they spend money that they ain't made yet,
Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet,
Spend their paycheck
In the west out on a weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend.
But they don't care cause their life is a movie,
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly,
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks,
Can't keep up with the cover notes,
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit in debt
They still don't get it
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Huggin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

[Florence]
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
(That's right)
Now and then it seems like life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

[Dizzee Rascal]
Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face
So many two-faced,
Checkin' their high sayin' they're ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the city's like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it a mirage
I see youngsters die because they tryna live large
And they all say

[Florence]
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord, I just don't care"
(That's right, that's right)
But you've got the love I need to see me through
(Check it, check it, come on, come on)

You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Check it)

[Dizzee Rascal]
We are living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough
I'm tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there ain't enough to share
It ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares who dares to make a change
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same
Again and again I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they play sailin'
But I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession I can't front I'm in the forefront
Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain't forgotten,

[Florence]
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
You got the love
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
(Who's got the love, who's got the love, who's got the love)

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord, I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me through

// Dog Days Are Over (Yeasayer Remix) //

Happiness hit her [repeat]

Leave all your love and your longing behind [repeat]

She killed it with kisses and from it she fled [repeat]

Run fast [repeat]

Leave all your love and your longing behind [repeat]

// Falling //

I've fallen out of favour
And I've fallen from grace
Fallen out of trees
And I've fallen on my face
Fallen out of taxis
Out of windows too
Fell in your opinion
When I fell in love with you

Oh-ooh [repeated]

Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief

Oh-ooh [repeated]

This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
This is a song for a scribbled out name
And my love keeps writing again and again
And again [15x]

I'll dance myself up
Drunk myself down
Find people to love
Left people to drown
I'm not scared to jump
I'm not scared to fall
If there was nowhere to land
I wouldn't be scared
At all [4x]
Fall [repeated]

Sometimes I wish for falling
Wish for the release
Wish for falling through the air
To give me some relief
Because falling's not the problem
When I'm falling I'm at peace
It's only when I hit the ground
It causes all the grief

// Are You Hurting The One You Love? //

Are you hurting the one you love?
You say you've found Heaven but you can't find God.
Are you hurting the one you love?
Bite your tongue till it tastes like blood.

Are you hurting the one you love?
So many glasses on the tabletop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough.

Tough,
It's just too tough.
Tough,
It's just too tough.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When they watched the walls, and the ticking clock.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And was it something you could not stop.

Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And lost for themselves.

Are you hurting the one you love?
And if heaven knows then who will stop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough.

// Addicted To Love //

The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is all it takes

You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Whoa, you would like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh, yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You're gonna have to face it—you're addicted to love

You see the signs, that you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine,

A one-track mind, you can't be saved
'Cause baby your love is all you crave
If there's some left, left for you
Then you don't mind if you do

Whoa, you would like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh, yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You're gonna have to face it—you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [5x]

The lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats, your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

Whoa, you would like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh, yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You're gonna have to face it—you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [8x]

// Bird Song //

Well I didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by.
Saw what I'd done. He set up a nest outside,
and he sang about what I'd become.
He sang so loud, sang so clear.
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear,
So I invited him in, just to reason with him.
I promised I wouldn't do it again.

But he sang louder and louder inside the house,
And no I couldn't get him out.
So I trapped him under a cardboard box.
stood on it to make him stop.
I picked up the bird and above the din I said
"That's the last song you'll ever sing".
Held him down, broke his neck,
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget.

But in my dreams began to creep
that old familiar tweet tweet tweet

I opened my mouth to scream and shout,
I waved my arms and flapped about.
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout,
couldn't scream and I couldn't shout.

I opened my mouth to scream and shout
waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream I couldn't shout,
The song was coming from my mouth.
From my mouth,
From my mouth,
From my mouth.

From my mouth,
From my mouth,
From my mouth,
From my mouth.

From my mouth.
From my mouth.
From my mouth.
From my mouth.

From my mouth,
From my mouth,
From my mouth,
From my mouth.

// Hospital Beds //

There's nothing to do here
All just lie and complain
In bed at the hospital
Coming and going
Asleep and awake
In bed at the hospital

I've got one friend
Laying across from me
I did not choose him
He did not choose me
We have no chance
Of recovering
Laying in hospitals
Joy and misery
Joy and misery
Joy and misery

Put out the fire boys
Don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us

Put out the fire boys
Don't stop, don't stop
Put out the fire on us

Bring your buckets by the dozen
Bring your nieces and your cousins
Oh, put out the fire on us

Bring your buckets by the dozen
Bring your nieces and your cousins
Oh, put out the fire on us

I've got one friend
Laying across from me
I did not choose him
He did not choose me
We have no chance
Of recovering
Laying in hospitals
Joy and misery
Joy and misery
And joy and joy and joy and joy and joy and joy and misery.

// Hardest Of Hearts //

There is love in your body but you can't hold it in
It pours from your eyes and spills from your skin
Tenderest touch leaves the darkest of marks
And the kindest of kisses break the hardest of hearts

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

There is love in our bodies and it holds us together
But pulls us apart when we're holding each other
We all want something to hold in the night
We don't care if it hurts or we're holding too tight

There is love in your body but you can't get it out
It gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
Sticks to your tongue and it shows on your face
That the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste

Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But you'll never know what a fool I've been
Darling heart, I loved you from the start
But that's no excuse for the state I'm in

The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts
The hardest of hearts

My heart swells like a water at weight
Can't stop myself before it's too late
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to take you
Hold on to your heart
'Cause I'm coming to break you

Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
The hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on)
The hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on)
The hardest of hearts (hold on)
