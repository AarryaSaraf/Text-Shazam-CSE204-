Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
She's born to be bad, so run for the hills
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me the thrill

Who wants to be nice?
Who wants to be tame?
All of your good guys, they all seem the same

Original, criminal, dressed to kill
Just call me Cruella de Vil

Call me crazy, call me insane
But you're stuck in the past
And I'm ahead of the game

A life lived in penance
It just seems a waste
And the devil has much better taste

And I tried to be sweet
I tried to be kind
But I feel much better now that I'm
Out of my mind...

Well, there's always a line to the gates of hell
But I go right to the front 'cause I dress this well
Rip it up, leave it all in tatters
Beauty is the only thing that matters

The fabric of your little world is torn
Embrace the darkness
And be reborn

Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me the thrill
