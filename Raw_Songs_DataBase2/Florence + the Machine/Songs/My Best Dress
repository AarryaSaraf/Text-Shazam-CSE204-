When your life is over I won't be sad or bluer
I'll put on my fancy hat, lie down next to you
I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress

You look so angry when you sleep, your face a troubled frown
So I will smooth your furrowed brow as I lay in the ground
I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
I'll hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress

And as the mourners pass me, I will smile and wave
Thank them for their sympathy and tell them I'll be brave
But once the wake is over, and I'm drunk and feeling fine
I'll go out there and find me another boy to pass the time

As we're dancing cheek to cheek and the lights are laid low
I'll request this song for you, laying in the ground below
Once the song is over, it's time to go to bed
I'll leave him on the dance floor and return to you instead

I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
I'll hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress
