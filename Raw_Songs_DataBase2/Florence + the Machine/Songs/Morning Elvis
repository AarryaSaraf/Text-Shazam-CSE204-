When they dressed me and they put me on a plane to Memphis, well
I never got to see Elvis
I just sweated it out in a hotel room
But I think the king would have understood
Why I never made it to Graceland
The bathroom tiles were cool against my hand
I pressed my forehead to the floor and prayed for a trapdoor
I've been here many times before
But I've never made it to Graceland

And if I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

Well, pick me up in New Orleans
Pinned in a bathroom stall
Pick me up above my body
Press my corpse against the wall
I told the band to leave without me
I'll get the next flight
And I'll see you all with Elvis
If I don't survive the night

If I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

And after every tour, I swear I'll quit
It's over, boys, now this is it
But the call, it always comes
And the songs like children
Begging to be born
But, oh, I guess I got my wish
But anything, anything, anything but this

If I make it to the mornin'
I should've come with a warnin'
But if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved
Oh, you know I'm still afraid
I'm still crazy and I'm still scared
But if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be spared

To be spared
To be spared
To be spared
To be spared
