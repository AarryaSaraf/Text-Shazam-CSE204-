Are you hurting the one you love?
You say you've found Heaven but you can't find God.
Are you hurting the one you love?
Bite your tongue till it tastes like blood.

Are you hurting the one you love?
So many glasses on the tabletop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough.

Tough,
It's just too tough.
Tough,
It's just too tough.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When they watched the walls, and the ticking clock.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And was it something you could not stop.

Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.
Stop,
Could not stop.

Are you hurting the one you love?
When you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground.
Are you hurting the one you love?
And lost for themselves.

Are you hurting the one you love?
And if heaven knows then who will stop.
Are you hurting the one you love?
You said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough.
