No walls
Can keep me protected
No sleep
Nothing inbetween me and the rain
And you can't save me now,
I'm in the grip of a hurricane
I'm gonna blow myself away

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else,
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse

No home,
I don't want shelter
No calm,
Nothing to keep me from the storm
And you can't hold me down
'Cause I belong to the hurricane
It's gonna blow this all away

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse

I hope that you see me
Cause I'm staring at you
But when you look over
You look right through
Then you lean and kiss her on the head
And I never felt so alive, and so... dead.

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out, woah-oh-o

I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
Cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going o-o-o-o-o-o-out
I'm going out, woah-oh-o
I'm going out
