Ever since I was a child
I've turned it over in my mind
I sang by that piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried

And I don't wanna see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come, come

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you

On this champagne, drunken hope
Against the current, all alone
Everybody, see, I love him

'Cause it's the feeling that you get
When the afternoon is set
On a bridge into the city

I don't wanna see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry

'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it, I'll get around it
'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from that piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you

Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you

Cry and cry and cry and
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and cry

(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)

(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)

I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes

I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
