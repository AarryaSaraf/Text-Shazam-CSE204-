I built a man made out of bricks
And lived inside his chest
I beat my head against the wall
To make a heartbeat in his breast
I smashed my fists against his ribs
To suck the air inside
And swing by swing and blow by blow
I brought that man to life

I built a man and cut his skin
And lived inside his heart
I pumped it with my fingertips
And loved it from the start
And with every beat I gave it
A heartbeat of my own
And filed his veins with the blood I had
'Till his blood, 'till his blood
'Till his blood was my own

I would build you up
But we're not made of the same stuff
And even though I knocked you down
You're so much stronger than me

Well I would build you right up
But we're not made of the same stuff
And even though I knocked you down
You're so much stronger than me
