I was looking for a breath of life
For little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

But I needed one more touch
Another taste of heavenly rush
And I believe, I believe it's so


And I needed one more touch
Another taste of divine rush
And I believe, I believe it's so

Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?
Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?

And the fever began to spread
From my heart down to my legs
But the room is so quiet

And although I wasn't losing my mind
It was a chorus so sublime
But the room is too quiet
(the fever)

I was looking for a breath of life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"
(fever)


To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"


And the fever dream of life
And the chorus so sublime
And the room was too quiet

It's a harder way and it's come to claim her
And I always say, we should be together
I can't sleep alone, 'cause there's something in here
And if you are gone, I will not belong here
(belong, belong, belong)

And I started to hear it again
But this time it wasn't the end
And the room is so quiet

And my heart is a hollow plain
For the devil to dance again
But the room is too quiet

I was looking for a breath of life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"
