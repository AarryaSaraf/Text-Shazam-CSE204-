Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?
Alright, look, look, look, look, look
Just in case you ain't got it by now
Listen to me, bring it in
If you are alive
I know you ain't reach your best yet
You got more, you could do more
You could see more, you could be more, alright?

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look

Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearing me?

Ah-ha!

Now we gon' take it to another level

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look
Ah!

A lot of you, you're not where you wanna be
You thinking of negative stuff
You talking negativity
You in that negative zone
I need you to do me a favour
I need you to know that
In order for you to get to that next level
The one thing you need to do
To go where you've never gone before
Is to change the way you think

Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearing me?

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look
Ah!
