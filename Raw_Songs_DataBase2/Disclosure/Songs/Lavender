I change the channel on you
I'm on it
I like the lace on you
She about it
Soft lips, soft skin, smooth hips, want everything
And you got it

Get closer, baby
I need you in my life
Lady
Get closer, baby
You're the type I like
Baby

No turning back now
Ooh, got it
Get it, got it, then I got it good
I'm about it, they're misunderstood
Girl
She be fuckin' with my rhythm
She be fuckin' with my rhythm
Damn

She addicted to groove
That's how I get her
I set my sight and then move
I'm better
I see her look, double take, hear me say
"Now let me see you shake"
It's now or never

Get closer, baby
I need you in my life
Lady
Get closer, baby
You're the type I like
Baby

I change the channel on you
I'm on it
I like the lace on you
Care about it
Soft lips, soft skin, smooth hips, want everything
And you got it

Get closer, baby
I need you in my life
Lady
Get closer, baby
You're the type I like
Baby

High nights under lights
I'm addicted to you
Same game, different rules

High nights under lights

I'll be the best you

High nights under lights
