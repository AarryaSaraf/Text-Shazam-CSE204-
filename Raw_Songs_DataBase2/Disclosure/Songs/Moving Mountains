I can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm depending on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm depending on

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love

Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love

Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Feels like I'm
It feels like I'm
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
