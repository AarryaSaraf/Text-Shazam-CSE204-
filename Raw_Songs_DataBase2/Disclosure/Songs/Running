Keep me running, you keep me running...

I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you

Whoa, would you hold my hand lightly ever so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us

I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you
You keep me, keep me running, me running

And I'm lost again, it's keep happening
But when I'm around you,
when I'm around you
I just go weak
And I wanna know, is it mutual
Am I'm ready to run, am I ready to fall?
I think I'm just ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you
