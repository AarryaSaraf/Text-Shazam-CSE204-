Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', yeah

Started off right, I could see it in your eyes
I could tell that you wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me something I ain't heard before
Ooh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on, so stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', oh now
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock
Ooh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can't we just talk? (Ooh)
Can't we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'
