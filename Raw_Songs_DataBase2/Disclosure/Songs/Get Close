You think, you talk but don't do
You stress, you stop, don't move
You think, you talk but don't do
You stress, you stop, don't move

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

You think, you talk but don't do
You stress, you stop, don't move
(M-m-man, cut this shit off)

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

(M-m-man, cut this shit off)
(You don't rap like that)
