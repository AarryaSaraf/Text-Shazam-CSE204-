I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
Sitting home on this lonely night
With nothin' much to do
I remember the good times
When they all were spent with you
How I long to see you smile
And to dance the night away

I wanna be with you..whoa


Cause I feel like laughin'
..let's laugh together
Cause I feel like singin'
..let's sing forever
Cause I feel like dancin'
..let's dance together

Find a hideaway..getaway for two

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
Hey I sure think the time is right
I've got so much in store

Cause I just wanna be with you
And do the things we did before
Don't wanna seem like I'm begging you
But I think tonight's the night
Why can't I be with you



Can I slip away..faraway with you

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me

I'll play the music

Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah
Do dah do dah yeah

I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
I'll play the music
Won't you come dance with me
