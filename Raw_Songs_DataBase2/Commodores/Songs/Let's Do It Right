Walking along
Trying to live our lives
Confused as we are
All trying to find our guiding star (Yeah)
Life's but a dream
For the time we spend here, that's what it seems
But you got to be strong
You got to know what's right and what's wrong
Oh, it's plain to see
We're not all the things we'd like to be
And if we had to live our lives all over

Let's do it right, now baby
We'll try the same things that we did before
But let's do it right this time baby
We'll do the same things that we did before (All right)

Love can be fun
Only if you got the right someone
How you can know, if she'll stay or if she'll go (Yeah)

Keep your head to the sky
We'll make a way for you by and by
Oh, it seems to me
Big strong men we all try to be (Yeah)
And if we had to live our lives all over

Let's do it right, now baby
We'll try the same things
Let's do it right, now baby
We'll do the same things

Let's do it right baby...
