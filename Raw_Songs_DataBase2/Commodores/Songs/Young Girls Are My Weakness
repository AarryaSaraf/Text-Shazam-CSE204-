Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

Hey girls let's mess around
I wanna party with you on the town
Some girls really make me swing
There ain't nothin' like a pretty young thing

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

Young girls are really mellow
You don't believe me then just try this fellow
(I know what to say when they call me on the phone)
You call me back when your dad leaves home

Young girls you make me move
Young girls you set the groove
Young girls sweet as honey
Young girls take all my money

(pretty girl what ya gonna do?)
I just wanna get me hands on YOU

Hey girls let's mess around

There ain't nothin' like a pretty young thing 

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

Young girls you make me move
Young girls you set the groove
Young girls sweet as honey
Young girls take all my money

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
