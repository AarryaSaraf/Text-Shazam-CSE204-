I may be just a foolish dreamer
But I don't care
Cause I know my happiness
Is waiting out there, somewhere

I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Whoa, I'd like to take just this moment
And dream my dream, whoa dream my dream

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind, oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I'd like to greet the sun each morning
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey
In my life, in my life

Well, I've shared so many pains
And I've played so many games
Ah, but everyone finds the right way
Somehow, somewhere, someday

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
People can be what they wanna be

Ooh, ooh...

Whoa, I wish the world were truly happy
Living as one
I wish the world they call freedom
Someday would come, some day would come, baby

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind can be fresh and clear
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Everybody can be what they wanna be
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, baby

(I-I-I-I) Zoom-zoom (baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)
I'd like to fly away (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom-zoom (well, I'd like to fly away)
Zoom (zoom, baby)

Zoom (I-I-I-I)
(Babe) Zoom-zoom (baby, yeah)
Zoom (you and me, baby)
(Walking free)
(Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go)
(Hey, yeah, babe, babe, babe, babe)
(Yeah)
(Don't you wanna go, don't you wanna go)
