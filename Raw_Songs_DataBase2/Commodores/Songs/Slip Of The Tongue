I'm feeling sorry for myself today
She threw me down off the wall around the fire
I knew exactly what I meant to say
She walked away and calling me a liar
Giving you the passion, burning like a flame
I don't know what maybe which was someone else's name

Slip of the tongue, from the like of me
I really didn't mean what I say
'Cause it's slip of the tongue, I don't understand
Something they will lose my head
It was the slip of the tongue
Don't she realize anyone could make a mistake?
But she don't even know (slip of the tongue)
She says she doesn't care (slip of the tongue)
She thinks I'm runnin' 'round but I swear
It was the slip of the tongue 

No way you treat me what is said and done
Careless words took away the building
I got the girl to believe it's true
It's gonna take worth a shout of a miracle
(Gonna take a miracle, a miracle)
Crazy situation, I got to find a way
I got the girl, but don't you believe what I say?

Slip of the tongue (slip) from the like of me
I really didn't mean what I say
'Cause it's slip of the tongue (slip) I don't understand
Something they will lose my head
It was the slip of the tongue (slip of the tongue)
Don't she realize anyone could make a mistake?
Slip of the tongue (slip, slip)
Come on, gimme a break
Slip of the tongue (slip, does it slip, slip, slip of the tongue)
Slip of the tongue (slip, does it slip, slip, slip of the tongue)
Slip of the tongue (slip)
Slip of the tongue (slip, slip, do you mean it, do you mean it)
