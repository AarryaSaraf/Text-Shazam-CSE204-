Saturday, but I've been living for the weekend, girl
To let all my inhibitions go wild, wild and free
Gonna get away into the night
Take the girl of my dreams
Don't you know we'll make sweet music?

Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right, whoo whoo

Girl, forget the memories of those bad times together
Let us live at love and make these moments unforgettable
Tonight will be full of ecstasy
'Cause it's Saturday night in our lives again

Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Saturday, Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Ooh

Tonight will be full of ecstasy
'Cause it's Saturday night in our lives again

Yeah, it's alright
(Saturday, Saturday night)
When it's Saturday, it's alright, yeah
(Saturday, Saturday night)
(Saturday)
Feels so good on a Saturday (Saturday) Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Saturday (Saturday) Saturday night
Feeling good vibrations, the time is right
Listen
