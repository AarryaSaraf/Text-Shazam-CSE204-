Album: Nightshift

// Animal Instinct //

On my back
You're on my track

I can feel you creeping up on me.
Such a hungry love on the hunt

Stalking through the night
We're running wild.
In your eyes I'm the prize

In the lion's den I can't get free.
Now we're alone
Don't let me go

'Cause you're bringing out the savage beast in me.

My scent's in the air
It's everywhere

I'm gonna be your prey tonight.
I've given up the chase
I'm ready to be tamed

So tonight you better use your

Animal instinct - oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight.
Animal instinct - come to me
I wanna be your primitive lover.

Set a trap
Then you attack

Bringing me to life with every bite.
A single touch is just enough to stir the animal inside of me.
Lost in your jungle
Weak from the heat

I'm gonna be your prey tonight
I won't hide anymore
Listen for the roar

I know tonight you're gonna use your
Animal instinct - oh baby

Let's set the beast free tonight...

A savage heart
Hungry for the touch

In the dark I'm ready for the hur
I hear the call
The call of the wild

Every night I need to feel your
Animal instinct -
Oh baby
Let's set the beast free tonight...

My scent's in the air
It's everywhere...
Animal instinct - oh baby

Let's set the beast free tonight...
Animal instinct - oh baby

Let's set the beast free tonight...
Animal instinct
Instinct

Instinct
Instinct
Instinct
Instinct.
Animal instinct
Instinct

Instinct
Instinct. instinct
Instinct.

// Nightshift //

Marvin, he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song, his heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds, and I still can hear him say
"Aw talk to me, so you can see, what's going on"
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Jackie, hey what'you doing now?
It seems like yesterday when we were working out
Jackie, you set the world on fire
You came and gifted us, your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up and we'll be there at your side
Say you will sing your songs forevermore

Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Gonna be some sweet sounds, coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud, I bet you'll pull a crowd
Gonna be a long night, it's gonna be all right, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift
Gonna miss your sweet voice, that soulful noise, on the nightshift
We all remember you, your songs are coming through
And at the end of a long day, it's gonna be okay, on the nightshift
You found another home, I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

// I Keep Running //

You got me wondering what to do
I can't believe it but it's true
I never fell in love again
Tonight I feel that I would fall in love with you

I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you

I don't want to be depending on
And I never needed anyone
I'm not the kind of guy to share
My life and dreams but you
Should make it seem like fun

I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (running) I keep hiding (oh hiding)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (just keep me running) I keep hiding (oh yes)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you

I keep running (keep running)
I keep hiding (and hiding)
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running (keep running)
I keep hiding (and hiding)
I keep wondering, girl, I don't know what to do
You got me running
You got me hiding (hiding)
You got me wondering, got to get away from you
You got me running (uh huh)
You got me hiding (oh yeah)
You got me wondering, what am I supposed to do?
I keep running, I keep hiding 
I keep wondering, got to get away from you
I keep running, I keep hiding 
I keep wondering, girl, I don't know what to do
You got me running, you got me hiding
You got me wondering, got to get away from you
You got me running, you got me hiding
You got me wondering, what am I supposed to do?

// Lay Back //

There comes a time when it's all on the line
Where is the road gonna lead?
Ooh, you just don't know if it's safe to let go
Am I the one that you need?

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"?
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight, I wanna come in

There are no walls you can build around your heart
Only to hide from the pain
We take a chance from the moment we start
Time to come in from the way

You gotta lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"?
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight

Destiny has written less in ending
Are we old enough to let it slip away? 
Open up, time to start depending
On the one you really need, baby, trust in me and lay back

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back (let it begin)
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"
Girl, it's real
Lay back tonight, I wanna come in

Lay back and let somebody into your love (to your love)
Lay back, oh
Don't they just feel "The Power of Love"
Girl, it's real
You got to lay back tonight, I wanna come in
Ooh, come on and lay back
(I want you to lay back)
Lay back and let me into your love
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
Come over, baby
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)
(I want you to lay back)
(Baby, lay back)

// Slip Of The Tongue //

I'm feeling sorry for myself today
She threw me down off the wall around the fire
I knew exactly what I meant to say
She walked away and calling me a liar
Giving you the passion, burning like a flame
I don't know what maybe which was someone else's name

Slip of the tongue, from the like of me
I really didn't mean what I say
'Cause it's slip of the tongue, I don't understand
Something they will lose my head
It was the slip of the tongue
Don't she realize anyone could make a mistake?
But she don't even know (slip of the tongue)
She says she doesn't care (slip of the tongue)
She thinks I'm runnin' 'round but I swear
It was the slip of the tongue 

No way you treat me what is said and done
Careless words took away the building
I got the girl to believe it's true
It's gonna take worth a shout of a miracle
(Gonna take a miracle, a miracle)
Crazy situation, I got to find a way
I got the girl, but don't you believe what I say?

Slip of the tongue (slip) from the like of me
I really didn't mean what I say
'Cause it's slip of the tongue (slip) I don't understand
Something they will lose my head
It was the slip of the tongue (slip of the tongue)
Don't she realize anyone could make a mistake?
Slip of the tongue (slip, slip)
Come on, gimme a break
Slip of the tongue (slip, does it slip, slip, slip of the tongue)
Slip of the tongue (slip, does it slip, slip, slip of the tongue)
Slip of the tongue (slip)
Slip of the tongue (slip, slip, do you mean it, do you mean it)

// Play This Record Twice //

Let's dance, 'cause it feels real good
Let your body groove and get down to what it is
Let's dance, 'cause it feels so nice
Tell that funky D.J. to play this record twice
Let's dance (let's dance) 'till tomorrow night (tomorrow night)
'Till it feels so good, 'till it feels so right
And girl (girl) for the man of spice (the man of spice)
Tell that funky D.J. to play this record twice

You should be having fun dancing worth every dime
But you're not out on the floor
Instead you're being so shy, girl, are you afraid?
But I'll be wanting something more

Let's dance (dance) 'cause it feels real good (feels real good)
Let your body groove and get down to what it is
Let's dance (dance) 'cause it feels so nice (feels so nice)
Tell that funky D.J. to play this record twice

Don't stop, you're estimating
Look at the time you're wasting
Dancing is reality, yeah
There ain't no doubt in my mind
You thought I like what you find
Now, come on, dance with me, yeah

Let's dance (dance) 'cause it feels real good (feels real good)
Let your body groove and get down to what it is
Let's dance (dance) 'cause it feels so nice (feels so nice)
Tell that funky D.J. to play this record twice

(Babe, you understand) Let's dance
Dance, dance...
Play this record twice

(Let's dance)

How can you sit there with this music goin' on?
I know you wanna dance, so let's get it on (let's get it on)
How can you groove when your body don't move?
Action for one, and shake your booty, girls

Let's dance (dance) 'cause it feels real good (feels real good)
Let your body groove and get down to what it is
Let's dance 'cause it feels so nice (feels so nice)
Tell that funky D.J. to play this record twice (record twice)

// Janet //

Mmm...hmm...hmm...mmm...hmm...mmm...
Mmm...mmm...

Tearin' me apart
Somehow I just joined in
She's playing with my heart
But Janet's so aware

And people tell me, "She keeps telling you lies"
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet
Oh, Janet

There could never be
Another girl like Janet
It's only her and me
Together on this planet

And people tell me, "She keeps telling you lies"
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh, yeah
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it
I believe in Janet

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet
Oh, Janet

Why can't they see
Without her there'd be
No reason to go on and on

As long as she stays with me
I'll keep holdin' on
I believe in Janet

I believe in Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet, Ja-Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on

Janet, they don't understand it
The whole thing must be wrong

// Woman In My Life //

The Woman in my Life

She's a Lover She's a Friend
and no matter what She's been 
She's the Woman in my Life

The Woman in my Life

She's the Woman in my Life
And looking in her Eyes
I can see the love has find the way
And I hope she'll always stay
So I can always say

Sometimes I wonder where I'll be without her Love
She means the world to me
Her gentle touch

She'll always be
A lover and a friend
But of all the things she is

Nobody else could ever take her Place

And when she's smiling
I know that Love has find his way
And I hope she'll always stay
So I can always say

She's the Woman in my Life
She's the Woman in my Life
