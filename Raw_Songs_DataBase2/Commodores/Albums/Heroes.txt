// Got To Be Together //

Girl, I gotta get next to you
Something makes me wanna hold you
And tonight I want to get on down
Let me show you how to do it
You just start to moving
Start to grooving
Shake your body to the music
You know you just blow my mind

Wanna make it last forever

Let us groove our lives in pleasure

// Old-Fashioned Love //

I'm in love with a plain old-fashion girl
She's the most beautiful person in the world

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep, ah, yeah
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me
{Love is for love} Oh {But only if it's meant to be}
Only if it's meant to be, baby

Yeah, hea, hea, I-I-I-I

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go
Because when we reach that star we both will know
{Love is for love} Ooh {And our love was meant to be}
Our love was meant to be, baby, ooh

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby
I know that you do it right
Do it, do it, do it to it, baby

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby
I know that you do, do
Do it, do it, do it right, baby

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby
(I want some lovin' tonight )
Do it, do it, do it (Some old-fashion love, baby)

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby
I want (Oh, say it), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby

Oh, yeah
Ah., yeah
Oh, yeah
Ah, yeah

Do it, do it, do it

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby

// Heroes //

Lookin' back through time we are in debt to the leaders
Angels of mercy everyone
Good folks who believe there is no good and evil
Fought long and hard until the battles are were won

Heroes make the sun rise in the mornin'
Heroes make the moon shine bright at night
Heroes make our lives a little stronger
In the soul of everyone he can be found

Give us an anchor or a rock to lean on
A captain to take us through the storm
What makes a soldier ride alone into battle
Can anybody tell me where he's coming from

He's that stranger on the street
He's that child who's at your feet
Searching for freedom and justice
You've seen him time and again, you know they only fight to win
They're the challengers evil and I'm glad we know them

Heroes make the sun rise in the mornin'
Heroes make the moon shine bright at night
Heroes make our lives a little stronger
All our fears go away when he's around

Ooh...
Ooh...
Ooh...ooh...yeah

Whoa, heroes make our lives a little stronger
If you look you'll surely see there's you and me

Ooh, heroes
I played on people

// All The Way Down //

You have broken me all the way down
Down upon my knees
And you have broken me all the way down
You'll be the last, you'll see

Some fight you gave
And I pushed you away
From me

And in the morning when you turn in
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me all the way down
You'll be the last, you'll see

And what chance have we got
When you've missed every shot
For me?

And in the morning when you turn in
I'll be out of reach
And in the darkness when you find this
I'll be far to sea

And you have broken me all the way down
You'll be the last, you'll see

// Mighty Spirit //

Early Sunday morning
Grandma would wake me and say
Get up, it's time for you to pray..yeah
Your breakfast is waiting
But first you gotta get up and dress
Today is Sunday, it's the lords day of rest

[Chorus:]
Get up!
You gotta find the spirit
Get up
and find find the mighty, mighty spirit

And when I would get to church
The Usher would take me to my seat
The Sisters up front would be keeping the beat
The Choir would be singing the song
And the Deacons would be humming along
A Sister jumped up and said I've been reborn
Oh yeah..

[Chorus]

And since then, a lot of time has passed
I finally found out what they meant at last
At last I found, the mighty mighty spirit
Oh yeah

Now every single morning
I wake my children and say
Get up! It's time for you to pray

...Daddy I'm tired, do I have to get up now
Get up! It's time for you to pray..yeah

[Chorus]

// Jesus Is Love //

Father
Help Your children
And don't let them fall
By the side of the road, mmm...mmm...

And teach them
To love one another
That Heaven might find
A place in their hearts

'Cause Jesus is love
He won't let you down
And I know He's mine forever
Oh, in my heart

We've got to walk on
Walk on through temptation
'Cause His love and His wisdom

And His words will be our salvation
Lift up our hearts
To be thankful and glad

He won't let you down
And I know He's mine
Deep down in my soul

Wherever it leads me

And talk with you
And do all the things you want me to do
