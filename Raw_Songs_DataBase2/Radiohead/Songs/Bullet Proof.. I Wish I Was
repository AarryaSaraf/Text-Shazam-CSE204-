Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I was bulletproof

Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bulletproof
Was bulletproof

So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead-fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bulletproof

And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof
