Supercollider
Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Coming up from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming up from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half-life
In an arc light
I'm a B-spin
Flip-flopping
I'm a pulse wave
Outstepping

I put the shadows back into their boxes

I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned
(Supercollider)
My illusions
(Dust in a moment)
I have dislodged
(Particles scatter)
My depressions
(Parting out from the soup)
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes

I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
