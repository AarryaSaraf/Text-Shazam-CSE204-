I find it hard
To drive your stupid car
I find it hard
'Cause I never get that far

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road

You got concrete eyes
But I cannot see your face
And I failed in life
'Cause you crushed me with your hands

And you put my brain in overload
I can't change gear
I cannot see the road, road
