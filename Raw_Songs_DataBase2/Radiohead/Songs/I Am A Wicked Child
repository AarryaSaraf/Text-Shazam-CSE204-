One, two, three, four

Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I've sinned and I am so confused
And I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

I am the devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk a crooked mile
Yet I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow
If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow, and not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart

Now I wake up in the night
It's tugging at my arms and legs like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus to radiate his light
To radiate his light
