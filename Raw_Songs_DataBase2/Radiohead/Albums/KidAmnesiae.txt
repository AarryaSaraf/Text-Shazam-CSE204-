// Like Spinning Plates ('Why Us?' Version) //

Why us?
Why not someone else? Why us?
The cameras are turning off
Our lights so run away

And this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down the muddy river

While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions-
A delicate balance

When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
Our bodies floating down a
Muddy river

[Extended outro:]
Why us?

// Fog (Again Again Version) //

There's a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done

How, how did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

// If You Say The Word //

If you're in a forest, out of your mind
Harpies in the branches breaking your arms
If you're stuck in rainbows of shattering glass
Where you miss the moment, watching it pass

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word

When you spend your life wishing on a twinkling star
When you forget how lucky you are
Buried in rubble, sixty foot down

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running

When you change your friends, like changing your clothes

If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
If you say the word, if you say the word
Then I'll come running
I'll come running

// Follow Me Around //

I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Comin' after me, yeah
Headlights on full-beam
Comin' down the fast lane
Comin' after me

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Blowin' holes in everythin'
Thatcher's children
See you on the way back down
Drooling looney tunes
Movin' in a swarm
Movin' in a swarm

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah

Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothin'
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink

You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah

// Pulk/Pull (True Love Waits Version) //

I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet

Don't leave
Don't leave

I'm not living
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

Don't leave
Don't leave

// The Morning Bell (In The Dark Version) //

(... kids in half)
(... kids in half)
(... kids in half)
