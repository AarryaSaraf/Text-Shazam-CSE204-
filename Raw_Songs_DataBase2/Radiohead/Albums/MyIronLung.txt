// The Trickster //

Rust in the mountains, rust in the brain
The air is sacred here in spite of your claim
Up on the the rooftops, out of reach
Trickster is meaningless, trickster is weak

He's talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

I wanted you so bad, that I couldn't say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad, that we couldn't say
These things fall apart

We're talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway

Truant kids, a can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from their chestnut tree
Long white gloves, police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is

Talking out the world, talking out the world

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

// Lewis (Mistreated) //

Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump
Changed shape to fit, in the end, you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey, don't do it, don't jump

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really mattered

We never noticed, we never understood
He just get crushed to fit, he never even smiled at the best
It's the best, it's the best day of your life

Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really matters
No, I swear, I swear, I swear

Oh, mistreated, a low corporate
Mistreated, a low corporate

I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about it
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis

// Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong //

I wrapped you inside of my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no one can touch me
Now that I'm held in your spell

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before, before, before

Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust

I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

// Permanent Daylight //

The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I don't exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
Is to carry on believing that we don't exist
It must be hard, hard
With your head on backwards

// Lozenge Of Love //

I am gone, everybody's raging
And these fruits, they still taste of poison

I won't be around
When you really need me

I can't sleep, why can't someone hold me?
I need warmth, our restless body cracks and moans

I won't have the strength
When you really need me

// You Never Wash Up After Yourself //

I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
And spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself

// Creep (Acoustic) //

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

And I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
When I don't belong here

Oh, oh

She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
