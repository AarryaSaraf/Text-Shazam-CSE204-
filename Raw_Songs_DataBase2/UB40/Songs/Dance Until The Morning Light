Wake up in the morning, pump this in your stereo
In your car or blaze this in your disco
People look confused, what is this yo
Hip-Hop, a little bit a Reggae in it

This one is for those who like the old school
They tried to hit on us in the school hall
Lets take it back to base and give it
Check this out, let me tell you how to do it


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light

Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light


Twist, shake, rattle n roll and keep it jiggy jiggy
All my girls them low and keep it freaky freaky
Let it loose. let it go when I spin it
Mister DJ, can you turn it up a little?

Get up off the wall and stop your posing
 stand there looking frozen
Come bust a move, the club is closing
Check this out now, let me tell you how to do it


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light

Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light


Break it down
This one is making me silly, it makes me jump around
Get down
People get on your feet; I don't want you sitting down
Break it down
Let's start the winding, start the grinding, let's just jump around
Get down
Cos good music always comes back around

Ask your grandmother and grandfather about this
How they were twisting and shaking when they first heard this
40 years later now they're back on the play list
We recycle it and now we're back in business


We put this back in the pot
And now we're stirring it up
We add the sugar and a spice
And now we're making it hot
And now we're running your city
And yes we're running your block

And we're never gonna stop, so just...


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light


Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
