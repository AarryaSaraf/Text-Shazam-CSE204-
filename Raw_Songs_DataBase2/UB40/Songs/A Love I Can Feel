I want a love I can feel
Thats the only kind of love I think is real
Don't wanna be going by something I heard
Coz baby actions speak louder than words

I want the love that is mine
In rain and snow and sun sun sun shine
A love to keep me warm when it's cold
That kind of loving that will never grow old

Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love

I want a love I can feel
That kind of loving you can give to me
The kind of kisses that can really be felt
That kind of loving that can make me melt

Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
