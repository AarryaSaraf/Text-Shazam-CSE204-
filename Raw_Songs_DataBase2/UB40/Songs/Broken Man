Broken tears running down my face
Broken heart beating out of pace
Broken dreams shattered on the ground
Broken words, no words to be found!

Broken promises lost on the wind
Broken life broken from within
Broken love money just can't buy
Broken world, passing each one by

Broken smile fading like the sun
Broken man who's loving no one
Broken song that no one will sing
Broken forever, lost everything

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
My still heart's broken!

Broken tears running down my face
Broken heart beating out of pace
Broken dreams shattered on the ground
Broken words, no words to be found!

Broken promises lost on the wind
Broken life broken from within
Broken love money just can't buy
Broken world, passing each one by

Broken smile fading like the sun
Broken man who's loving no one
Broken song that no one will sing
Broken forever, lost everything

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live

We living in isolation
So it set from day one
Even family members dem
No have no communication
What a situation
'Nuff no have no education
Taken from our homeland
We need some reparation
To stop the starvation
Of the population
Looking for elevation
'Nough run to the congregation
In need of meditation
Mental stimulation
Herbal medication
To stop the inflammation
I'm spreading information
To each and every nation
What a tribulation
Inna dis iration
We yodding from creation
We don't need no immigration
Break down the boarders 'dem
That we all a wait 'pon
Lord

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
My still heart's broken!
