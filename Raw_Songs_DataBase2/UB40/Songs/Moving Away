In every part of me I can feel you're moving away baby
I can feel you're moving away darling
More every day in every way
Deep down inside of me

I can feel I'm losing you baby
I can feel I'm losing you darling

Why are you going away yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeaaah

Deep down inside of me
I can feel I'm losing you baby

I've got the loving you need every night
I've got the power so
Why are you going away yeah yeah yeah yeah
You're moving away
