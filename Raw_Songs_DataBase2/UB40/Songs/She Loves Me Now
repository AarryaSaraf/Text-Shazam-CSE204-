She loves me now
And that just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same

Listen now
Early one Sunday morning
As I took up my paper and decided to read
The phone rang with a little voice saying

"You might not remember me but I had one dance with you
And ever since the night we met, I must tell you true
You danced into my life, drove me out of my mind
Now between me and my man it's all over"

That's what she said
"I just want us now to get closer"
She loves me now
That just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same

I knew something special would have to come out
'Cause the way with the woman there was no doubt
We would have to see eachother and it would not be long
Before we'd hit it off with a love that's strong, strong, strong

And I know someone out there is hurt, but got to get it on
It's natural that we were meant for each other
If you run your life the way you dance
I'd be proud of that night I made my advance

She loves me now
And that just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same
She loves me now
After the night we danced on the floor
She loves me now
