In our youthful condemned nation
The truth speaks for itself
That in a time of darkness
Someone cried for help
So we told a simple story
Of innocence and lies
How the truth became so twisted
In a single judge's eye

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand

It all seemed very simple
Let the guilty take the blame
We can sing our songs of freedom
And put them all to shame
Shine a light into the dark
Let them hear his name
But the more we try to change things
The more they stay the same

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand

No one else but Tyler
Knows exactly what he's missed
He's a man that's disappearance
Is slowly ceasing to exist
And the only contribution
That he has left to give
Is the simple tragic story
Of the life he's never lived

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand
