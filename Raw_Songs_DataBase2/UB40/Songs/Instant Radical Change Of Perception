It's the stuff we think we know
That stops us all from learning
It's the wood that needs to grow
That keeps your fires burning

You can educate a fool
You can wrap him up in learning
You can read him all rules
But you can never make him think


With an instant radical change of perception
A hundred and eighty degrees in direction
Inoculate against the infection
And set a new course on a brand new trajection
In a brand new direction

It's the greenhouse that we're heating
That makes tomorrow colder
And doomsday drums are beating
A tattoo upon your shoulder

You can educate a fool
He could be a title holder
You could read him all the rules
But you can never make him think


With an instant radical change of perception
A hundred and eighty degrees in direction
Inoculate against the infection
And set a new course on a brand new trajection

In a brand new direction
A change of perception
On a brand new trajection
