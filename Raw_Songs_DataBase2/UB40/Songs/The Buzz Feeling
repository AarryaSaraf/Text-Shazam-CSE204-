Well the man like general slinger
Sa live the life you love and love the life you live
Cause what is in my hart is design to give
But special request is to all back stabber should be stuck in asieve
When I and I smoke senisman give thanks and praise to the full causes whot


The buzz feeling lord
Well have you ever had the buzz feeling my sisthren
Have you ever had the buzz feeling
My brethren

Have you ever had the buzz feeling you take out you rizla
You start rolling seh three or five sheet me
Seh what you deeling with you take piece of cigarette
Start breaching open up you giangi bag you start
Sprinkling you stick out you tongue and you start fe licking
You lean against a speaker box take you matches lighting
Seh man have you ever had the buzz feeling



When your head is spinning you knees wobbling you belly rolling
And your eyes shutting fe you head would of blow off
Like a car engine most people in the dance dem start laughing
Some of them cannot explain mysterious feeling so you sit on de stair
Gaze pon de ceiling you hand pon you belly
You start fe rubbing a little after that you a little vomiting
So you run down the stairs like a streak of lightening you move
Through the crowd like you hustling you brethen
Shout you start reasoning about thing and time and the flat
Him move in the operatir play a tune them start bubbling
It make it even harder fe you passing as you reach out side start
Slow breathing you sit pon de wall and start thinking never again
Would I get that feeling dread



Well you head stop spinning you knees stop wobbling you belly stop roll
Start crave fe dumpling



You I dren shout you roll up a splif
Me I dren temptation it is graet but
Remember that funny feeling



But wen me seh you shouldn't rump with the general
Shouldn't rump with the general

Me seh don't rump with general
Don't play with the general
Don't fool with the general
Don't walk with the general
Don't talk with the general
Don't eat eith the general
