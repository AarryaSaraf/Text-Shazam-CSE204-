Can you dig it, alright I can dig it
Cause I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat
Yes I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat

I want the girls to hear me rap
Cause this mc has got the nack
I'm your body-popping shell shocking
Girls hocking eye popping lick me all over like a lollipop
I'm your juicy fruit
Alright, alright, alright

I said hey white man, indian or black
I'm your number 1 MC and that's a fact
I'm a goodlooking, girl hooking outstanding
Mike chatting lyrical shock attack
All MCs freeze there on the spot
One false move and you must get drop
I'm always devastating, fascinating
Vibemaking, painstaking, watch it man I'm hot



Its a struggle in life when your skin is black
The system is designed to hold you back
how sya do shake hands on the shoulder a pat
One love to my face then a stab in the back
Seven points in snooker when you put down the black
But I still thank God for the little I got



I don't stop rapping to the musical beat
And I'm in the mood to turn you on
In the groove thats so complete
Wind you hips, shake your body
Or clap you hands even stamp your feet
Just like a bed thats just been spread
You know I'm neat, neat, neat
Just like a tap that's running hot
Man can't you feel the heat
Not just now but every minute every hour Everyday and every week

I don't give a hoot for loot and shoot
Or prostitutes in skin tight suits
Standing on the corner
They call their beat
I'm not a pimp drug pusher
Gambler or even thief
To the teachers I will preach
And to the teachers I will teach
Cause I'm a hip hop lyrical robot
That is why so unique
Well police and theives are playing
The game of hide and seek
When an imformer gives imformation
Then its called a leak
I jail your a number ruled by govenor
Screws keep you under, wanna see you blunder
When they say "Sit" just take a seat
And when they say "food" it's time to eat
If a screw says "Nigger" I don't answer
"Yes Sir, no Sir three bags full Sir"
Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler
Me a growler, I'm no growler



Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot
I don't stop rapping to the musical beat
Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat
