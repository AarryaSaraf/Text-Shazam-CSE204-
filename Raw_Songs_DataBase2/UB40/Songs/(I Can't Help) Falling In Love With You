Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Wise men say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay would it be a sin
But I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you

As the river flows
Gently to the sea
Darling so we go
Some things were meant to be

Take my hand take my whole life too
But I can't help falling in love with you

I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
I can't help falling in love with you
