Hey Folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
Mek you go long so.
Hey folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
Mek you go long so.

You come chatty chatty chatty run up you' mouth; 
One man, one vote you hear from the shout. 

You full of pure promise but you tell damn' lies; 
You make a mistake And then somebody dies. 

Hey folitician, me seh hey folitician
Me seh hey folitician
What you doin 'bout the slums?
You sit around all day, jus' a twiddle your thumbs;
You have a strange expression
Mek you look like you' dumb. 

You worry everybody 'til you put them in a box. 

Dub freak gone
Gone go check him record shop,
Gone go check him record stock.

Him climb upon the box
Him said him got to reach the top;
Him climb upon the shelf
Him seh you take care yourself.
Him dance upon the floor
Him said a music galore. 

Dub freak, dub freak
Deh 'pon the go;
Say you never know
Because I told you so.

Sippa, sippa, sippa, sippa, lightning crash; 
Drummer 'pon him drum, him jus' a play mish-mash. 
Keyboards in the middle jus'a jump and twiddle. 
Rhythm over here an' me seh rhythm over there;
Don't stop and stare because the rhythm gone clear.

Dub freak, dub freak, in a dub freak style
Dub freak, dub freak, still a running wild.
Him start from the bottom 'til him reach up the top
Him keep on rocking and him never stop.
Wow and flutter, music just a run like butter. 

Dub a slip an' slide
Dub a slip an' slide
Dub a slip an' slide,
He can't find nowhere to hide.
