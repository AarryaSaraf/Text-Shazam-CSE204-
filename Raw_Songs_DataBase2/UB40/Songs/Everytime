In a little while
I'll be on my way
Got no words to express
What I need to say


Every time I think about the first time
We said hello
You know when you know
You never let go

It's just not my style
Something I can't do
After all this time
I'm scared of losing you



Is there anything
You could let me know
Surely you could find me
A reason not to go



After everything
We've been going through
I'm so up and down
So dizzy and blue



Let me one more time
Look into your eyes
I remember when
There were no goodbyes
