Like a long lonely stream I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun where there's hope for every one
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun where there's hope for every one
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun
