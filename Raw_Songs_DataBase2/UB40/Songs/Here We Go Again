We've lost our way and don't know which way to turn
Here we go again
We put trust in great man and still we get burnt
Here we go again
Why do we fall for the same old lines?
Why do we fall for it time after time?
We've lost our way inadvertently

So dark that we can't see

I'm talking you and me
You've lost your pride and don't know when it began
Here we go again
You sit in judgement over your fellow men
Here we go again
Why do you fall for the same old lines?
Why do you fall for it time after time?
You've lost your pride inadvertently
To scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
Too scared to run to me
To scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
Too scared to run to me
We've gone too far and don't know where it will end
Here we go again
We've eaten up nature
And were gonna get burned
Here we go again
Why do we choose to leave no warning signs?
Why do we do it time after time?
We've gone to too far inadvertently
No where to run as far as I can see
Nowhere to run
No end for you and me
Too scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
To scared to run to me
To scared to to scared to to scared to talk
To scared to to scared to to scared to talk
