Don't you give me your hard luck story
I don't care now you voted for me
I know austerity's breaking your back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't complain that there's no state housing
I've bought mine made a profit of thousands
There's not many left but I can't help that
But I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
You're struggling I know but even so
I'm sick of hearing you whine

Don't you tell me you can't get a house
I've got two and I'm renting one out
Ok private landlords are holding you back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't start moaning I don't pay taxes
All of my scams they are legal practise
I'm entitled you can't have it back
And I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
Your struggling I know but even so
You don't have to moan all the time

Hey Mr MP how you a gwarn so
You dun know your job is to feed the people
How come you a feed off of the people
Selassie I know your time coming rude boy
Some questions for you answer ya know
Big and too rich man cha

It must be nice to be able to the buy house where you want
It must be nice to be able to the buy car where you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the flight where you want
And fly around the world and do what ever you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the hotel where you want
Nice to be able to the call the cab when you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the best restaurant
And eat and drink whatever you feel for and want

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
You're struggling I know but even so
I'm sick of hearing you whine

Don't you tell me you can't get a house
I've got two and I'm renting one out
Ok private landlords are holding you back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't start moaning I don't pay taxes
All of my scams they are legal practise
I'm entitled you can't have it back
And I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
