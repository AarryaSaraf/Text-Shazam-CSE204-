Mankind must put an end to war
Or war will end Mankind.
Ask just who your fighting for
And who's the mastermind.
Question what we're doing here
How long can we sustain,
The guilt that feeds upon our fear
We've only got ourselves to blame.

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day. CHORUS
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

And once again we find ourselves
Upon the field of War
It seems like all our yesterdays
Are on repeat But furthermore,
It would appear we did'nt learn
The lessons of our past,
The war we fought to end all wars,
Secured a Peace that did'nt last

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

Mankind must put an end to war
Or war will end Mankind.
Ask just who your fighting for
And who's the mastermind.
Question what we're doing here
How long can we sustain,
The guilt that feeds upon our fear
We've only got ourselves to blame.

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .
