This is how it is
This is how it goes
You come into this world alone
And travel down this road
You try to do the best you can
But there's no guarantees
So one day you'll be flying high
The next down on your knees


I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

This is what's it's like
And how it is to choose
Were you stop along the way
And fix your worn out shoes
How to recognise a girl
Avoiding all her mates
Forget the things you thought you knew
You may as well again


I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

This is how it goes, This is how it fairs
When all the world is falling down
And dragging at your hair
This is what they say
If you should ask them why
The world is in a backward spin
You fall, you live, you die


I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh


I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh
