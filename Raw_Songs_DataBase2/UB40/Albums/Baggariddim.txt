// The King Step //

To all the entertainers in the world I man show nuff respect
Nuff respect, cause every entertainer is select
And right ya now me a go show you how to do the king step

[Chorus:]
Me a go show you how to do the king step left right,
Me a go show you how to do the king step left right,

As soon as me operator puts the music on the deck
Is pure exciting, educating, fascinating, pirate chanting
Culture preaching, perfect timing lyrics you a go get
The whistlers blow their whistle, big women say "Kiss me neck"
Some bawl "Forward", some bawl "Rewind" and some shout out "eject"
While the pirates press record pon fe dem pocket size cassettes
The MCs that chat slack fret till dem armpit wet with sweat
Because they know that slackness is a thing I man do not respect
That's why me have to show dem how fe do the King Step Left Right.

[Chorus]

Well before me start to go down in a dais yak subject
Me have to praise you Jah cause you never fail I yet
Even when satan captured me and bring me close to death
You offered me the truth and right and I had to accept
But now me find you Jah me na go keep it secret
That's why the conscious lyrics are my favourite subject
Me chat dem in the blues party, pub, club and discotheque
Me chat dem in the bookie shop while man a put on bet
And also in the gambling house when man ready fe set
And even to bad man who a walk wid dem ratchet
Me chat dem a UB40 Studio in Digbeth
And when dem want more culture dem a bawl out "Dep, Dep, Dep"
But me tell them, hold on lads you ain't heard nothing yet
"Cause now I'm gonna show ya how to do the King Step" Left Right

[Chorus]

Left right its time to walk in the light of Jah not darkness
Left right who Jab bless no man curse, who Jah curse no man bless
Left right eternal life for the man that tries his very best
Left right do bad and you'll go down in the pit that's bottomless
Left right Pato Banton has now come to preach the right
Left right left right me no partial if your black or if your white
Left right well now me know how fe do the king step
Me just can not keep it a secret
So right ya now you a get
THE KING STEP THE KING STEP THE KING STEP

Step 1, we all should know that there's one god and only one
Step 2, Is give him praises for this whole creation
Step 3, Is love your brother man cause you and him is one
Step 4, Is not to make the same mistake as Soloman
Step 5, Is to repent and beg forgiveness for your wrongs
Cause the wrath of Jah is clear to see in Revelation
So make up mind if you want to go to Heaven or Hell
Step 6, Oh yes there's more the King Step carries on
It carries on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Step 6, is once you know the truth to pass the message on
And do the King Step daily as you trod upon Jah land
So when the right time comes for Babylon's destruction
You'll be among the few to march towards mount Zion
Left-Right, Left-Right, Left-Right, Left-Right

// The Buzz Feeling //

Well the man like general slinger
Sa live the life you love and love the life you live
Cause what is in my hart is design to give
But special request is to all back stabber should be stuck in asieve
When I and I smoke senisman give thanks and praise to the full causes whot

[Chorus:]
The buzz feeling lord
Well have you ever had the buzz feeling my sisthren
Have you ever had the buzz feeling

Sprinkling you stick out you tongue and you start fe licking
You lean against a speaker box take you matches lighting
Seh man have you ever had the buzz feeling

[Chorus]

When your head is spinning you knees wobbling you belly rolling
And your eyes shutting fe you head would of blow off
Like a car engine most people in the dance dem start laughing
Some of them cannot explain mysterious feeling so you sit on de stair
Gaze pon de ceiling you hand pon you belly
You start fe rubbing a little after that you a little vomiting
So you run down the stairs like a streak of lightening you move
Through the crowd like you hustling you brethen
Shout you start reasoning about thing and time and the flat
Him move in the operatir play a tune them start bubbling
It make it even harder fe you passing as you reach out side start
Slow breathing you sit pon de wall and start thinking never again
Would I get that feeling dread

[Chorus]

Well you head stop spinning you knees stop wobbling you belly stop roll
Start crave fe dumpling

[Chorus]

// Lyric Officer //

Why do you have to force yourself with power and control
Why do you have to live your life playing up a role
Intimidating people with your wall of sight and sound
You and your kind destroy our underground
All the happiness you destroy
All the brutal tactics that you always emply
All the fucking bullshit when will it ever stop
The comparison is obvious: you're a fucking cop
Officer - you act like an animal, you're out of control
Officer - what the hell is wrong with you
Wear a tie if you want to wear a uniform
Join the army if you want to conform
Tough guy asshole do what you can
Whatever you destroy we'll create it again

// Demonstrate //

Well Jerry at de mike come fe Demonstrate
Yes, Jerry at de mike me come fe Demonstrate
Me come fe show de crowd a people dat great is great
Right ya now Mr Jerry at go set tings straight
No MC test Jerry in a ATE
So listen dem ya styles I man originate
First of all me wan you know me na exaggerate
All pirate in de dance me would a evacuate
Is a whole leap a space I man accomodate
An a whole leap a gal I accumulate
Round de mile Jerry don't need no associate
Me chat by meself me no combinate
Me study very hard because me want graduate
Up de MC ladder I man Essulate
To be a boss MC I'm a chief candidate
True me fascinate nor irritate and me originate
Round de classic Micro-centre dat is where me locate
Me no select no tune an Jerry don't operate
Fe see me lift speaker - box you must fortunate
Cause asdedance down me gone home me gone go hibernate
Going home de other night me can't remember de date
De early hours of de morning before people a wake
Bopsing down de road it was me worst mistake
Police come draw down pon me an a investigate
Him say "Hey son where you coming from don't you know that it's late
I've heard about you niggers and the trouble you create"
I said "I'm coming from a party and me going home straight
Me just stop a de shop to buy some cigarette an chocolate"
When me explain de situation him stop interrogate
Turn around jump in a im panda car an say "See you mate!"
Is a good ting me never cheeky or be obstinate
Or me could a end up visiting de damn magistrate
De house way me live in you know it must decorate
An de girl way me love ave to affectionate
Nem ya linda lyrics you must penetrate
So listen every word I man and quotate
True me talking very clear you no need fe translate
Cause when me riding pon de riddim me no mek no mistake
Gasst contagious disease I man vaccinate
An true me no wan catch a dose me no fornicate
De lyrics way me chat dem must varinte
Some time me chat itslow sometime me accelerate
Dem ya kinds style you must appreciate
Nuff gal come to me a congratulate
Dem say "Jerry your so good looking can I have you portrait"
I say "Yes of course my darling but you know you have to wait"
Well dais a something I man have to state
A trollop is a woman with a whole heap a weight
Don't tell her to her face cause she will aggrovate
And if she sit down pon you you will suffocate
At de mile is nuff excitement I Jerry create
And you know that its not hard for me to exterminate
Any boy way come a dance an a duplicate
A style him get off a Saxon or a old yard tape
I say de lyrics way me chat dem must variate
An nuff people dem a say don't me impertinate
Any gal way me like we must be intimate
But me only make love when me in private

// Two In A One //

[Chorus:]
Intelligent, we chat intelligent
Intelligent, we chat intelligent

Jackpot is when you win plenty at money
Jail is a place I don't want to go
January the first month of the year
Jealose is when five women fancy
But John is the proper name fe a English man
Jockey is a profisnel horse rider
Me sah June is the sixth mounth of the year

[Chorus]

An jam is when you caint move in a party
Mi say England is a place that covered in snow
Man we drink the ribeana wi don't no like drink beer

// Hold Your Position //

Rasta, them style ya a just levelment Uncle seen
Hold me position, Just a hold me position

Go on, hold me position, just a hold me position

Just like Jesus Christ in the valley of decision
Devil come along and tru to deceive man through him
Got him plan from the older one
Him had to hold him position, had to hold him position yeh
Hold him position, had to hold him position

Well rhythm like this makes me and me daughter
Go down at the dance, bubble on the corner
When the rhythm is sweet, we a go hold tighter
Rub-adub like this makes you go one
So you hold your position
Say you hold you position aya
Hold your position, say hold your position

Things and time was a getting slow let off the rhythm
Let the good time roll
Don't bother go a slow and stay a back row
I man come to make the rhythm
Just a rock and flow, because me hold me position
Just a hold me position

Special request to 39 Acker Tree, Frontline, everyman on Kime

So you should hold you position
Yes, hold your position, aya
Hold your position, hold your position
Hold Your Position (cont'd) Stones

Skank steady, Skank Steady
I tell you rock the rhythm
You should skank down steady
You know you say, it heavier than lead
Kinda tougher than tough
You know that Jah, Jah covers
Since he stands over us
So hold your position
Hold your position
Move to the east, and you could a move to the west
Lyrics like this Jab know never go jest
Say chunk ice water say right to your chest
Intercity, outer city everywhere the best you better
Hold you position, just hold your position
Hold you position, say hold your position

Well rhythm like this is really so hot
Let off the vilse because a legal shot
Because we hold our position
Yes, we hold our position aya
Hold our position yes, hold our position

Hold on tight never let go

Hold your position, just hold your position
Hold your position a ya, just hold your position
Wah dat, hold your position
I say hold your position settle hold your position John
Hold you position Aunty, hold your position
Say hold your position go on
Hold your position, tell them rhythm so crucial

Just a hold me position, hold me position

// Hip Hop Lyrical Robot //

[Chorus:]
Can you dig it, alright I can dig it
Cause I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat
Yes I'm your hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat

I want the girls to hear me rap
Cause this mc has got the nack
I'm your body-popping shell shocking
Girls hocking eye popping lick me all over like a lollipop
I'm your juicy fruit
Alright, alright, alright

I said hey white man, indian or black
I'm your number 1 MC and that's a fact
I'm a goodlooking, girl hooking outstanding
Mike chatting lyrical shock attack
All MCs freeze there on the spot
One false move and you must get drop
I'm always devastating, fascinating
Vibemaking, painstaking, watch it man I'm hot

[Chorus]

Its a struggle in life when your skin is black
The system is designed to hold you back
how sya do shake hands on the shoulder a pat
One love to my face then a stab in the back
Seven points in snooker when you put down the black
But I still thank God for the little I got

[Chorus]

I don't stop rapping to the musical beat
And I'm in the mood to turn you on
In the groove thats so complete
Wind you hips, shake your body
Or clap you hands even stamp your feet
Just like a bed thats just been spread
You know I'm neat, neat, neat
Just like a tap that's running hot
Man can't you feel the heat
Not just now but every minute every hour Everyday and every week

I don't give a hoot for loot and shoot
Or prostitutes in skin tight suits
Standing on the corner
They call their beat
I'm not a pimp drug pusher
Gambler or even thief
To the teachers I will preach
And to the teachers I will teach
Cause I'm a hip hop lyrical robot
That is why so unique
Well police and theives are playing
The game of hide and seek
When an imformer gives imformation
Then its called a leak
I jail your a number ruled by govenor
Screws keep you under, wanna see you blunder
When they say "Sit" just take a seat
And when they say "food" it's time to eat
If a screw says "Nigger" I don't answer
"Yes Sir, no Sir three bags full Sir"
Sometimes inmates would even call me a growler
Me a growler, I'm no growler

[Chorus]

Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot
I don't stop rapping to the musical beat
Well I'm a hip hop lyrical robot and a real cool cat

// Version Girl (Sister V's Version) //

Dis a de start and not the finish na go deal it with ace
I like to ride up in the riddim wid de treble and the bass
Not a courtroom could a hold me cause they wouldn't have a case
So don't you hurry don't rush me no in a no haste
Me na go chat dais one fast ca a no race me a race
Cause Sis V de'pon deh mike I beg you keep up the pace
And who a star wid Mr T it's Hannibal, murdock and face
I'm sure you noticed on the mike that I am in the right place
I'm gonna chat it in a style and chat it in a grace
Eat good food drink good you know thats to my taste
Now make sure eat it drink it all off na make none go to waste
And who's aeoberti upon Falcon Crest you know him a chase
Se that the top of the crew Sis V I may seem
See that me deal wid realism get guided by all my dream
Now rasberry ripple as you know it is my favourite ice-cream
So when me step in a de dance in my gear I just gleam
I am the top mile women thats why I'm standing so keen
Don't wa fe hear no pirate chat ca dem no in a my team
Se dat me de pan level vibes so chatting this I`m the queen
Why don't you shake a leg why don't you rock and come in
Don't bother fight in a de dance don't want police an the scene
To sparkle all the polishing you'll have to use Mr Sheen
Incredible Hulk transformation gigantic and green
So when you look in a him face he stares at you really mean
I like to eat up my steak better make sure it lean
Just add some rice add some dumplin but leave out the bean
Me na go to resturant sit down and eat three course meal
Me a chat it verbally don't want it signed stampedor sealed
In a de old avengers starred Steed and Mrs Peel
Who Robbie Box that gambler on the programme Big Deal
This one is live and direct so you know it's for real
I don't respect dais ya system don't expect me to kneel
Cause Jesus Christ worked his miracle many man ham did heal

Ca man dem make out a flesh and robots made our of steel
They might can operate like man unlike man they can't feel
Don't bother mix with no informer cause on you they might squeal

Cas me se when you have a spliff you must kark it
And when you have a dog you must walk it
Cause it might just do a number two upon your carpet
You have to get down on your knee and begin to clean it
Well in a de White House Mr Reagan a sit
And when me go a nasa dema launch rocket
So when a got a needle save myself nine stitch
While Joan Collins she's starring as the super bitch
Now I'm not exactly poor but I'm certainly ain't rich
I'm gonna preach it right don't bother call me hypocrite
Don't want hear Tony Butler me no check fe critic
Ca when I get a curly perm Jahman just use a home kit
And if I'm forced to hear a pirate dash dem down a snake pit
Mak pirina knam dem tear them flesh bit by bit
Cause sister de'pon de mike and I have got nuff lyric
Jim Davidson teasing Plice with his catch phrase nick nich
Upon my wrist I wear a watch how does it go tock tick
And who is starring with Magnum Higgins TC and Rick
Cause Tony labour SDP Jahman dem all make me sick
Because dem na go get my vote ca me no vote for politic
A me a Sister V upon the mike coming through
Se me a top a de chart Jahman and top of the crew

// Mi Spliff //
