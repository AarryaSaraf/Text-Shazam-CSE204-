Album: LabourOfLoveII

// Here I Am (Come And Take Me) //

I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

I know it's you and me babe
That makes the world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus:]
Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, wont ya come and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart in two halves

Ooh I know it's you and me babe
That makes the world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down

[Chorus 2x]

// Tears From My Eyes //

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

I've done everything one man can do, girl
Said every word one man can say
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl
I'm missing you from day to day.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

I've done everything one man can do, girl
Said every word one man can say
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl
I'm missing you from day to day.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

Tears from my eyes keep on falling
cause you are leaving, leaving with another
Things that we've done together
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

// Groovin' //

I get my kicks from watching people
Running too and fro
And if you ask them where they're going
Half of the don't know
They're the ones who think I'm crazy
But they don't realize

That I'm just groovin', groovin'
Grooving out on life
I'm just groovin' ooh groovin'
groovin' till I die

I see a river flowing by me
Heading for the sea
I get a feeling deep inside me
It's so good to be free
I've got sunshine in the daytime
And moonlight every night
And I'm just groovin' ...... Etc

I see a river flowing by me
Heading for the sea
I get a feeling deep inside me
It's so good to be free
I've got sunshine in the daytime
And moonlight every night
And I'm just groovin' ...... Etc

That I'm just groovin', groovin'
Grooving out on life
I'm just groovin' ooh groovin'
groovin' till I die

// The Way You Do The Things You Do //

You got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
And baby you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

[Chorus:]
Well you could of been anything that you wanted to
I can tell
The way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

[Chorus]

You make my life so rich
You know you could've been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

[Chorus]

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks were minutes
You know you could have been an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a crook
And baby your so smart
You know you could have been a school book

[Chorus]

// Wear You To The Ball //

I'm gonna wear you to the ball tonight
Put on your best dress tonight

Did you hear what the man said baby
Well be your best 'cause this

So be wise and be changing, put on your best

// Wedding Day //

Where were you on our wedding day
I got the bad news that you went away
Where were you little girl I say
Where were you on our wedding day

Give me back my ring
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing

Where were you when I said I do
Everybody laughing at my fine new suit
Now were where you on our wedding day

Give me back my ring.
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing

Now where were you when I searched the town
I turned the whole neighbourhood up side down
Now where were you little girl I say.
Where were you on our wedding day

Give me back my ring
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing
Give me back my ring
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing

Where were you when I said I do
Everybody laughing at my fine new suit
Now where were you little girl I say.
Where were you on our wedding day

Give me back my ring
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing

Now where were you when I searched the town
I turned the whole neighbourhood up side down
Now where were you little girl I say.
Where were you on our wedding day

Give me back my ring
I ain't gonna let you keep a thing

// Sweet Cherrie //

I've got to find sweet cherry
She's gone away from home
I've got to find sweet cherry
She's left me all alone

Cherry, Cherry,
Don't go and leave me alone
Don't go and leave me alone

My thoughts are always with you
The emptiness leaves me blue
If you should ever desert me
Then life deserts me too

Cherry, Cherry,
Don't go and leave me alone
Don't go and leave me alone

When we were together, downtown
We would do things together, downtown
The first place I met you, downtown
There we could always be.

Cherry, Cherry,
Don't go and leave me alone
Don't go and leave me alone

// Stick By Me //

Stick by me and I'll stick by you
Stick by me and I'll stick by you

My life here on earth would be useless can't you see
If I didn't have you to stick by me
I love you darling and that's no lie
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
When you cry I cry too
Stick by me and I'll stick by you

Friends may try to hurt us
Scandalise our name
But no one (no-one) can tear us apart
You have a place in my heart

I love you darling and that's no lie
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
Remember my heart and love belongs to you
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
When you cry I'll cry too
Stick by me and I'll stick by you

Friends may try to hurt us
Scandalise our name
But no one (no-one) can tear us apart
You have a place in my heart

I love you darling and that's no lie
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
Remember my heart and love belongs to you
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
When you cry I'll cry too
Stick by me and I'll stick by you

// Impossible Love //

When we were together
Those were the happiest time in all my life
Now were separated I don't know what I will do
'Cause I can't ever love another
No matter how hard I try
'Cause I know. It's impossible,

Where ever you may be
I hope you'll hear my song
Then maybe you'll realise
My love that you were wrong

'Cause I can't ever love another
No matter how hard I try
'Cause I know. It's impossible

The sunset outside my window
Has lost all it's glow
The rose in the garden
Doesn't bloom any more
