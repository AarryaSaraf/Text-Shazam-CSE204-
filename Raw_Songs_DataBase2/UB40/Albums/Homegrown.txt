Album: Homegrown

// So Destructive //

It's so destructive
Counter productive
How we gonna make it
When we do not know where love lives [2x]

I'm not seeing what you're saying
All the games that you are playing
Look like tactics for delaying
While we're on our knees and praying
Making and breaking
Sitting and debating
The art of speculating
Then accumulating

I'm not buying what you're selling
All your shouting and a yelling
And the lies that you are telling
Don't strike me as compelling
Picking and choosing
Winning and losing
Cutting and bruising
Using and abusing

I'm not taking what you're giving
The elections you are rigging
From your penthouse living
The deals that you are fixing
Creeping and crawling
Running and falling
Stopping and stalling
Crying and bawling

// I Knew You //

I knew you before you knew
Who you wanted to be
Now I see the new you
She's a perfect stranger to me

Loves unkind, for I find
If only saw, the best of you
But my mind, not so blind
Showed my heart the rest of you
Scheming lies and alibis
That butter wouldn't melt disguise
With happy ever after eyes
That made a fool of me

I knew you before you knew
Who you wanted to be
Now I see the new you
She's a perfect stranger to me
She's a perfect stranger to me

Love is cruel It makes a fool
Of one who thought we had it all
All bridges burned, the lesson learned
You never really loved at all
Now you're gone, I'm on my own
Don't come around, don't even phone
Please leave a happy man alone
And we can both be free

I knew you before you knew
Who you wanted to be
Now I see the new you
She's a perfect stranger to me
She's a perfect stranger to me

// Drop On By //

Drop on by when the sun goes down
We can talk or just hang around
Shoot the breeze, tell me what you found
On your search for some common ground

Think of me when the moon is high
Counting stars in the clear night sky
Think of me when the moon is blue
Sitting here just thinking of you

I've been here and I've been there
It's the same most everywhere
We're all trying to get away
Live to fight another day

In my dreams I will follow you
Any place that you want me to
Tomorrow waits on the other side
Patiently for the sun to rise
Don't go now can't you stay a while
Light my night with your loving smile
Once you were gone but now your home
I couldn't bear being all alone

I've been here and I've been there
It's the same most everywhere

I've been here and I've been there
It's the same most everywhere
We're all trying to get away
Live to fight another day [2x]

// Someone Like Me //

We dont need to make excuses
Together we are free
To throw away the rule book
And start with ABC
We can go to all the places
We always wanted to be
It takes a bad girl like you
To love someone like me

If you're looking for a daddy
You won't get that from me
There are things I want to do to you
That he should never see
You will never scare me baby
You can try anything with me
It takes a bad girl like you
To love someone like me

Don't need no little woman
A wallflower's not for me
The only way I want you girl
Is independently
Wont't lock you up in prison
And throw away the key
It takes a bad girl like you
To love someone like me

Not looking for redemption
It's much too late for me
The two of us together girl
Can set each other free
Children need a mother
Buts it's not the same for me
It takes a bad girl like you
To love someone like me

// Freestyler //

Say we a just freestyle it
Because we wicked and wild it
Because we know how fe run it
And we just can't done it
And you know say we like it
And we have to excite it
If you come a dance
I say you might get frightin'
Because you know say we live it
And you say we love it
There is very few things I coulda really put above it
I love the booming of the base in a the speaker boxes
The treble in the tweeters it just
A tear off me hat see

I said you just can't trap it
I said you just can't unwrap it
Say you justs can't take it
Say you know you have to find it
Deep down in a your soul I say you have to feel it
Little after that you a go want to reveal it
Coz music is a thing I say you
Know you have to share it
If me couldn't do that
Me just couldn't bear it
Cos the love for the music on me
Sleeve me have fe wear it
Deep down in a me heart I said you
Just couldn't tear it

Me no like them journalist man
Dem come from different land
Say we is a white reggae band
Open your eyes no man you must
Be blind no man
You gwan like your cool man
Your heart must be black no man
Full of bad intention
We is dub organiser
A little oder and wiser
We no like wife beater spreading
Love would be sweeter
Out of many nations yes we are one
Just like the motto if you is Jamiacon

Deep in a the night the musics calling
Deep in a we hearts you know we're
falling in love
It's like a religious calling
Calling calling you better send out
A warning
Calling calling you better send out
A warning

// Everything Is Better Now //

Everything is better now
Better than is was before
Sunshine on a golden bough
Darkness locked behind closed door
Now I found a better place
Somewhere I can lay my head
Clean fresh air and open space
Safe upon my feather bed

I've been a mistake maker
For all of my days
And a law breaker
But crime never pays
An overtaker
On lifes highways
A serial faker
Making getaways

I've been a mover and a groover
In the halls of power
A real bad loser
In my darkest hour
A high seas cruiser
Searching tropical flowers
A pick and chooser
In an ivory tower

Now I'm a man of peace
With a hungry soul
For I found release
In a lost loophole
I'm the materpiece
Who just scored the goal
Let the love increase
Now I'm in control

// Just Be Good //

Just be good to each other...yeah
Donate some peace of mind
Invest in one another...yeah
A love of all mankind

Just be good to each other...yeah
You know we don't get long
It takes so much to recover...yeah
And we can't get it wrong

I'm the meanest, toughest, baddest boy in town
I'm a thief, a liar, one who hunts you down
The final word in justice, and i'll fill you full of hate
So down upon my knees, I am about
To seal you fate

If we're good to each other...yeah
If we just take the time
Treat all men as your brother...yeah
Everything will be fine

When we're good to each other...yeah
You can feel in your heart
The love that all lovers...yeah
When they're apart

I'm the biggest, richest, righteous and strong
Devil plays the tune, i'll make you sing my song
Finger on the button and my eyes are on the prize
In case you had forgotten, I'm a master of disguise

So be good to each other...yeah
And I trust you will find
On the road to discover...yeah
That true love is blind

A reformer coke addict, puppet on a string
My papa gives me credit, so I'm living like a king
Vengence will be mine, I will collect my dues
I'm a walking Armageddon so the world can
Sing the blues

Just be good to each other...yeah
Donate some peace of mind
Invest in one another...yeah
A love of all mankind

So be good to each other...yeah
And I trust you will find
On the road to discover...yeah
That true love is blind

Yeah

// Young Guns //

Hey hotshot, your're a one man band
The Don on the block with a glock in your hand
With the girl and the ride, you dont't wanna hear
Think you're getting respect, all you've found is fear
The one damn thing you're sure to find
Is another gun, where you gonna hide?
Said you'd never never run, I guess you lied
You're the fool in the crew that died
Your mother cried

Hold your fire, cool your temper
Young guns ever too bold
Hold your fire, just remember
Young guns never grow old

Hey hotshot, you're a one man band
The Don on the block with a glock in your hand
With the girl and the ride, you dont't wanna hear
Think you're getting respect all you find is fear
The one damn thing you're sure to find
Is a bigger gun to blow away your pride
Your young blood running in the roadside
And in the crossfire, innocents died
We all cried

Hold your fire, cool your temper
Young guns ever too bold
Hold your fire, just remember
Young guns never grow old.

Hey hotshot, you're a one man band
The don on the block with a glock in your hand
With the girl and the ride, you dont't wanna hear
Think your getting respect, all you've found is fear

Hold your fire, cool your temper
Young guns ever to bold
Hold your fire, just remember
Young guns never grow old
Hold your fire, cool your temper
Young guns ever too bold
Hold your fire, just remember
Young guns never grow old
Young guns never grow old
Young guns never grow old

// Hand That Rocks The Cradle //

Holidays are comin'
The kids are getting fat
Put another penny in the corporation hat
There's computer consolation now
For every boy and girl
Coz the hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world

Sony in the nursery, no need to turn the page
The cartoon generation are soon to come of age
Virtual relationships untouched by human hands
Laying their foundation in the ever shifting sand

If politics is just for fools, equality a dream
Then you'd better wear protection so you never hear them scream

Animated babysitters always there to play
Will keep the undesirables a million miles away
Everything is changing but the song remains the same
Asylum has been locked away, the seekers has been framed

// Nothing Without You //

When I'm with you I'm valuable
Original and fashionable
I'm totally formidable
When I'm with you

When you're with me invincible
I'm bullet-proof unsinkable
A one off individual
That's why you're with me

When I caught you unmissable
So loveable and kissable
Completely irresistable
That's why I caught you

Without you I am miserable
Unconfortable in principle
I think that we're inseperable
I'm nothing without you

Now you got me reliable
Flexible and pliable
You see its undeniable
That's where you got me

I'm nothing without you
A man without a goal
The last one waiting
A lost and lonely soul

// Nothing Without You (Dub) //

// Swing Low //

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry he home

I looked over Jordan and what did I see
Coming for to carry he home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Coming for to carry me home
Tell all my friends I'm coming too
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
