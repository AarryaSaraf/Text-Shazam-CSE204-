// Always There //

I'm running away
I've got to get home
I'm lost in a crowd
But I'm still on my own
I'm looking ahead
So I'm staying behind
I'm not being cruel
I'm just being kind

I close my eyes
It's no surprise
I'm always there
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I'm trying to lay low
But I keep getting high
My feet on the ground
Got my head in the sky
My eye on the future
That's stuck in the past
I find I can't lose
When I aim to come last

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

I'm right on the ball
But I'm missing the mark
I burn in the sun
I'm scared of the dark
Got an ivory tower
With a bird's eye view
Got plenty of time
But nothing to do

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I'm running away
I've got to get home
I'm lost in a crowd
But I'm still on my own
I'm looking ahead
So I'm staying behind
I'm not being cruel
I'm just being kind

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I close my eyes
It's no surprise
I'm always there
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

// Hurry Come On Up //

[Chorus:]
Hey, you, hurry come up
See how fast you come down
You run up your mouth
You run out of luck
You're running out of town

Hurry come up now you're all alone
You had to kick dirt on your stepping stone
You lost your way across the land
Foundations crumble built on shifting sand

[Chorus]

Hurry come up in the blink of an eye
You crowned yourself king of the castle high
You'll never get to heaven if you tell a lie
There's a hole in your bucket and your well's run dry

[Chorus]

Hurry come up we've got nothing to say
We sit back and watch you give yourself away
Where's all the power now they've pulled the plug
You're up to your neck in the hole you dug

[Chorus]

Hurry come up your edges are rough
We need a little love ain't life tough enough
There's no coming back your ticket's one way
Your journey don't start till judgement day

[Chorus]

Hurry come up just a fast as you can
Time's running out for your master plan
Cards on the table enough is enough
They hold the aces now they call your bluff

[Chorus]

Hurry come up when you turn off the light
How do you sleep in your bed at night
It's all a bad dream but no-one can hear
You only have yourself to fear

[Chorus]

// I Love It When You Smile //

[Chorus:]
I love it when you smile
When you're with me honey
It happens all the while
How it kills me when you cry
And you know my heart
That's no word of a lie

Everyday you show me something new about you
Honestly I could never live without you
Look at me here's a soul who'll never doubt you
And I will be forever by your side

[Chorus]

Probably the greatest feeling I have ever known
Actually is when you wrap yourself around me
Promise me you'll stay now that I've found you
And I will be forever by your side

[Chorus]

And you could say you've heard it all before
And I know that anyday you may walk out the door
When I say no one will love you more believe me
And I will be forever by your side

[Chorus]

// I've Been Missing You //

It's not because I've just been caught
It's not as if I planned this
I didn't give a single thought
One big misunderstanding
I see how things look from your side
I see how you're hurting
The reason that I didn't hide
One big misunderstanding

So I blew it again just like I always do
It's too late for sorry, this much is true
I did what I did
Just to make my way through
One more day far away from you
And I've been missing you

It's not the first won't be the last time
I've been caught red-handed
To tell the truth I cannot lie
One big misunderstanding
I haven't got an alibi
And I can't stop them talking
Cross my heart and hope to die
One big misunderstanding

So I blew it again just like I always do
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you
But I did what I did and I paid my dues
I've been missing you

It's not the first won't be the last time
I've been caught red-handed
To tell the truth I cannot lie
One big misunderstanding
I haven't got an alibi
And I can't stop them talking
I cross my heart and hope to die
One big misunderstanding

So I blew it again just like I always do
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you
But I did what I did and I paid my dues
I've been missing you

// Oracabessa Moonshine //

Oracabessa moonshine
Is washing over me
The Jacaranda tree
And bathing in the sea
Oracabessa sun up
Will chase the night away
Across the Lada bay
And back to yesterday

A warm Blue Mountain raincloud, welcomed by the land
Made the morning cooler, left a rainbow in the sand
Sweet Hibiscus lingers in my own backyard
With a million different colours of a Hummingbird

Orocabessa sunshine
Is washing over me
The Jacaranda tree
And bathing in the sea
Oracabessa sun up
Will chase the night away
Across the Lada bay
And back to yesterday

The Firefly's romance ignites the evening shade
Makes the twilight dance a moonlight serenade
The smoke sends out a signal above the golden sea
Another day in Ladda Bay is waiting there for me

Oracabessa moonshine
Is washing over me
The Jacaranda tree
And bathing in the sea
Oracabessa sun up
Will chase the night away
Across the Lada bay
And back to yesterday

// Guns In The Ghetto //

Daddy don't go out tonight
Just stay home till morning light
Me and mamma don't feel right
Please hold us tight

Daddy why did you go to work
When you know just how much we love you so
Please come back tomorrow

[Chorus:]
They're giving out guns in the ghetto
They're saying they will set you free
One day I'll have children of my own
But I'm afraid they won't have me

Mamma, is Daddy home
Why are you crying all alone
Grandma's tears have turned to stone
And I'm all alone

Mamma isn't daddy back
I'm getting scared and that's a fact
Why are we all dressed like that
All in black

[Chorus]

Daddy don't go out tonight
Please stay home till morning light
Me and mamma don't feel right
Please hold us tight

Daddy why did you go to work
When you know just how much we love you so
Please come back tomorrow

[Chorus]

Mamma, is Daddy home
Why are you crying all alone
Grandma's tears have turned to stone
And I'm chilled to the bone

Mamma isn't daddy back
I'm getting scared and that's a fact
Why are we all dressed like that
All in black

[Chorus 4x]

// Friendly Fire //

We were partners in crime
Spending our days, serving our time
In the usual way
We went behind the lines
To even the score
I won the battle but you won the war

I used to be a gun for hire
Then I was killed by friendly fire
I used to be a real high flyer
Then I was killed by friendly fire

A shot rang out
And knocked me flat
Ain't no coming back from a lick like that
I never saw it coming, it came out of the blue
I never did believe my assassin would be you

I got the message down the wire
That I was killed by friendly fire
I used to be a gun for hire
Then I was killed by friendly fire

We were partners in crime
Spending our days, serving our time
In the usual way
We went behind the lines
To even the score
I won the battle but you won the war

I used to be a gun for hire
Then I was killed by friendly fire
I used to be a real high flyer
Then I was shot by friendly fire

A shot rang out
And knocked me flat
Ain't no coming back from a lick like that
I never saw it coming, it came out of the blue
I never did believe my assasin would be you

I got the message down the wire
That I was killed by friendly fire
I used to be a gun for hire
Then I was killed by friendly fire

// I Really Can't Say //

[Chorus:]
I really can't say
How I feel right now
I would if I could
But I don't know how
Just give me some time
And I'll come around
I'll pick myself up
I'll dust myself down

Let's leave it at that
I don't want to fight
Don't say anything that you may regret
In fact, it's the last thing I need tonight
Your words in my head are hard to forget

[Chorus]

Let's leave it for now
Let's call it a day
We don't have to talk about this anymore
That look on you face gave it all away
We've travelled these roads many times before

[Chorus]

Let's leave it alone
Before it's too late
Give it a rest for a moment or two
We can pick it back up at a later date
If you feel that's what you have to do

[Chorus 4x]

// Lisa //

I admire you from afar
You've changed the way I see
I used to think that I
Should make you be like me
But after this short time
Watching what you do
I realise that I
Should strive to be like you

Whenever I am near you
I tread so awkwardly
Afraid someone may steal you
I guard you jealously

Then sing the world your praises
Let everybody know
That I just saw the future
A place I want to go

I admire you from afar
You've changed the way I see
I used to think that I
Should make you be like me
But after this short time
Watching what you do
I realise that I
Should strive to be like you

I hear you when you're talking
Untouched simplicity
Alive with expectations
In search of what might be

I admire you from afar
You've changed the way I see
I used to think that I
Should make you be like me
But after this short time
Watching what you do
I realise that I
Should strive to be like you

Then sing the world your praises
Let everybody know
That I just saw the future
A place I want to go

I hear you when you're talking
Untouched simplicity
Alive with expectations
In search of what might be

Then sing the world your praises
Let everybody know
That I just saw the future
A place I want to go

I hear you when you're talking
Untouched simplicity
Alive with expectations
In search of what might be

Then sing the world your praises
Let everybody know
That I just saw the future
A place I want to go
