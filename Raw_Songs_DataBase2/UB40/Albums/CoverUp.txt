// Rudie //

Hold it down Rudie enough is enough
Kill it with kindness, kill it with love
No more deceiving; so throw off the gloves
Kill them with kindness kill them with love.

Fill them with feeling straight from the heart
Dealing with healing will set you apart
Respecting their meaning; releasing the dove
Will chill them with kindness; instil them with love

Don't lose it Rudie get high on the buzz
Remember how kindness, could fill you with love
The sun could be shining with blue skies above.
In love with the kindness, so kind of in love.

Believing in nothing is hard to believe
Discovering something is hard to achieve
A change must be coming the times right because
We're in need of some kindness and needing some love

// Sparkle Of My Eyes //

Many a girl has caught my eye,
Many a girl and that ain't no lie.
But girl to me, you top them all,
So beautiful with no effort at all.

[Chorus:]
Sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes,
sparkle of my eyes, sparkle of my eyes.

Girl in you eyes I see the stars,
Warm as the sun, in spring you are,
A certain delight I feel in your touch,
And when you smile I love it so much.

[Chorus]

Gentle to me and so very kind,
Never saying no, you're good for my mind.
You ask me why your so special to me,
Look in these eyes girl, and then you will see.

[Chorus]

// Really //

I couldn't really put it any better than this
The love that I feel, in your tender kiss.
And something about your body girl I can't resist
It don't get no better, no better than this.

You know I love you - with all my heart and soul
You put me in a spell - and you have total control.
The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun

I really couldn't put it any better than this
The loving that I'm feeling in your tender kiss
Somethin' 'bout your body that I can't resist
Gotta tell you honey, don't get better than this
I  really couldn't tell you any better than this
The loving that you give me I won't contest
Wrap me up in loving that is simply the best
Gotta tell you baby you're the best in any test

The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun

So girl to me you know you are the sun and stars
Surely I would follow you, to Venus or Mars
Girl to me you know you make my whole world bright
'cause everything you do by me, you know is alright.
You know I love you - with all my heart and soul
You put me in a spell - and you got total control.

The feeling that I have
You know I can't explain
But it's something that I want
Again and again and again

Stay with me forever
For me you are the one
Stay with me forever
The fun has just begun
[Repeat 3x]

// The Day I Broke The Law //

Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I hope to find you all alone
With open arms to greet me at the door.
You cried as I was led away
It seems like only yesterday
But after all these years I can't be sure

[Chorus:]
While I've been dreaming dreams of you
Not knowing what your going through
I prayed that you'd remember me
But I know life goes on you see
I broke your heart the day I broke the law

The man you know don't hurt no more
My tears were shed behind locked door
I've told myself your gone ten thousand times.
Still when it got to much too bear
I'd run my fingers through your hair
Your kissing lips were always on my mind.

[Chorus]

So yesterday they set me free
They gave me back my liberty
They gave me something else I can't ignore,
The chance to go back where I'm from
The chance to even call upon
My friends but they don't live here anymore...

[Chorus]

// Let Me Know //

[Chorus:]
Let me know, what I got to do
Make it so, I can get it through to you
Blow by blow accounts in black and blue
Make it so, let it go, make it so...

Any other time we would welcome you
Right now there's something else we got to do
We commiserate but were running late
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]

Have we met before, can't remember you
Now tell us what it is you wanted us to do
Book a future date to negotiate
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]

The problem is fundamentally
Over the horizon where we can't see
We can't relate so we segregate
Hurry up and wait.

[Chorus]

// Cover Up //

[Chorus:]
Cover up
With loving protection
Guard your love
In every direction
Don't give up
For fear of rejection
Stand your ground and voice an objection

[Verse 1:]
Run away my sister and brother
Be afraid of love when the lover
Tries to read the book by the cover
Wrapped up in the arms of another

[Chorus]

Cover up prolonging the yearning
Just ahead the fires are burning
Swim for shore the tides are now turning
Love the ones you love with your learning

[Chorus]

Look ahead the futures depending
On the brave to now start defending
Tell the world the message you're sending
We don't need an unhappy ending

[Chorus]

Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

Got to be safe if you want to be free
To sit in the shade of the family tree

// Walk On Me Land //

[Chorus:]
Tell me somethin'
How come you walk on me land so?
How come you walk on me land so?
And tell me that it's yours

[Chorus]

For you to use as you see fit
So me and mine are forced to quit
And watch you devastating it
And tell me it belongs to you
You have the right, and I am wrong
You call the tune, I sing your song
And where I live, I don't belong
You tell me it belongs to you

[Chorus]

You have the right, and I am wrong
You call the tune, I sing your song
And where I live, I won't be long
You tell me it belongs to you
You get the riches, I have none
I do your work, you have the fun
I breathe your air, you block my sun
And tell me it belongs to you

[Chorus]

// Something More Than This //

I said, there must be something more than this
Green environmentalist
Back street agriculturist
Scientific herbalist
Herbalistic socialist
T.H.C dialysis
Grow your own psychiatrist
Smoking self-analysis

Said there must be something more than this
There must be something we a miss

Less is more so more or less
When there's nothing going on
Innocence is happiness
You ain't not doing nothing wrong

Said, there must be something more than this
Anti-vivisectionist
Freedom fighting activist
Headline making terrorist
Religious fundamentalist
Money lending capitalist
Bible bashing moralist
Revolution catalyst

Said there must be something more than this
There must be something we a miss

Less is more so more or less
When theres nothing going on
Innocence is happiness
You ain't not doing nothing wrong

// Everytime //

In a little while
I'll be on my way
Got no words to express
What I need to say

[Chorus:]
Every time I think about the first time
We said hello
You know when you know
You never let go

It's just not my style
Something I can't do
After all this time
I'm scared of losing you

[Chorus]

Is there anything
You could let me know
Surely you could find me
A reason not to go

[Chorus]

After everything
We've been going through
I'm so up and down
So dizzy and blue

[Chorus]

Let me one more time
Look into your eyes
I remember when
There were no goodbyes

[Chorus]

// I'm On The Up //

Thing's ain't so bad
They sure could be better
Thing's ain't so good
But I'm sure it won't last
Storm clouds above
But I got my umbrella
I would if I could
I can't change the past

[Chorus:]
I'm on the up
My futures tomorrow
Why should I worry
All I've got to find
Is another sad someone
Who'll happily give me
Just enough loving
For their peace of mind.

Things are a drag
But I'll get it together
Things make you strange
But that's how it goes,
I always say sorry
So no one remembers
I caused the pain
When I struck the first blows.

[Chorus]

Things ain't so good
But I'm not complaining
Things could be worse
I don't need to tell you
Hang out your washing
It's gonna start raining
Thunder clouds burst
So tell me whats new.

[Chorus]

// Look At Me //

Blame it all on me, you did nothing wrong
I was running free but it took so long
So long in fact that I
Can't remember why
I couldn't say goodbye

If you ask yourself, did I think of you
Oh so many times if you only knew
Knew how you made me feel
In dreams your kiss I'd steal
When nothing else was real

Far away from home everythings so clear
When you're all alone; no one else can hear
The loudest lonliness
Therefore I must confess
I'm full of emptiness

Full up on nothing I can call my own
I'll tell you something if only I had known
The end of every day
No matter what you say
Some how you always pay

Look at me, don't give up yet
What you see is what you get
Things just like they used to be
I've been missing you and me.

// Since I Met You Lady //

[Intro: Lady Saw Rap]

Since I met you lady
My whole life has changed
Since I met you lady
My whole life has changed
And everybody tells me
That I am not the same

I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody
To tell my troubles to
Since I met you baby
All I need is you

[Lady Saw Rap]

Since I met you lady
I'm a happy man
Since I met you lady
I'm a happy man
I'm going to try and please you
In everyway I can

[Lady Saw Rap]

// Walked In The Rain //

I've been away
High on a breeze
Tasted the salt of the seven blue seas
Washed upon shores
Sun in my eyes
Stayed long enough just to say my goodbyes...

I walked in the rain
Wet me through and through
Following rainbows that lead me back to you
I've always believed
In what I've been told
Where rainbows end there's a pot of gold...

I'll read the stars
Talk to the moon
Stop when I hear somebody playing our tune
Any excuse
And you'll see me
Drifting back home to the place I should be...

Some people say
Listen to me
Mostly I find that I disagree
They tell me to change
Set myself free
I'm not convinced I don't want to be me

Maybe I'll stay
Maybe I'll go
Maybe I'll stick around I don't know
One thing for sure
This I can say
I'm coming back; I've been so far away

// Write Off The Debt //

Write off the debt
Me say write off the debt
Me say write off the debt
And stop the third world a fret

I say the imf put on too much interest
Certain man pon the streets can't even buy a little vest
I said the east and the west them just a build up dem chest
Certain man in the third world can't even digest, a little food
But no bother take them man deh as no fool
Cos' you know say dem teach and go a good school
Me say lord a god a mercy dem learn up all the rules
So no bother patronise dem cos all dem need is the tools
Me say over the millennium me say what a bomb
Me say a whole heap of right
Me say a whole heap of wrong
I say it's time to come together and sing we own song
And make the shooting and all the killing and the fighting
Have fe done
I say the imf wipe off the lump sum
You know say me bredren that would a handsome
So come on fe me posse lets rehearse up this song
And hope say dem man yah don't take too long

Me say write off the debt
Me say write off the debt
And stop the third world a fret

Picture a world with no more hurt and pain
Picuture a world where we are all the same
Maybe not in mind but in spirit
Must do the right thing to ease the pain

Yes me breden that would a wicked!
