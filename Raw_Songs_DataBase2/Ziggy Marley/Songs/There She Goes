Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie
Tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be wrong
I wear no disguise
But I trod on through those memories
That haunt me, that haunt me
I trod on through those memories
That haunt me oh man that haunt me

There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I count they'd be a million or two

But I walk on through that memory
That haunts me oh man that haunts me
I say I trod on through that angry grief
That taunt me, that taunts me

There she goes crying again
But her sexiness won't cover her shame
And there she goes she's taking her true love
But while she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How, how, how could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I could count they'd be a million or two

Now I walk on through that rocky reef
That wants me and that wanted me
Woman I walk on through that angry grief
That taunts me, I say that taunts me

Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie, lie
I tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be
Wrong I wear no disguise, no I
There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking her true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun
Days I've wasted with you child
If I count, they'd be a million or two

Now I walk on through those memories
That wants me oh man that wants me
I said I trod on through that angry grief
That taunts me I know it taunts me

There she goes crying again
But her sweet caress won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame

How could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Why should I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun

There she goes crying again
There she goes crying again
