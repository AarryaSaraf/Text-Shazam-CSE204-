Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talk 'bout, dem talkin'
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout the new generation
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution

No more killings for religions
And their political divisions
No, don't you hate me for the colour of my skin
We are bragging and boasting
We are drinking and toasting
Instead of warmongers and thieves, yeah

Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful revolution
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout a new generation
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution

Yeah, yeah, yeah. yeah (and we will stop at nothing)
My revolution, your revolution
Let's just lift these man-made borders, it causes confusion
All of the prophets already came and they laid out the blueprint
Mind elevation, there's a message in the music
From East Africa to Jamrock, we rebels with a cause
And why dem politicians always declaring war? See

When we will stop dem now
And bring that sweet change
So woman is rejoicing in the coming, of a new name
As our feet often are bound
And we have broken their chains
Our minds are free again, to roam
The open plains

Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talkin' 'bout
Dem talkin' 'bout, dem talk 'bout, dem talkin'
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
Dem 'talkin' 'bout droppin' bombs
We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution
(We talkin' 'bout a peaceful solution)
Dem talkin' 'bout their old ways
We talkin' 'bout the new generation
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)
Dem talkin' 'bout world war
We talkin' 'bout world revolution
(Word revolution...)
