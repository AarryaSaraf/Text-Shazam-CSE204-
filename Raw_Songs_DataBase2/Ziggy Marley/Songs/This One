History been renamed
Time have no friend
Who you a go warn, when the real war come on
A no we you have to warn when the truth bust out

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one...

Malcolm X, Garvey, Martin, Marley, Mohammed, Yesus Christ
Strive and free your life
Don't play their games
Don't put your mind to waste, don't put your mind to waste

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one

Propaganda machine working overtime
Now more than ever on the younger minds
Don't just believe everything you see on the TV
Don't just believe everything you read in the magazine

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one

People have their place
Race has its pace
Each blow a the right one
Every blow carries a weight

No giving up in I, I will keep the faith
No giving up in I, fight them racist hate
No no no no no no no no you can't do nothing 'bout it
You can't do nothing 'bout it

Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
I am the one that is this one
We are the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one

This is the one that is this one
It a the right one, it a the real one...
