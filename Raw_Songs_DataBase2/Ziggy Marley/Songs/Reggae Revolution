Do the reggae...

It is a
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
It's got to be
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution

Down for the youth to take their time
I just can't take no slackers no more
We built in our place and through in the rest, yes
We just can't take no slackers no more
(All the homebugs that been) they're keepin' us down
Get on a bus and leave the town, right now
(All the homebugs that been) keepin' us down
Just get on a bus and leave the town

Cause it is
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
It's got to be
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
I know it is
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
It's got to be
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution

Babylon try to keep us down
I say, not in a million years, light years
And, what is all this fuss about, brother sister
Just open, open your ears

It is
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
It's got to be
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
I know it is
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution
It's got to be
Reggae, reggae, reggae revolution

Do the reggae...

Reggae, hit the storm...

Out of Babylon
Reach Mount Zion
