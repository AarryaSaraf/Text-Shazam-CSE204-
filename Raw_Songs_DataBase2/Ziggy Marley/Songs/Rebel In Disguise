If you don't see me smiling
It got nothing to do with you
My papa been on the rock so long
Inherited a permanent screw...

If you don't see me smiling
It ain't no concern of you
My mama been on the rock for so long
Inherited a permanent screw...

So you won't even know me
'Cause you can't look me in the eye
Well only then my friend you would see
That I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And I am a rebel in disguise
We are rebels in disguise
We are rebels in disguise

If you don't catch me smiling
Said I have got serious on my mind
Want to tell you a little story
We are living in a serious time...

Said a fire deh, said a fire deh
Fire deh a mus mus tall
You think a cool breeze
Life is real hard
But you think it gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me
The baby crying

You come and ask us for a dollar bill
And we give you ten
Simply mean you should not be coming back again
Simply mean you go home and learn to help yourself

You are putting, you are putting on the pressure
Making it, making it much harder

If you don't see me smiling
It ain't got nothing to do with you
...
Then again you might have done something wrong
And you don't know where you belong
...
So you won't really know us

We are rebels in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
Fire de a mus mus tail
And you think a cool breeze
Your life is real hard but you think it's gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me
