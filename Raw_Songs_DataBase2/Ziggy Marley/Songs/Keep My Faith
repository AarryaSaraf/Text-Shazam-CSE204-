Worlds all changing
They trying to change us too
I might be going crazy
What am I to do

Keep my faith

Walls crumble around me
I'm not surprised
What could I do
When you took my rights

Keep my faith

Like forty days and forty nights
In this wilderness of life
I am tempted
Frustration stirs up strife
Oh no no

Keep my faith

Circle around the sun
The signs are in the skies
The day will come
After the night

Mama say
Keep my faith, what you gonna do
Daddy say Lord
Keep my faith
Jah Jah say now
Keep my faith
People say
Keep my faith
Nothing they can do
Keep my faith
I even could be blue
I keep my faith
Could be down in the trenches
Could be down in the trenches
Keep my faith
Could down on my last breath
Keep my faith

One more thing Jim
Walls crumble around me
I am not surprised
There's nothing I could do
When they took my rights but
What you say

Keep my faith
Jah Jah, keep my faith
What you gonna do
Jah I keep my faith
I'll keep my faith
What you gonna do
Keep my faith
