X marks the spot
Turn it back now
Fighting to see
Equality
X marks the spot
Turn it back now
Fighting to see
Equality

Jah no great
Is this man
Said you  for righteousness
Fighting to see
This dignity

We're living in a warzone
But we're not on the run
We're living in a bombshell world
And make it so 
It never done

X marks the spot

Fighting to see
Equality
Why that look on your face
It's plain
Fighting to see
Equal opportunity

 irie
Just to keep them fatalized
Trouble in a brain now
All man shall feel the pain, yeah

Sister 
Our people are slaves
Our people our sweat
In a sea of blood
In a sea of blood
In a sea of blood

White racist mentality
I'm not 
Black man becomes a enemy
He must cry

Don't ye be no hypocrite or play no cheats my mind
I said, we'll travel the world and see our own I?
Our own I?

We're living in a warzone
But we're not on the run
We're living in a bombshell world
The fight has just began

X mark them spot
Fighting, fighting, fighting night and day
X mark them spot
Mark them spot...

It's the system that make our people a slave
Our people our sweat in a sea of blood
Sea of blood
Sea of blood
Sea of blood
