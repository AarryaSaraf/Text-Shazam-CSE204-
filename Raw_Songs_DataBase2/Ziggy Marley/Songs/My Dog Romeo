I have two legs, my friend he has four
He likes to stop and I like to go
I like to smell the flowers, he likes to smell the floors
He is really fat for just 12 weeks old
He wakes me in the morning, six o'clock sharp
I take him out to potty and he rolls in the grass
He loves to meet people when they come to the door
And when I play my guitar he chills on the floor

My dog Romeo, my dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now to my dog Romeo
My dog Romeo, that's my dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now that's my dog Romeo

He always give affection, he always get love
Sometimes he pretends that he is a wild animal
He running through the bushes with a bone in his mouth
When he done running the bushes then he's knocking at the door
We'll take him for a walk to get his mind real clear
And sometimes he's the one who wants to take you somewhere
Hey Romeo, where you going? No this way
Yeah come on boy, good boy, good boy, good boy

My dog Romeo, dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now to my dog Romeo
My dog Romeo, dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now to my dog Romeo
My dog Romeo, that's my dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now to all the dogs all around
My dog Romeo, that's my dog Romeo
Send a shout out and big up now to all the dogs all around
