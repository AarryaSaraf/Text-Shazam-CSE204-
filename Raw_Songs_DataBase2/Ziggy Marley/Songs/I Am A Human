I am a human
Haven't I suffered for so long?
Still the reasons for hope
Keep on holding on
I am a human
Well, I am a child like her
And if you look into my eyes
Deep down there's a light

I'm not a Christian, I'm not a Muslim
I'm not a Jew, it shouldn't matter to you
I'm not a capitalist and I'm not a communist
I'm not a socialist, I'm not the politics
Tell me, are these the reasons, you can't live right?

I am a human
Haven't I suffered for too long?
Still the reasons for hope
Keep on holding on
I am a human
Yes, I'm a child like her
And if you look into my eye
Deep down there's a light

I'm not a soldier, I'm not a jihadist
I'm not a Buddhist, I'm not a Hindu
I'm not a "what", I am a "who"
I'm not black and I'm not white
Tell me, if this is why we fight?

I am a human
Haven't I suffered for so long?
Still the reasons for hope
Keep on holding on
I am a human
Well, I am a child like her
And if you look into my eyes
Deep down there's a light

I'm not a Christian, I'm not a Muslim
I'm not a Jew, it shouldn't matter to you
I'm not a capitalist and I'm not a communist
I'm not a socialist, I'm not the politics
Tell me, are these the reasons, you can't live right?

I, I, I, I

I am a human
Haven't I suffered for too long?
Still the reasons for hope
Keep on holding on
I am a human
Yes, I'm a child like her
And if you look into my eye
Deep down there's a light

I am a human
Haven't I suffered for so long?
Still the reasons for hope
Keep on holding on
I am a human
Well, I am a child like her
And if you look into my eyes
Deep down there's a light
