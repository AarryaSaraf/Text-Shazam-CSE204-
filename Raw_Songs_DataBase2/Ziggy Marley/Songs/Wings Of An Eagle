If I have the wings of an eagle 
I would fly, fly away 
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeee at rest 

If I have the wings of an eagle 
If I have the wings of an eagle

Since I have no wings 
Since I have no wings 

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, eh 

Since I have no wings

Since I have no wings 

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, sing 

If I have the wings of an eagle 
If I have the wings of an eagle, oh oh oh 
I would fly, fly away 
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeeee at rest 

If I have the wings of an eagle 
If I have the wings of an eagle 
I would fly, fly away 
Flyyyyyyy awayyyyyyy and beeeeeee at rest 

Oh, 
Since I have no wings 
Since I have no wings 
Since I have no wings 

I'm gonna sing, sing, sing, eh 

Since I have no wings
