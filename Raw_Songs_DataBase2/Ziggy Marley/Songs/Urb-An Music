Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music

Lord they fight it so
And I bet they don't even know
What it can do for all of you

Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music

And they will never get rid of it
And who can refuse it
For peace and harmony
For love and unity

Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music

Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music

And they say it's no good for you
And they say it can control you
So the higher ones know

Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music

Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
Urb-an music, urb-an music, urb-an music
