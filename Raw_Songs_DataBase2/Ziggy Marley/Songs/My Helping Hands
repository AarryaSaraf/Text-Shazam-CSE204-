These are my hands, my hands are used for many things
I brush my teeth with my hands
I hug with my hands, I even paint with my hands

But what I really love to do most of all with my hands is help
I help my dad to make breakfast with my hands
I help my mom to unpack her bags when she comes
From the store, with my hands

I help to change my baby brother with my hands
I help to put away my toys with my hands
I love to do many things with my hands
But most of all I love to help with my hands, my helping hands
