We are the people
We're not corporations
We are the people
We're not labels for your stock
We are the people
We're not crayons in a box
We are the people
We're not donkeys and elephants

Taking over from machines
Who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play
Are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open you heart
Now don't be deceived
Oh, when you see yourself for who you are
You'll be truly free

We are the people
Listen to our song
We are the people
Together we are strong
We are the people
Stronger than one race
We are the people
Stronger the one fate

To divide us, to define us
Categorise us, to neutralise us
Like robots living in a dream
Doing what they think they must
Scenes in black and white
Painted with the brush

So you think they care
It's a paper town
With paper politicians, oh yes
Hey, you think you're safe
In your hiding place
Way up on the cloud

Spread it all around the world
Our voices must be heard
With dignity and might
Oh, what a beautiful sight

We are the people
We're not corporations
We are the people
We're not labels for the stock
We are the people
We're not crayons in a box
We are the people
We're not donkeys and elephants

Now taking over from machines
Who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play
Are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open you heart
And don't be deceived
Now when you see yourself for who you are
You'll be truly free

We are the people, oh
Listen to our song
We are the people
Together we are strong
We are the people
Stronger than one race
We are the people, yeah
Stronger the one fate

We are the people
We're not corporations
We are the people
We're not labels for your stock
We are the people
Now we're not crayons in a box
We are the people
We're not donkeys and elephants
