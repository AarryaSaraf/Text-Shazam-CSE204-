It's give a little more to the Earth today
Let's forget them politicians today
Put down your weapons of war today
Let's just love everyone love
Today

Tomorrow will never come
Tomorrow is never here
So don't you put off what we can do right now
'Cause tomorrow will never appear
Today

Who will forget the value of money today
Remember what life is worth
Is this the human race
Put all material wants behind today
Let's just seek to be spiritually divine
Today

So don't you take the negative they're sending
Never you pat from this positive something
Share the joy my love is giving
So sweet divine in tune with mine life worth living
Today

Why don't you give a little more to the Earth today
Let us forget them politician today
Put down your weapons of war today
Let's just love everyone love
Today
