These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, may I have some candy?
Please, can I watch some TV?

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, can you roll down my window?
Please, can I have some tomorrow?

To say sorry is fine
Hey, we can laugh and cry at the same time
And when it's time for me to do
Remember magic words make dreams come true

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, I would like some pizza?
Please, may I have some ice cream?

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please can I get a banjo? (Why?)
Please

These are the words we use every day
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, can I have that toy?
Please, let's live in joy

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, can I have a Madeline?
Please, it's not my bedtime

To say thank you is nice
When you ask and get the things I like
And when it's time for you to do
Remember magic words
Make your dreams come true

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Thank you
