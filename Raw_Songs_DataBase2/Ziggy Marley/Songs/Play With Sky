I'm goin' outside, gonna play with sky
I run outside and I play with sky
Running wild, play with sky
Waving high, it mystifies
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

Now a wondering breeze came blowing by
She said, "If you see the sun, don't look Him in the eye"
Goin' outside to play with sky, yeah
Just like the free birds love to fly
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

Let's clarify (clarify)
We play with sky (play with sky)
Eat blueberry pie (berry pie)
Play with the sky (play with sky)
Goin' outside (play with sky, play with sky)
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
Feel the vibe (play with sky)
If you are a rainbow, then you know why
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

And now comes the sun
Wanna have some fun?
He said let's run
Run, run
To the edge of the sea
Where we say goodnight and good eve (good eve)
And when we're tired of stayin' inside
We goin' outside and we're playin' with the sky

(Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky)
