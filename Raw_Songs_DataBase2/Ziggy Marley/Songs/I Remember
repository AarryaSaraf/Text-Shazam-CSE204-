Haunting memories won't leave me alone
Haunting memories won't leave me alone

I remember you what you did to me, I remember
October November, I remember what you did to me
Hot night in summer I never forget the time in June, I remember
The love we had why make it look so bad, I remember

I remember the place, I remember your face, I remember it, oh so well, I remember
I remember your touch, I remember how much, I remember how we felt

All the good times were not for waste
And we were never in any haste
We grew to know each other well so well
Our lives a story to tell

I remember you what I did to you, do you remember?
October November, I remember what I did to you
Hot night in summer I never forget the time in June, do you remember?
The love we had why make it look so bad, I remember

I remember the place, I remember your face, I remember it, oh so well, I remember
I remember your touch, I remember how much, I remember how we felt, I remember
I remember you, I remember we,  used to be, I remember
I remember how, I remember when, I remember now and then, I remember
