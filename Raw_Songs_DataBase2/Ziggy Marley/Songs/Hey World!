Hey world, look around today, people
Do you see, do you see, do you see what you like
Do like what you see, hahaha, you better wake up
Come on!

Hey world, aren't you afraid
The fool called man is gonna blow you away
The situation is drastic
And the green grass is turning to plastic

Well, I'mma sayin'
Hey world, you better wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up

Pretty green forest are almost gone
Once happy animal sing a sad song
Air polluted it smug
Ocean's fill with oil and rain

Come on, hey
Hey world, you better wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up

Missile flying higher than high
Once fall mountains and so high
The bubbling roots have lost their bubbles
Check it out, huh, we're in trouble
Well, well it seems you don't even care
You came around you must be square

So we singing
Hey world, you better wake up
Wake up, wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Hey world, you better, you better wake up

Hey world, aren't you afraid
The fool called man is gonna blow us away
The situation is drastic
And your green grass turning to plastic
Huh, come on

Believe me
Hey world, you better wake up
Believe me
Hey world, you got to wake up
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
You're gonna wake up
You're gonna shake up
Uh, you got to wake up
Ah, you got to shake up...
