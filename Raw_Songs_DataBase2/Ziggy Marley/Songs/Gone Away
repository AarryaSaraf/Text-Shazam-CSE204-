Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
Share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I will no longer live this life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
All things have come to an end
Now be mindful of prayer

I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
I'm gone away
To that place, to that place 

When we're gone
What we leave behind is of no consequence
Just the love that we take
Will be our only memories
Like a child at play
The tears will soon dry away
Like a bright sunny day
No need to have any more fears

You're gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
You're gone away
To that place, to that place

Gone away

Lululu...

Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
To share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I no longer live the life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
Everything had come to an end
Now I've been mindful of prayer

I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night of day 
I'm gone away
To that place
Gone away
