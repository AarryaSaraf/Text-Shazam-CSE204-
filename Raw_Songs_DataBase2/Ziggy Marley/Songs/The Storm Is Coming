Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there?
The storm is coming, be ready

Brother, it's a big one
Still you just can't run
Momma can't move
So you got to stay
Rebel inna disguise
Must find a way
Harambe
A me say, harambe

Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready

Sister, it's a warning
And the eye is a-coming
Helping out your neighbour
Good God, do me a favour
Destroying all the trees
With your money disease
Causing worldwide grief
Oh, the earth need a relief

This might be if it's based on reality
You can't turn to the past, can't change your own history (cho)
The future is in my today, not my tomorrow
That's why when I grab up my pen to paper and write away the stars
You see, people can't live on promises and wishful thinking
You see, to the collective consciousness is whom I'm speaking
You see, this is a message to the world I live in
You see, you see, you see, you see

Rebel inna disguise
Oh, must find a way
Harambe
A me say Harambe

Yo, how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there (how it look out there)?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready

How it look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, get ready
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, be ready

How it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
Roll up my window (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, get ready)
Secure my door (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, are you ready?)
Suriprise in store (how it look down there?)
(The storm is coming, be ready)
