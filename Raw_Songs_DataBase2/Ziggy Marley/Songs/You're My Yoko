You're my Yoko,
You're my Yoko Ono
You're my beauty queen
You're my fashion scene

Baby be my muse
I'm the one to choose
Take me on that ride
Wave the milky way goodbye
You give me good vibration
Oh you're sweet inspiration

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

You're my love machine
End the wars and find the peace
Making love wrapped in the sheets
While those preachers they preach
The art of life we lead
So the freedom that we feel
Together we will stay
When will the world see things our way

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

The Boys will be sad
Remembering the good times that we had
The girls will be mad
(Ziggy we don't have what we used to have)
When it's time to groove
Can't be waiting on tomorrow, Oh no
So let the music play
(Hey we'll find ourselves in the melody)

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
