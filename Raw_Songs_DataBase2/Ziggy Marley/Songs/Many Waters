Set me as a seal on your heart
Love is stronger than death
Jealousy is cruel as the grave
Love, many waters cannot quench

Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see
I got some love inside of me
Love, many waters cannot quench

Dreams of you fill my reality
Beautiful you are my love
Your eyes are doves behind the veil
Fair as the moon
Strong as the sun

Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see
So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see

Set me as a seal on your heart
Love is stronger than death
Jealousy is cruel as the grave
Love, many waters cannot quench

Won't retreat, won't surrender
I want you to remember

Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of me
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench
