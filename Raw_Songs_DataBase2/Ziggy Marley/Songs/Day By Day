Now whether you come from yard or whether you come from London
Wanna hear this one on your radio station
Conscious lyrics have to reach number one
Teach we come to teach we come to teach the nation lyrically lyrically inspiration
Love and nuff unity with lots of education
We'll take it by the hundred take it one by one
This is ragga with the inspiration
I can only sing of destruction today cause my people are shedding blood everywhere
There is no happy song to sing when every time I'm frowning
I watch my back as I pass through 'cause they're aiming their bullets at me
Jah say he see us through so I knew that the wicked would perish
Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yeah
No matter how hard it seems never forget your dreams

Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day

We laugh at them for they know their day is coming
The wicked draw their sword to slay the upright
The wicked bend their bows to cast down the poor
Yet their swords shall pierce them in their own hearts
Never you lose your faith things and times will have to change yeah
Say you might be down today but never you lose your faith

Just take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day

Boom boom boom raggamuffin done tell you this yah tune yah a boom

Boom this yah boom this yah tune yah a boom raga muffin on the version so it must be a boom
Boom this boom this yah tune yah a boom boom boom
This is ragga ragga telling you 'bout the boom
Worry not of tomorrow for we know not what a day may bring
Faithful are the wounds of a brother than the kisses from an enemy
Pride is their chain of honor violence is the garment that covers them
My feet were at that stumbling point but I didn't slip
Never forget your dreams life is full of ups and downs yeah
Say no matter how hard it seems never forget your dreams

Let's take it day by day by day by day by day by day day by day by day by day by day
