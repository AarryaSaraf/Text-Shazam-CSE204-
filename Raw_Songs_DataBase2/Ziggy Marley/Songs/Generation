Many generation have passed away
Fighting for the same cause, we fight for today
Now some people say when will it happen
And that's what they say, now let us tell them something

My generation will make the change, wi hafe bring it come
This generation will make the change

How could I dream that this will go on
For more many years, until a kid become a man
Fighting for freedom, oh it's a deadly thing
And trying to get away from reality is dangerous

My generation will make the change, sing along
This generation will make the change

Some man lose faith, too long ina the struggle
Oh no we can't lose faith, we born ina the struggle
Like they say we were born in sin, well
Young blood ina the struggle

Now is the time, no more talk and play
Now wake up lazy mind sleep for you today
Now youth responsible, when all else have failed
And there will be no more blaming someone else

My generation will make the change, I'm so glad to see
This generation will make the change, hard as it may be
My generation will make the change, this ain't no talk no cheap
This generation will make the change, this ain't no weep no weep

My generation will make the change
This generation will make the change
My generation will make the change
This generation will make the change

My generation will make the change
This generation will make the change
