This something for my baby oh, explaining how the way it goes
Want to tell you you're my cherry oh this is how the way it goes
She says it's my line of work that makes a woman really hurt
I said yo I'm trying but she started crying
She believes I'm lying I'm trying she says

Five days a year I don't see you much five days a year, it's not enough
Five days a year that's really rough five days a year, yeah
Now I could tell she really hurts and she thinks I'm dishing dirt
But Jah Jah knows I'm trying but she insists I'm lying

Well, she keeps on crying and crying she says
Five days a year I don't see you much five days a year, it's not enough
Five days a year that's really rough five days this year, yeah
She say we don't do things together anymore and it seems we're not together anymore
...
