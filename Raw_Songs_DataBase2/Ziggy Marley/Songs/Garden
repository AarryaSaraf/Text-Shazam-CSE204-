In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We conquer them all

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of wickedness
You reap what you sow
There the youth should dare not go
Remember what you've been told

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of fruitfulness
You plan and it will grow
There death is of no threat
Life ever flows

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of happiness
Where life is at its best
Despair is far from near
I am free from all material care

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We've conquered them all

Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...

Never spare your rod from me...

Jah never spare that rod from me
I need it desperately
