I am my momma's son, you are your father's child
Sometime we act as if we hate each other
A different fate, a different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

Some are black and brown, others white and light
That's all the difference I can remember
Different face, different kind of smile
That's what we see but this we must realize

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

Earth is my mother, there is no other
So for you, so for all of I
Don't look me with a scorn
In time mankind was born

So for you, so for all of I
Love must live, hate must die
Don't join a rind
Don't you be so blind

We are all brothers and sisters
We are all brothers and sisters

I am no stranger in your town
Rasta seed is all around, yeah
Now when you're lookin' at me
Don't think I am your enemy

I am my father's son, you are your momma child
Sometime we act as if we hate each other
A different fate, a different state of mind
That don't mean we all can't be satisfied

Ah, brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all

Brothers and sisters, whom without life
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters
Brothers and sisters, we are all

Brothers and sisters, all an' all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, we are all
Brothers and sisters, all an' all
