// Keep My Faith //

Worlds all changing
They trying to change us too
I might be going crazy
What am I to do

Keep my faith

Walls crumble around me
I'm not surprised
What could I do
When you took my rights

Keep my faith

Like forty days and forty nights
In this wilderness of life
I am tempted
Frustration stirs up strife
Oh no no

Keep my faith

Circle around the sun
The signs are in the skies
The day will come
After the night

Mama say
Keep my faith, what you gonna do
Daddy say Lord
Keep my faith
Jah Jah say now
Keep my faith
People say
Keep my faith
Nothing they can do
Keep my faith
I even could be blue
I keep my faith
Could be down in the trenches
Could be down in the trenches
Keep my faith
Could down on my last breath
Keep my faith

One more thing Jim
Walls crumble around me
I am not surprised
There's nothing I could do
When they took my rights but
What you say

Keep my faith
Jah Jah, keep my faith
What you gonna do
Jah I keep my faith
I'll keep my faith
What you gonna do
Keep my faith

// We Are One //

There is a knowledge we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know
There is a knowledge we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know

We are one

There is a spirit we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know
There is a spirit we all know
Yet we don't know, yet we don't know

We are one

Is it so hard to love one another
My brother
To see each other as we are
My sister
The earthy family
Forever

Wake up
Wake up now
Wake up
Wake up now 
Wake up to the realization
That we are all of one nation
Everyone let's have some fun
Under the moon, the stars, the sun

Cause we are one
We are one

There is a knowledge
We are one
There is a spirit
We are one

// Beautiful Day //

Take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day

You could be sad
But I rather you not be
Don't dwell on the negative
Just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day

We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When your eyes are open
You'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
Yeah, It's just a beautiful day

Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Keep your head up high
Take a look into the sky

I take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day

I could be sad
But you rather me not be
Don't dwell on the negative just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
And it's a beautiful day

We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When our eyes are open
We'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
A beautiful day

Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Look in the sky
Keep your head up high

It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
No one can take that away
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
Don't you feel no way
It's just a beautiful day

// Gone Away //

Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
Share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I will no longer live this life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
All things have come to an end
Now be mindful of prayer

I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
I'm gone away
To that place, to that place 

When we're gone
What we leave behind is of no consequence
Just the love that we take
Will be our only memories
Like a child at play
The tears will soon dry away
Like a bright sunny day
No need to have any more fears

You're gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
You're gone away
To that place, to that place

Gone away

Lululu...

Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
To share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I no longer live the life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
Everything had come to an end
Now I've been mindful of prayer

I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night of day 
I'm gone away
To that place
Gone away

// Higher Vibration //

These city walls
Are like a prison
Why we gotta keep on living
With our backs against the wall

We are creatures of love
Victims of hate
We gotta keep on living
With our backs against the wall

No no no
Start living on a higher vibration
Now we take it to the heights of creation

Perfection of divinity
Is everyone's duty
Don't waste your time
Living for the vanities
We are creatures of faith
Victims of destiny
Which we create

Now we living on a higher vibration
'Cause we take it to the heights of creation

You know what I'm talking 'bout
Don't tell me no
Baby I could scream and shout
But I won't
It's a human experience
On another sphere
Well, it's a human existence
On another wavelength

Listen to me now
Now we living on a higher vibration
Then we take it to the heights of creation

Let me take you little higher
And then you take me little higher

// All I Need Is You //

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you

Sorrow sometimes teach a lesson well
And I know that good can come from bad
So let's look into that morning star
'Cause we know just who we are

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you

Man, this road I said it's rocky rough
So much obstacles and barriers
Ecclesiastes man him say
Everything is vanity

I don't need no body
All I need is you

Sorrow sometimes teach a lesson well
And I know that good can come from bad
So let's look into that morning star
'Cause you know just who you are

I don't need no body
To make me happy
All I need is you

I don't need no money
To live how I should
All I need is you

// One Good Spliff //

We gon' do our best
Never let it rest
Till our good be better
And our better best

Said I don't drink coffee
For they say 
It's just not right for me
But what makes me irie
Is if I could get a little piece of tree

And build
One good spliff
Me and my little brothers
We take a ride
Gonna teach them
All the lessons that I have learned in life

One good spliff
Me and my younger brothers
We take a ride
I've gotta teach them
All the lessons that I have learned in life

Sometimes I feel the pressure
But I know that I'll be fine
Just as long as you got me 
Something for my mind

Now let me get a rizzla
Little bit a herb
Light a old match
Let me settle my nerves
I gotta feel real high
Just to touch up on these tracks
Several ounces a day as a matter of fact

Now in Jamaica
Where the air is clean
And the buds all glisten with the glowing green 
Guaranteed to lift you up
If you know what I mean
Read me loud and clear
Let me hear you scream
Now, you haven't been there
You should go there soon
And pass through the country
Get a touch of the boom
Go back to your shack or your hotel room
Call Mom and Pop says 
I'll be home soon
Hanging with the Marleys all afternoon
And I ain't coming home till next May or June

Keep giving me the good vibration
It's giving me that inspiration
And I love that good sensation
Matter of fact
I think I might build myself one

One good spliff
Me and my younger sisters
We take a ride
One good spliff
Start the day out right
One good spliff
I didn't get no sleep last night
And I've got to get
One good spliff

I'm picking up 
Good vibrations
One good spliff

// Let It Go //

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

It's a vibration 
A sensation
A natural mystic 
All around
Coming to you from above
Coming to you from underground

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music

Let it go, you've got to let it go
Let it go, you've got to let it flow

Sometimes we just got to let go
Of everything we think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
I got nothing to lose
When I'm dancing to the music

Just call me music
And don't call me nothing else
All your might
Say we dancing through the night
With all your might
Say we grooving through the night

Sometimes you just got to let go
Of everything you think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be

Let it go
Let your body go 

Let it go
A sensation, a natural mystic
Let your body go
Let it go now
Free your soul now
Let it go

// 13 Months Of Sunshine //

13 months of sunshine
Is what we got

Take us to, take us to, take us to that land

Who shall ascend the hill
Stand in that holy place
Lift up your heads
O ancient gates

13 months of sunshine
Is what she got

Forward to, forward to, forward to that land

Where the water run
We want to be
Earth gives food
Feeds you and me
Amharic chant

Forward to that land

Now the sun is in my eyes
Well I say
I'm feeling high

Take us to that land
Forward to that land

13 months of sunshine

// Many Waters //

Set me as a seal on your heart
Love is stronger than death
Jealousy is cruel as the grave
Love, many waters cannot quench

Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench

Fair as the moon
Strong as the sun

Many waters cannot quench

So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench

Won't retreat, won't surrender

I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of me
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench
