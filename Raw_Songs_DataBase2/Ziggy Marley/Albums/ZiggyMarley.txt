// Start It Up //

Start it up,
Bring a revolution
Front the evolution
Love's the contribution. Sing.
Start it up,
Heal the wounded warriors
Raise us to victorious
Start it up,
Be the one who leads us
Right from wrong will be just
All we need is your trust
Start it up,yeah

Like a lion in the morning sun
You can live like a champion
Save the world we live in
Burn down the walls of our skin
We can rise from the ashes again

Start it up
Bring a revolution
Front the evolution
Love's the contribution. Sing.
Start it up,
Heal the wounded warriors
Raise us to victorious
Start it up,
Be the one who leads us
Right from wrong will be just
All we need is your trust
Start it up,

When the politician take all our rights
And they shake us all down with their might
When government can shoot
Down on defenseless youth
You can see people's marches unite

Start it up,
Bring a revolution
Front the evolution
Love's the contribution. Sing.
Start it up,
Heal the wounded warriors
Raise us to victorious
Start it up,
Be the one who leads us
Right from wrong will be just
All we need is your trust
Start it up, start it up,

It don't take a blind man to see where the world is headed
It won't take a wise man to know that our Earth is threatened
There is no future to seek if we don't come together
Love is the chance that we take and the answer forever
Yeah, sing it with me

Start it up, start it up, start it up
Love's the contribution. Listen.

Like a lion in the morning sun
You can live like a champion
Save the world we live in
Burn down the walls of our skin
We can rise from the ashes again

Start it up,
Bring a revolution
Front the evolution
Love's the contribution. Sing.
Start it up,
Heal the wounded warriors
Raise us to victorious
Start it up,
Be the one who leads us
Right from wrong will be just
All we need is your trust
Start it up, start it up,
Who's gonna start it up?
Who's gonna start it up?
Start it up

Verily I say amen, amen. Verily I say amen, amen.

Who will profit without shame, those who profit from human pain.

There is a thirst that must be quenched, for the hearts of the broken.

Verily I say amen, amen. verily I say amen, amen.

How much is that black soul? How deep is that black hole?
Don't let money be your master, freedom for the modern slave.
I'm giving out the thorn with the rose, oh let all the people bemoan.
It feels like the end of the days, oh my God the devil will pay.

Verily I say, I'm building bridges. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, let Noah build the ark. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, bring the people together. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, thats what I'm living for. Amen, amen.

By the still waters we lay; in the green grass we play.
It cost to keep this world afraid, a price that we just cant pay.
To keep the monsters from the gates, we gonna pull together.
For the suffering to be saved, hey, we gonna to pull together!

Verily I say, time is now. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, it has begun. Amen, amen.
Verily I say and here I come.
Verily I say, I'm the first born son. Amen, amen.

No more, no more, no more

They're killing for money

And the pain is like a chain
When rage is what remains
Then who are you to blame?
Let's stand up for the children
The motherless and fatherless
The world is just a mirror
Take a look upon yourselves

'Cause heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more
No, heaven can't take it no more
And heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more, no more

Now let's lift up all humanity
There's been too much tragedy
We can give each other love and respect
Now let's change our reality, 'cause

'Cause heaven can't take it no more
No more, no more
Heaven can't take it no more
Heaven can't take it no more

A child without a home

Refugees of war

A mother with her wolves
A child without a home
The refugees of war

It's deja-vu once again
It's the same old thing
Stop fussing and fighting, yeah
The truth is we're hurting
Can't you see it's not working
For me or you, for me or you

Oh, freed from its cage

Let's have a holiday
I treat ya good
And ya treat me right
Coming out of the darkness
Gettin' into the light
Now I leave my pride
And your loftiness
Said we take it off
Until there's nothing left
Well, I present my face
To your inner and outer space
You don't have to hide your face
It's not a human disgrace

Won't you try to be loving

And we can be together
Sometime and by the weather
Bathing on the Caribbean Sea
Yo peace and harmony
That's what you mean to me
And that's the way we should be
No, don't forget your past
But we're back at last
And now it's what we lead
So much to live for
No need to die and kill for
What I believe

Hey, won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Yeah, come on
Come on and try to be loving, come here

// We Are The People //

We are the people
We're not corporations
We are the people
We're not labels for your stock
We are the people
We're not crayons in a box
We are the people
We're not donkeys and elephants

Taking over from machines
Who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play
Are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open you heart
Now don't be deceived
Oh, when you see yourself for who you are
You'll be truly free

We are the people
Listen to our song
We are the people
Together we are strong
We are the people
Stronger than one race
We are the people
Stronger the one fate

To divide us, to define us
Categorise us, to neutralise us
Like robots living in a dream
Doing what they think they must
Scenes in black and white
Painted with the brush

So you think they care
It's a paper town
With paper politicians, oh yes
Hey, you think you're safe
In your hiding place
Way up on the cloud

Spread it all around the world
Our voices must be heard
With dignity and might
Oh, what a beautiful sight

We are the people
We're not corporations
We are the people
We're not labels for the stock
We are the people
We're not crayons in a box
We are the people
We're not donkeys and elephants

Now taking over from machines
Who you think you can trust
For the ballads that we play
Are like the bullets in a gun
Wake up and open you heart
And don't be deceived
Now when you see yourself for who you are
You'll be truly free

We are the people, oh
Listen to our song
We are the people
Together we are strong
We are the people
Stronger than one race
We are the people, yeah
Stronger the one fate
