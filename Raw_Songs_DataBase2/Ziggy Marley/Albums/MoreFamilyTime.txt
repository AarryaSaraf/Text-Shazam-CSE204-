// Play With Sky //

I'm goin' outside, gonna play with sky
I run outside and I play with sky
Running wild, play with sky
Waving high, it mystifies
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

Now a wondering breeze came blowing by
She said, "If you see the sun, don't look Him in the eye"
Goin' outside to play with sky, yeah
Just like the free birds love to fly
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

Let's clarify (clarify)
We play with sky (play with sky)
Eat blueberry pie (berry pie)
Play with the sky (play with sky)
Goin' outside (play with sky, play with sky)
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
Feel the vibe (play with sky)
If you are a rainbow, then you know why
I'm goin' outside, I'm gonna play with the sky

And now comes the sun
Wanna have some fun?
He said let's run
Run, run
To the edge of the sea
Where we say goodnight and good eve (good eve)
And when we're tired of stayin' inside
We goin' outside and we're playin' with the sky

(Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky
Come outside, play with sky)

// Music Is In Everything //

Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing

Tree dance as the wind blows
Clap your hands and you'll know
Music is in everything

Pots and pans they make good sound
Families now gather round
There's a concert Saturday afternoon (Saturday afternoon)
Join us in the kitchen
As we make our rhythm
Grandma, Grandpa you'll be dancing too (You'll be dancing too)
Make a rice shaker
Let's eat dinner later
Raindrops really locked into the groove (Locked into the groove)
Laughing is a nice sound
Spreading joy all around
Have you heard the river's latest tune?

Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing

The bee dance as the honey flows
Stomp your feet and you'll know
Music is in everything

Pots and pans they make good sound
Families now gather round
There's a concert Saturday afternoon (Saturday afternoon)
Join us in the kitchen
As we make our rhythm
Uncle, Auntie you'll be dancing too (You'll be dancing too)
Make a rice shaker
Let's eat dinner later
Raindrops really locked into the groove (Locked into the groove)
Laughing is a nice sound
Spreading joy all around
Have you heard the river's latest tune?

Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the ocean sing
Music is in everything
Listen to the birds, they sing

// Please Excuse Me Thank You //

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, may I have some candy?
Please, can I watch some TV?

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, can you roll down my window?
Please, can I have some tomorrow?

To say sorry is fine
Hey, we can laugh and cry at the same time
And when it's time for me to do
Remember magic words make dreams come true

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, I would like some pizza?
Please, may I have some ice cream?

Please, can I have that toy?
Please, let's live in joy

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Please, can I have a Madeline?
Please, it's not my bedtime

To say thank you is nice
When you ask and get the things I like
And when it's time for you to do
Remember magic words
Make your dreams come true

These are the words we use everyday
Please, excuse me, thank you
Thank you
