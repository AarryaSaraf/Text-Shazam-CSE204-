// Give A Little Love //

We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better

Whoa, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa

Livin' in this crazy world
So caught up in the confusion
Nothin' is makin' sense
For me and you

Maybe we can find a way
There's got be a solution
How to make a brighter day
What do we do

We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh, whoa, oh
We can really make it better, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la
Only if we try

Got the words on our minds
Got the troubles on our shoulders
Sometimes it seems so much
What we go through

Maybe if we take the time
Time to understand each other
You can learn to make it right
What do we do

We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

Oh, whoa, whoa
We can really make it better, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la
Only if we try

Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la
Give a little
Oh, ah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, la, la, la
Only if we try

(If everybody took somebody by the hand)
Come on, take him by the hand
(Then maybe everyone could learn to love and understand)

Oh, whoa, oh
We can really make it better, yeah
Oh, whoa, oh, la, la, la
Only if we try, sing it

Oh, whoa, oh, la, la, la
We can really make it better, yeah
Oh, whoa, oh
Only if we try

We got to give a little love, have a little hope
Make this world a little better
Try a little more, harder than before
Let's do what we can do together

// Hey World! //

Hey world, look around today, people
Do you see, do you see, do you see what you like
Do like what you see, hahaha, you better wake up
Come on!

Hey world, aren't you afraid
The fool called man is gonna blow you away
The situation is drastic
And the green grass is turning to plastic

Well, I'mma sayin'
Hey world, you better wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up

Pretty green forest are almost gone
Once happy animal sing a sad song
Air polluted it smug
Ocean's fill with oil and rain

Come on, hey
Hey world, you better wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up

Missile flying higher than high
Once fall mountains and so high
The bubbling roots have lost their bubbles
Check it out, huh, we're in trouble
Well, well it seems you don't even care
You came around you must be square

So we singing
Hey world, you better wake up
Wake up, wake up
Hey world, you got to wake up
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Hey world, you better, you better wake up

Hey world, aren't you afraid
The fool called man is gonna blow us away
The situation is drastic
And your green grass turning to plastic
Huh, come on

Believe me
Hey world, you better wake up
Believe me
Hey world, you got to wake up
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
You're gonna wake up
You're gonna shake up
Uh, you got to wake up
Ah, you got to shake up...

// Freedom Road //

That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
Marching down freedom's road
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me
From marching down freedom's road

Hand me my gun, let the bugle blow loud
I'm on my way with my head a-proud
One objective I've got in view
Is to keep a hold of freedom for me and you
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
Marching down freedom's road
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me
From marching down freedom's road

Ought to be plain as the nose on your face
There's room in this plan for every race
Some folk think that freedom just ain't right
Those are the very people I want to fight
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
Marching down freedom's road

Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me
From marching down freedom's road
Now, Hitler may rant, Hirohito may rave
I'm going after freedom if it leads me to my grave
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
I'm marching down freedom's road

United we stand, divided we fall
Let's make this land safe for one and all
I've got a message, and you know it's right
Black and white together unite and fight

That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
Marching down freedom's road
Ain't no fascists gonna stop me, no Nazis gonna keep me
From marching down freedom's road

No no
No shot

They say its done
Well but it is only began
Behind everyone's back
No fools get shot

And in Ethiopia
Military power turn them fools

We got to stop
This brutality

You gave the guns
Just to shoot a brother man
But, but when it was over
You put them in a slam

You only had one thing on your mind
That was to win the elections
Now now now that you've won
I said you said you can do whatever you want

But still
Down in South Africa

And in Ethiopia
Them thought fools

Get on a bus and leave the town, right now
