Album: WildAndFree

// Wild And Free //

A fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom
The smell of decent is I
I am standing for the truth
Too long has been denied
The data of changing is rising
I hope we realize
Unchained wings let angels fly

[Chorus:]
I see hemp fields forever
Growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in our breeze
I see hemp fields forever growing wild and free
Wild and free

A crime against nations
A war is waged there is a message
In the wind for every race
Peace and love we saw
So let us grow is good for the body
Is good for the soul

[Chorus]

So lost the kiss of death
Deny the tree of life
Stand hypocrisy for so many lies
Corporation greed can only see small farmers survive by planting weed

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Crucified savior to save your face
Demonized nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use
What the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree herbs of the fields
[Chorus]

// Forward To Love //

Don't go away, when you know that it feels good
Why don't you stay cause you know what we could do
Baby...
We could get hazy
Hand in hand we feel the vibe
We see true love in our eyes
Baby...
This ain't no maybe

[chorus]
Forward to love
Forward to love
I know we got something
The feeling is true
And I don't wanna wait another day
To be with you
Baby...
We could get lazy
The spirit has spoke
The voice of the truth
No need to waste time
Lets just do it
Baby...
We could get crazy
Yeah...

[chorus]
Forward to love
Forward to love
Hard to believe
It shouldn't be this easy
You take the lead
That I wont be greedy
Baby...
I'm in no hurry
What are the odds
A stranger we'll meet
But deep inside
We walked these streets already
And this ain't just lately
Yeah

[chorus]
Forward to love
I tell ya now
Forward to love

[instrumental solo]

Don't go away, when you know that it feels good
Why don't you stay cause you know what we could do
Baby..
We could get hazy
Hand in hand we feel the vibe
You see true love in my eyes
Baby...
This ain't no maybe
Ahh, yeah

[chorus]
Forward to love
Everyone now
Forward to love
Come on ya
Forward to love
Everybody sings
Forward to love
Right now
Forward to love
Forward to love
Forward to love
Yeah you're headed my way
Forward to love
Come on come on
Forward to love

// It //

lets go ziggy now them a pray for the riches and the gold but wont even pray for them soul ziggy

I hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try and find it do you know what it is
I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need

Not all that glitter is gold once a fool was told
Right before he sold his soul his soul
and a man made his money His money was on his mind
He got everything he wanted and he still wasn't satisfied

How you feel when you look in the mirror do you see a champion or a weakling
What's your thing what you chasing falsehood or fatherhood
Abandonment of parenthood I'm looking for something good
There's something bout the way you act the way you play the game
I love you smile and you don't look at life quite the same
Your attitude kinda make me want to really change
Look at things not the same but differently
You the best the worst of me the reverse the opposite of me
Your hospitality got me feeling quite free

Sitting in front of the big screen watching life go by
Wanna be like what you see every time you close your eyes
She's coming in from the cold she cant stand to be alone
He's looking for a hole what she needs is a home

Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need

A religious man is preaching. Said he found god
But he couldn't go to heaven until he found love
The people they are listening he caught them by surprise
He Confessed all his sins and he stop telling lies

I hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want i hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want hope you find what you need

Hope you find what you need

Hey yo push come to shove what happen to the love
What happen to the giving instead of taking my heart is breaking
To many greedy not giving to the needy
What happen to the pity when you walk through the inner city
Now where the love at where the hugs at
Nowadays everybody want to be a thug act
Too many materialistic ways and nowadays nobody love each other the same way

Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need
Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
I hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need

I Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need

One time and if the blind lead the blind then wha go happen to the whole mankind
You nuh know me say hope you find what you need

Ziggy ziggy ziggy and heavy heavy heavy and Ziggy Ziggy Ziggy them no ready ready

// Changes //

Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now
Changes, changes, yes
For ordinary people now

There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, won't you tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many, the wants of the few
We can find religion in the freedom we choose

There's so much hurt all over the place
Oh, can't you tell by the look on my face?
And there's one thing that I must convey

Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now, yeah
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now

I just can't help the way that I feel
We all want our dreams to be real
Yet circumstances that I just can't understand
Why does money got to make the man?

Everyone has an ego to feed
And every want is filled with greed
So here's one thing that I've got to say

Changes, changes, yeah, yeah
For ordinary people now
Yeah, changes, changes
For ordinary people now, y'all

Change for the better and not for the worse
Let's stand together and break our curses
We look off in the distance chasing dreams
But the things that I see with my eye's obscene

Let's plant a new tree, make a change
Need it for you and me, brighter days
Will come and you'll see, make the change
Necessary for ordinary people

There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many and the wants of the few
You can find religion in the freedom you choose

There's so much hurt all over the place
And I can tell by the look on your face
And there's one thing that we've got to say

Changes, changes
(Danny man say, brighten up your day and never feel no weight)
For ordinary people now

(Hear what we say, hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now

(Do you hear what we say? Do you hear what we say?)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now

(Can you hear what we say? Hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day, ain't gonna feel no pain)
For ordinary people now

// Personal Revolution //

I need I need a revolution. 
My own revolution
My very own revolution
I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Heartbreak is so hard to take
And I lay down in the bed that I make
Crying, crying, tears of change
Fighting, Fighting, everyday. 
There must be a better way
I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Baby I need, I need
A revolution, my own revolution
My personal revolution
Ay, I don't like the hypocrisy
Is this democracy?
There is no voice for me
In your philosophy
Tainted theology
Oh can you save me (who can save me)
Who can save me?
Revolution
Who gotta power, I do
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Cause heartbreak is so hard to take
And then I lay down in the bed that I make
Crying, crying, tears of change
I'm Fighting, Fighting, everyday
I know there must be a better way
So I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Babe I need, I need a revolution
My own revolution
My personal revolution
Who gotta power, I do
Who got the say, I do 
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way
Who gotta power, I do (yeah)
Who got the say, I do (yeah)
Who got the play, I do
I will find a way [x4]
Revolution,
My own revolution

// Get Out Of Town //

I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

I'm gonna catch the train I'll never play your game
My life isn't based on how much money I make
I wanna live in peace but it's hard today
There's always something trying to take it away
I rather change my situation than change who I am
Don't wanna hurt no one just to prove I'm a man
I wanna plant a little grass on a piece of land
And help this planet as best as I can

I've got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

I don't care bout the silver I don't care bout the gold
I don't care bout the sex with a heart that so cold
Misused by abuse and refused, refused by misuse and abuse
Hey where will I go nobody know
Maybe to Maui or maybe to Fiji or maybe to Ghana where my mama lives
Or way up to the Nine-mile hills

I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around

In this political rut oh who can you trust, Cause no ideology can ever control me
Who them you fool once, who them you fool twice
The silent majority everything's a conspiracy
Till you wake up one morning and the truth has dawned
Too late for most people they got stuck in the storm
Like a cub leaves the den a boy leaves his home
In search of a truth that must be found

// Roads Less Travelled //

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you again some day
I take the roads less travelled well I'm on my way

When I was a young boy people try to tell me what I should be
And then a wise man sang decide your own destiny
Aunty said choices you make chances you take
To be free to be free to be free I got to be brave

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day

Now my daddy had a lot of women and my mama had a lot of grief
And the brethrens that surrounded him became the enemies
Cause greed can't be satisfied by money and jealousy's a disease
Oh if you don't learn from history what a blind man see

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled see you again one day

The more I love the more hurt I feel
And that's all right by me cause that's just how I be
I could be like a brother sold out for a million dollar
I could be like a brother despising one another

And aunty said choices you make chances you take
And to be free to be free to be free you got to be brave

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way

// Mmmm Mmmm //

The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Judgment will return my friends to give justice to the land

mmm mmm

The vows are upon me I've surrendered myself
And I pray that you would see not all that is sad
Awake up my glory awake my guitar
Play me songs of mercy cause the world has gone too far

mmm mmm

Why should my liberty be judged by another man
Why would I listen to the voices on the stand
By the fruits of your tree I know who you are

mmm mmm

The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Justice will return my friends to give judgment to the land

Mmm mmm

// Welcome To The World //

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the world I cant promise it's a good place
Welcome to the world I cant promise it's a cool place

I could tell you stories I tell you the truth
I could sugar coat it try to make you the fool
And soon you'll see anyway that this is life
And soon you'll see anyway that you got to fight

[Chorus]

I could give you roses for you to make your bed
But this bed of roses is only in your head
Cause every rose has its thorn
And every ego has its wants

I don't know when innocence is lost
And I don't know when you pay the cost
Well if your back is against the wall
You've got to stand for who you are

[Chorus]

People are suffering children have no food
Keep your eyes wide open check the golden rule
The love inside will make you cry
The fight inside will make you try

[Chorus]

// A Sign //

I tell you everyday no don't walk that way
Do you hear a word I say
Cause you keep going on and you keep living wrong
There's a price to be paid

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry

Go on walk out the door just remember the seeds you sow
Are the fruits that you reap
Now you been told before don't act like you don't know
When the truth speaks

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign
Maybe you need to maybe you need to maybe you need to cry

I tell you everyday please don't walk that way
Do you hear a word I say

Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign maybe you need to cry
Maybe you need a sign maybe you need a sign
Maybe you need a maybe you need a maybe you need a sign

// Reggae In My Head //

Yeah reggae in my head, reggae in my head, reggae in my head
Sitting by the river listening to her songs
She played it all night long
She brought me from defeat hypnotized by the beat
On the rocks I made my bed she played reggae in my head

Reggae in my head, reggae in my head, reggae in my head
Cities of oppression there is no imagination
Oh to be wild and free again
A world without dreams is lost it seems
In the prison of known realities so I say

I got reggae in my head, reggae in my head, I put reggae in my head
Oh what a wonderful world this could be only if we live in peace
Dancing to this vibration this is my emotion
Sitting by the river listening to her songs
She played it all night long
She brought me from defeat hypnotized by the beat

On the rocks I made my bed, she played reggae in my head
Reggae in my head, reggae in my head, reggae in my head
I got reggae in my head, reggae in my head, I want reggae in my head
I got reggae in my head, I need reggae in my head, reggae in my head

// Elizabeth //

Uncle Sam is a naughty old man
He says he wants you but he only wants to use you
He has a woman named Elizabeth she walk the streets selling her body for Glory, immorality
They get drunk from the blood of saints not the kind that are made into statues
Her brother john drinks wine all day he and his friends trying to take our souls away
Oh it's sad to say but uncle sam is gonna have his day they will weep for Elizabeth

Uncle Sam is a naughty old man

Oh it's sad to say but uncle sam is gonna have his day they will weep for Elizabeth
They will weep for Elizabeth
I will weep for Elizabeth
