// Into The Groove //

Into the groove, where we lose ourselves just to find who we are
into the groove, where we get to fly but we need not see the sky
into the groove, where we escape from the surface of what we've become
into the groove, come for the ride

Take the plunge, soak it up like a sponge
don't be afraid of tonight, everything is gonna be alright
take the plunge, soak me up like a sponge
don't be afraid of the light, everything is gonna be just fine

Into the groove, where love grows to new heights
into the groove, where the sun disappears but a light still shines
into the groove, surrounded by the waters of desire, yeah
into the groove, come for the ride

Catch the wave, free the slave, emancipate your mind
cause nothing men do can change this time
catch the wave (I'm gonna catch the wave), and free your slave (I'm gonna free my slave)
emancipate your mind, hey nothin' they do can change this time

Light it up

Into the groove, where we lose ourselves just to find who we are
into the groove, where we get to fly but we need not see the sky
into the groove, where we escape from the surface of what we've become
into the groove, come for the ride

Yeah, come for the ride

// Love Is My Religion //

Love is my religion, Love is my religion, Love is my religion
I'll take you to the temple tonight

All my days I've been searching, to find out what this life is worth
through the books and bibles of time I've made up my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert, this is a calling have you heard
bring all the lovers to the fold, cause no one is gonna lose their soul

[Chorus:]
Love is my religion (Love is my religion) 
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
hey you can take it or leave it, and you don't have to believe it

I don't want to fight, hey let's go fly a kite
there's nothing that we can't cure, and I'll keep you in my arms for sure
so don't let nobody stop us, free spirits have to soar
with you I share the gift, the gift that we now know oh oh oh

[Chorus]

Well I'm done searching now, I found out what this life is worth
not in the books that I find, but by searching my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert
this is the calling have you heard, bring all the lovers to the fold
no one is gonna lose their soul

Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
Hey you can take it or leave, and you dont have to believe it

[Chorus: fades out]

// Make Some Music //

Love is a melody playing through eternity, making sweet songs all night long
stay in the groove, we can't refuse when the rhythm is tight we'll be up all night
the perfect tune we make for life beats that vibrate moods that excite
instruments tuned, harmonies right
love is the song we make tonight

Come on baby lets make some music, this is the groove and that's how I do it
come on baby lets make some music, cause you know how, how to do it

Thinking of lyrics I could sing, but I know they must come from within
can't rush music got to take it slow keep in the groove till it starts to flow
hit the right tempo then you know, this song is not for the show

[Chorus]

It's a beautiful thing the way you hit the way we swing
the way we rock this groove
now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots
hey It's a beautiful thing the way we hit the way we swing
the way we rock this groove
now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots

[Chorus]

// Friend //

I wanna thank you for the things you've done
I wanna thank you for your generosity
and I'll never be alone, that's because, that's because you are my friend
that's because, that's because you are my friend

Been through thick and thin together
through the ups and downs, yet we still remain
and I can talk to you forever

[Chorus]

Before I met you, I was real low, now everyone know
now that I know you hey I'm real high
I wanna thank you for the day and nights
I wanna thank you for the breath of life
without you I'd be lost

[Chorus]

Just as long, just as long as you're my friend
just as long, just as long as you're my friend
that's because you are my friend, you are my friend

// Black Cat //

Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight

Black cat one day things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name
my friend tells me you're no good, and I say hey I'm not afraid

Black cat you're beautiful, why does everybody run away
has anybody told you, I care
has anybody told you, I love you

Black cat come visit me, I don't care what people say
I saw your hazel eyes, sparkling in the moonlight
black cat things will change, I'm gonna wipe away your bad name
black cat you're beautiful, black cat, black cat

// Beach In Hawaii //

On the beach in Hawaii

I wish you were here with me, walking on the beach in Hawaii
Playing on the golden sand, looking at the ocean now I understand
Love is like the open sea, and I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii

Since you've been gone away, I think about you everyday
Don't you know I miss you much, and you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff, oh I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii

A little pakalolo, and I say mahalo
Ujjayi breathing, to get a real feeling
Yogi gonna let you know
That I wish you were here with me
On the beach in Hawaii
In Hawaii

// Be Free //

The system's got too much control, and they don't wanna let it go
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, I'm breaking out of captivity

Be free, be free
To be free

Little by little, I'm losing control
As little by little my rights erode
I stop the deputy, now you know
Mama don't try, you see I got to go

[Chorus]

The government's got too much control,
Now is there some place that we can roll
the politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now
the law is closing in, just take what you can bring

[Chorus]

The system's got too much control,
now is there some place that we can roll
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, the law is closing in
just take what we can bring

// Keep On Dreaming //

When you left me, I didn't cry, but my heart was heavy
as heavy as lead
I sit there thinking with no thoughts in my head
I could not be comforted, by the living or the dead

So I keep on dreaming to communicate
and I keep on dreaming if that's what it take
keep on dreaming, it's never too late
keep on dreaming, cause that's what it take

I see you in my visions, and it seems you're right here
I wish I didn't have to wake up, but here comes the light of day
it's been too long now, since you went away
won't you come back, so we can play

[Chorus]

I knew it wasn't over, it was only the start
cause I see the light that shines in the dark
the questions have answers, my love isn't lost
fate put us together, so nothing can tear us apart

[Chorus]

// Still The Storm //

With the world so loud, who's gonna hear, when I cry
in this fog of war for black gold, one diamond sold, one life got stole
society built on slavery, for me it was not so long ago
you may forget, but I still know

Still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [repeat]
anger and rage, thunder and lightning, spirits unrest hey they looking for justice
still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [repeat]
flood of tears rise, for stories untold, a debt to be paid, hey don't you know

There heroes, are my enemies for one man's profit is another man's loss
and I see their faces in stone and steel with eyes so proud, oh I wish they could feel
for I am come, with the chain and ball to shatter your images, and break down these walls
so this day may be bright free from the shadows of giants in the light
I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]

Eternity is not enough for me to forget, and my children's children, you will regret
for I warn you of a time when empires fall, and the lowly will be lifted hey rule them all
but vengeance is no glory, hate is no pay, truth is my call and peace is my way
so I will endure, through these hard times, while I am neglected and paid no mind

[Chorus]
