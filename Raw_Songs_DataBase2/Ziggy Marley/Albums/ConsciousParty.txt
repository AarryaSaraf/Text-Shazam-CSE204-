// Conscious Party //

Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

No booze to lick our head
Now we can't lose in life way
No booze to lick our head
Got to stay a light in darkness
And everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
But not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

Spirit of Jah passes through
I can feel him, so can you! Yeah
Makes one want to get up and dance
I said we're jammin' on this love and chant
Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
But it's not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

Everyone, and Jah-a-everyone

I get smiles of Happiness
Jahlification a dances
Brothers loving their sisters...
Sisters loving their brothers

Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of your world
And how could there be any fight
In such a Conscious Party
Everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
And how could there be any fight
In such a Conscious Party?

No booze to lick our head
Now we can't lose in life way
No booze to lick our head
Got to stay a light in darkness
And everyone is happy tonight
But not because of the world
It's not because of the world
And I know there'll be no fight
In such a Conscious Party

// Tomorrow People //

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?

Today you say you deyah
Tomorrow you say you're gone
But you're gone so long
If there is no love in your heart - so sorry
Then there is no hope for you - true, true

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?

So you're in the air
But you still don't have a thing to spare
You're flying high
While we're on the low o-o-oh

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Tell me now
Tomorrow people, where is your past? No where
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Ten years!

Stop tellin' me the same story
Today you say you deyah
Tomorrow you say you're gone and you're not coming back
If there is no love in your heart oh now
There will never be hope for you

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last? Ten years!
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, come on 
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, come on 
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, no soon come
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, soon come
Tomorrow people, tomorrow people, today is here

If you don't know your past, you don't know your future
Everyone
Don't know your past, don't know your future everyman
Don't know your past, don't know your future, come on
Don't know your past, don't know your future

How many nations
How many people did that one catch
How many nations did that one catch
Don't know past, don't know your future
Don't know past, don't know your future

Why didn't you give to the poor
Now you got to cry
Oh guity! And tell me

Have you ever been to hell, blasphemers!
Have you ever been to hell and hell again (oh)?
Have you ever been to hell murderers!
Have you ever been to hell guilty ones!

Earth conquers bone

So, have you ever been to hell?
Have you ever been to hell guilty one!
Have you ever been to hell again? Liars!
Have you ever been to hell pushers?
Now, have you ever been to hell?

Souldds are bought and sold

Have you ever been to hell murderers!
Have you ever been to hell again arm your souls

Have you ever been now
So have you been
Ever ben to hell and hell, and hell

Guilty ones, murderers, top notch
Have you ever been
Said I never been, never ever been

// We Propose //

Callin' callin' callin'
Warnin' warnin' warnin'

We propose to live up our life
We propose to do what is right
We propose to free our people
We propose to live in Africa

This mess, yes we detest
Controlled by another hand
They're puppets, they're just some puppets
Their thing's just a puppet show

So we propose all people be free
We propose equality for you and me
We propose politicians know this
We propose united (so)

You confess to your wickedness (I said)
The people already know
Protest is not enough
For the blood that flows (that's why)

We propose to be freedom fighters
We propose because we are all nighters
We propose to lick them down
We propose to free Africa

Yes, it's very serious, not delirious
The things that we say
Now let me hear the music sound
For sure we're gonna stick around

We propose...
We propose all people must be free
We propose let music be free
We propose we're gonna do what is right (whoa)

This is not a request
We propose ghetto youth live right
We propose stop fight
We propose politicnas learn this right now
We propose free Africa

'Cause we're tired of talkin'...listen to the people
Tired of balkin'...this is not a request
Tired of gamin'...listen to the people
Tired of playin'...listen to the people

We propose politicians learn, learn, learn
We propose warmongers learn, learn, learn
We propose fascists learn, learn, learn
Open your ears... listen to the people

We propose...
No one is perfect in this un-perfect world

// What's True //

There are many stories (2 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (too too true, what is true?)

There are many stories (3 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (what's true, what's true, what's true)

Christopher Columbus discovered whom? (uh-uh)
If their leader is closer to God (who? who?)
Who is for whom?
Are they doing the right thing
For who? for who? for who?

There are many stories (2 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (too too true, what is true?)

There are many stories (3 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (what's true, what's true, what's true)

So men say they're doing their best
To put the people on the line
They say we're livnin' in their time
Not true, not true, not true

There are many stories (2 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (too too true, what is true?)

There are many stories (3 many)
Both old and new
But what is true? (what's true, what's true, what's true)

Did you know the name of the slave ship (save me lord)
That carried us through and through?
Did you know they change things?
But they can't change me or you, me or you

There are many stories (2 many)
Both old and new
What is true? (too too true, what is true?)

There are many stories (3 many)
Both old and new
What is true, what is true? (what's true, what's true, what's true)
What's true, what's true, what's true

Plain truth without no sugar
Plain truth
Just the plain truth, no preservatives
Plain truth
100% raw truth, is what we need
Raw truth is what we feel
Raw truth without your sugar
Plain truth

// Dreams Of Home //

We're having dreams of home
And you know we're not alone
Dreams of home
And I know we're not alone

Look how long we've been away
How long are we going to stay?
Look how long we've been away from home
How long are we going to roam?

Dreams of home
And I know we're not alone
Having dreams, having visions
Having dreams, having visions
Why can't we people see
Why can't we people see
This is not where we belong?
And there is a holy land

Dreams of home
Having dreams, having visions
This ain't no fantasy
Prophecy
Ain't nothin' strange
Life must be rearranged

Dreams of home
And I know we're not alone

And if you don't believe
I wish you well, I wish you well
And if you don't believe
I wish you well, I wish you well
