// América Vibra //

América vibra
América vibra
América vibra
América, América!

Testify and bring to justice
The trees they've fallen
I am a witness
If the future's not bright
Then I will make it
I can't sit around and take it, ay yeah

América vibra (come on)
América vibra (yeah, yeah, step, keep goin')
América vibra (ay)
América, América (yeah, yeah)

Os mesmos pensamentos tortos do passado
Voltaram outra vez
Para tentarem sequestrar todos direitos
Que o pobre povo tem
Nossos sonhos são tão grandes que não cabem
Nos porões dessa ignorância
E a consciência do que somos e podemos é o fogo da esperança

América vibra
América vibra (oh, I)
América vibra (yeah)
América, América (yeah, yeah)

No queremos muros, nosotros somos puentes
No queremos hambre, nosotros somos vida
No queremos armas, nosotros somos paz
No queremos odio, no queremos odio
Nosotros somos amor (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

América vibra (vibra, vibra, vibra, yeah, yeah)
América vibra (América, yeah, yes)
América vibra (I get ya vibra)
América, América

Oh yah man, oh
Oh yah man
Oh yah man

// Believe In Yourself (Arthur Theme Song) //

Every day when you're walking down the street
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view

And I say, "Hey!"
What a wonderful kind of day
Where you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other

You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street

Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together
And make things better
By working together

It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself (believe in yourself)
Well, that's the place to start (to start)

And I say, "Hey!"
What a wonderful kind of day
Where you learn to work and play
And get along with each other

Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
What a wonderful kind of day
Hey!

// Could You Be Loved //

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman
(Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?)

Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no
We've got a life to live
They say: only - only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive! Eh

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something
(Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something! (Say something!)
Say something! Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Say something! Reggae, reggae
Say something! Rockers, rockers
Say something! Reggae, reggae
Say something! Rockers, rockers
Say something! (Could you be loved?)
Say something! Uh
Say something! Come on
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?)
Say something! (Could you be - could you be loved?)

// Free To Be...A Family //

We're all branches of the same family tree
But every family's different, don't you know?
Reaching for the sun comes very naturally
We've only got to let each other grow

I've got a home
I've found my place
I live with people
Who are glad to see my face

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

We're all working in the same big marching band
But drums and horns have different things to say
All together we'll ring music through the land
We've only got to let each other play

I've got a place
I've found my home
I'm only solo
When I want to be alone

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

So many groups in the family soup
So many combinations
Might be people who look like you
Or they might be no relation

Birds of a feather, they flock together
Yes, sometimes they do
But if a little bird joins an elephant herd
Hey, that's a family, too

We're all cooking up the same big barbeque
But we like spicy, you like sticky sweet
Maybe we can trade our recipe with you
Then how about we help each other eat

This is my home
These are my folks
These are our secrets
And our habits and our jokes

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

// HOME //

Roller coaster
Got me up down
Last night under neon lights
So late, so long
In a new day with an old song
Sunrise, red eyes, it's time

Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath, I see
New faces every day
But one place I cannot forget
Deep in the crowd now
But still feel alone
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
Make my way back

So Jah, I know
I'll find a place someday
Don't know how I'm gonna make it there
I know I'll go
On a wing and prayer
Sunrise, red eyes, it's time

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath, I see
New faces every day
But one place I cannot forget
Deep in the crowd now
But still feel alone
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back

Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me
Oh, it's been calling me, calling me, calling me, oh-oh
It's been pulling me, pulling me

Tired of running away
Tired of holding my breath
Tired of running away

Time to make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
Make my way back
Make my way back home
(Find my way back home
Find my way back home
Oh Lord)
Got to find my way back home

// Lyin' In Bed //

Praise god I say, praise god each day
He helped me to overcome
I remember once I couldn't get out of bed
So I sing and say... yeah

Lying in bed got nothin' to do
No one to rub my head
Playing my guitar my only friend
It's gonna last me till the end
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity

Above my bed bob face us all
Looking at me so passionately
Well in his eyes I saw the truth
The truth of a rastaman
The truth of a higher man

To the bridge
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Well I got lots and lots of company yeah
Alot of good vibes flowing around me
Nurses coming and wondering, o god
Is this really Ziggy Marley

Lying in bed got nothin' to do
No one to rub my head
Strumming my guitar my only friend
It's gonna last me till the end

Above my bed bob face us all, my daddy
Looking at me so passionately, lil brother
Well in his eyes I saw the truth, my name
The truth of a rastaman
The truth of a higherman

Rastafari no, I n I give praises
I n I thank Jah for, his health
If it was not for him
What would I, what would I've done
So I say amen

Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity

// The Lucky One //

I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one

I never knew true love could be true
Till I got my eyes on you
Wondering how it feels so right
Opening up my mind tonight
A little bit'll take me a long way
I get my blessings every day
Wondering how it feels so nice
Opening up my heart tonight

I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one

Ay
Taking in the feelings I won't define
You are the light that makes me shine
Living in a world that's full of lies
Only the real one will survive
Nobody, nobody really knows
How this love started to grow
They sit and wonder all the time
How we lit in this story of mine

I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one
I am the lucky one, yeah
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
She said it
She said she is lucky, I said no, I'm the lucky one
