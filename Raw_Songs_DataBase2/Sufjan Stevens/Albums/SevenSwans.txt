Album: SevenSwans

// All The Trees Of The Field Will Clap Their Hands //

If I am alive this time next year
will I have arrived in time to share?
And mine is about as good this far
And I'm still applied to what you are

And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you

And I heard from the trees a great parade
And I heard from the hills a band was made
And will I be invited to the sound?
And will I be a part of what you've made?

And I am throwing all my thoughts away
And I'm destroying every bet I've made
And I am joining all my thoughts to you
And I'm preparing every part for you

// The Dress Looks Nice On You //

I can see a lot of life in you
I can see a lot of bright in you
And I think the dress looks nice on you
I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a bed and make it too
I can see a fireside turn blue
And I can see the lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

When the world looks back
when the face looks after that
I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you
I can see your bed and make it too
And I think the dress looks nice on you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

I can see a lot of life in you
Yes, I can see a lot of life in you

// In The Devil's Territory //

Be still and know your sign
The beast will arrive in time
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time

To see you
To beat you
To see you
At last

I saw the dragons drying
I saw the witches whine
We stayed a long, long time
But I'm not afraid to die

To see you
To meet you
To see you
At last

I stole my father's shoes
I pulled his pockets too
We stayed a long, long time
We stayed a long, long time

To see you
To beat you
To see you
To meet you

To see you
At last

// To Be Alone With You //

I'd swim across Lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

To be alone with me you went up on a tree
I've never known a man who loved me

// Abraham //

Abraham
Worth a righteous one
Take up on the wood
Put it on your son

Lake or lamb
There is none to harm
When the angel came
You had raised your arm

Abraham
Put off on your son
Take instead the ram
Until Jesus comes

// Sister //

What the water wants is hurricanes
And sailboats to ride on its back
What the water wants is sun kiss
And land to run into and back

I have a fish stone burning my elbow
Reminding me to know that I'm glad
That I have a bottle filled with my old teeth
They fell out like a tear in the bag

And I have a sister somewhere in Detroit
She has black hair and small hands
And I have a kettledrum
I'll hit the earth with you

And I will crochet you a hat
And I have a red kite
I'll put you right in it
I'll show you the sky

// Size Too Small //

I was the best man in a size too small
You were my best friend, going at it all
And what if I put off my inheritance?
Where is the best man? All arise us all in peace

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
And I still owe you

Everything rises, going at it all
All the surprises in a size too small
And what if I told you I was still in love with this?
Would you surprise us in a size for all of me?

I still know you
And I still like you, the best man
I still know you, the best man
I still owe you

// We Won't Need Legs To Stand //

So faithful, so few
So pardon and done
And when we receive
We give a change at last

And when we are dead, we all have wings
We won't need legs to stand
And when we receive
To see a change at last

// A Good Man Is Hard To Find //

Once in the backyard, she was once like me
She was once like me
Twice when I killed them, they were once at peace
They were once like me
Hold to your gun, man and put off all your peace
Put off all the beast

Paid a full of these
I wait for it, but someone's once like me
She was once like me

I once was better, I put off all my grief
I put off all my grief
And so I go to hell, I wait for it but someone's left me creased
And someone's left me creased

// He Woke Me Up Again //

He was, he was in the churchyard
My father was in the first part
He came, he came to my bedroom
But I was asleep

And he woke me up again to say...

Halle, halle, hallelujah
Holy, holy is the sound
And I hope, I hope you are tired out
And I know, I know there is joy endowed

But I was asleep
And he woke me up again
And he woke me up again to say...

Hold on, hold on to your old ways
Or put off, put off every old face
And I know, I know you are changed out
And I hope, I hope you're arranged out

But I'm still asleep
And you woke me up again
And I'm still asleep
But you woke me up to be holy

// Seven Swans //

We didn't sleep too late
There was a fire in the yard
All of the tress were in light
They had no faces to show

I saw a sign in the sky
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
I heard a voice in my mind
I will try, I will try, I will try

I will try, I will try, I will try

We saw the dragon move down
My father burned into coal
My mother saw it from far
She took her purse to the bed

I saw a sign in the sky
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns
I heard a voice in my mind
I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord

He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord
He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord

He will take you
If you run, He will chase you
He will take you
If you run, He will chase you

'Cause He is the Lord
'Cause He is the Lord

Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans

// The Transfiguration //

When he took the three disciples to the mountainside to pray
His countenance was modified, his clothing was aflame
Two men appeared, Moses and Elijah came
They were at his side
The prophecy, the legislation spoke
Of whenever he would die

Then there came a word of what he should accomplish on the day
Then Peter spoke, to make of them a tabernacle place
A cloud appeared in glory as an accolade
They fell on the ground
A voice arrived, the voice of God
The face of God covered in a cloud

What he said to them, the voice of God, the most beloved son
Consider what he says to you, consider what's to come
The prophecy was put to death, was put to death
And so will the son
And keep your word, disguise the vision
Till the time has come

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Have no fear, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, turn your ear

Lost in the cloud, a voice
Lamb of God, we draw near
Lost in the cloud, a sign
Son of man, son of God

// I Went Dancing With My Sister //

We were, we were 
We were lovers
We had no one
But armed puppets

We were touching
We were turning
We were eighteen
Get to learning

Saw your mother 
At the river washing ribbons
Saw her sip, saw her sip the East River

I've seen laid men up and walking
I've seen deaf and dead men talking

And I have had enough of trouble
I've been paid in full and double

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're able

I went dancing with my sister
Call her madam, call me mister

She wore a dress
It was nice and something
Underneath her dress was slipping

She did curse it, she did keep it
She said she did something stupid

I said: who's the master, Mira?
I can't kill or catch a fly dead

Point me in the right direction
Point me to the middle section

And I have had enough of trouble
I've been paid in full and double

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're able

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're, if you're able

// Waste Of What Your Kids Won't Have //

Mad he was, inward
Break her barn, back door

When the water rushed and poured
Took the relatives she stored
So the Father Ghost and Lord 
Took the revelation stored

It's a waste of money spent and given
It's a waste of what was, when forgiven
And your children burn their backs in bed
It's a waste of what your kids won't have

When the man took his gun 
Put it on your youngest one
Took the curtains off the glass
Took the virgin for what she has

It's a waste of money spent and given
It's a waste of what was, when forgiven
And your children burn their backs in bed
It's a waste of what your kids won't have

It's a waste of what your kids won't have
It's a waste of what your kids won't have
