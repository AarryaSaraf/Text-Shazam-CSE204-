// O Come, O Come, Emmanuel //

O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!

O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!

O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height,
In ancient times did'st give the Law,
In cloud, and majesty and awe.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!
Rejoice! Rejoice! Rejoice!

// We're Goin' To The Country! //

If you seek a pillow for your head
Or a fitted sheet for Christmas bed
If you see your shadow on the snow
Is it from the baby Jesus glow?
He's going to the country

Find a tree and put in your house
Put a misletoe upon your mother's blouse
If you see a woman dressed in black
Give her up a song and then ask for it back
We're going to the country
We're going to the country
You're mom's going to the country
We're going to the country
The country

// It's Christmas! Let's Be Glad! //

Since it's Christmas, let's be glad
Even if your life's been bad
There are presents to be had

Take a walk out in the snow
And hear Santa's "Ho ho ho!"
He's got a million miles to go

La la la la la la ah

Sing a carol to your mom
Because she knows what's going on
And she knows if you've been bad or good

And if you get what you deserve
To be graded on the curve
Oh, you got a lot of nerve

La la la la la la ah

Since the year is almost out
Left your hands and give a shout
There's a lot to shout about today

Since it's Christmas, let's be glad
Even if the year's been bad
There are presents to be had
A promotion for your dad
Don't be angry don't be mad

// Amazing Grace //

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
