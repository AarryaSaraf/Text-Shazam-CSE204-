// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night 
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born

// Angels We Have Heard On High //

Angels we have heard on high
Singing for the earth's attention
And the mountains in reply
So much noise for my affection

Shepherds, why this jubilee
Have you seen a flying saucer?
And what the gladsome tidings be
Is it power and wealth you're after?

Gloria, it speaks of pure devotion
Gloria, the counting and commotion
Gloria, I cannot stand to listen
Gloria, it takes from my ambition
Gloria

Come to Bethlehem and see
The Son of God inside a manger
Come, adore on bended knee
Where dreams become your greatest danger

Gloria, it puts your heart in motion
Gloria, like some romantic notion
Gloria, it gives a great petition
Gloria, and takes from your ambition
Gloria

Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria

// Hark! The Herald Angels Sing //

Hark the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!" 

Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell
Jesus, our Immanuel

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"

// Joy To The World //

Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove 
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders, of his love

Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
Boy, we can do much more together

Do you see what I see?

// Jingle Bells //

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Hahaha

Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

// Lumberjack Christmas / No One Can Save You From Christmases Past //

Oh, no, the rugged soul
The great backyard and the cold North Pole
I resent that Santa went and
Left us in the Alamo
Would you like to stay a while and dance with me?
Would you like to wrap the gifts and have a drink?

The only condition (I know the one)
I've got the premonition (I've got a clue)
That Christmas is a vision (For Christmas)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
If drinking makes it easy (So pass one here)
The music's kinda cheesy (And sing a cheer)
The specials on the TV (Especially)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

Dreams go and stay below
The cattle call and the old dark soul
I respect that Santa left
To save his kids from the winter cold
Would you like to stay a while and dance with me?
Mistletoe and chestnuts roasting on the street

The only condition (I know the one)
I've got the premonition (I've got a clue)
That Christmas is a vision (For Christmas)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho
If drinking makes it easy (So pass one here)
The music's kinda cheesy (And sing a cheer)
The specials on the TV (Especially)
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho

No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last
No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last
No one can save you from Christmases past
You'll have to love it or leave it at last

// Coventry Carol //

Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay

O sisters too, how may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor youngling for whom we sing
Bye, bye, lully, lullay

Herod, the king, in his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men of might, in his own sight
All children young, to slay

Lullay, Thou little tiny Child
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
For thy parting neither say nor sing
Bye, bye, lully, lullay
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee!
Bye, bye, lully, lullay

// The Midnight Clear //

It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious sign of old
Enraptured secret sign of fear 
In brave disguises

Old shoes and thirty feet
The prophet's sign of prophecy
I resign to petty things
Like angels bending on their knees

Do you delight, do you delight, in me
I laughed about it
Come to me now, come to now, and bring
That rapture's moment
I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit
Though you may doubt it
I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care
To ask about it

The dead of winter takes a grip
And moves around us
All night our labors clap and kiss
Like working mothers

Old wounds and thirty feet
The clock it sounds of properties
I resign to glorious things
Like angels bending on their knees

Do you delight, do you delight, in me
I laughed about it
Come to me now, come to now, and bring
That rapture's moment
I wasn't changed, I wasn't changed, one bit
Though you may doubt it
I don't suppose, I don't suppose, you'd care
To ask about it

I will delight, I will delight, in this
Though you may doubt it
Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss
And ask about it

I will delight, I will delight, in this
Though you may doubt it
Come to me now, come to me now, my kiss

// Carol Of St. Benjamin The Bearded One //

I can see you there
Oh, in the snowbank
With a snowman at your side
In my heart and in my spirit I concede
The things you want in life you have to really need
This is a matter of life

Only parents cry
Oh, when they want to 
Show the world they're still alive
And in my heart and in my spirit I believe
The draft beneath the doorframe comes to challenge me
This is a matter of life 

Oh, be kind to me
Oh, Benjamin who
Keeps his hands inside his sleeves
And in my heart and in my spirit I can read
The way he brushed his beard against the cedar tree
Keeping his eyes upon me

I can see you there
Oh, in the snowbank
With a snowman at your side
And in my heart and in my spirit I can see
The things you want in life you have to really need

// Barcarola (You Must Be A Christmas Tree) //

Oh, no one else is happily
Recklessly asking for more than
What they may need
I can't say what I need

Oh, temper what you say if you've
Nothing nice to say
So my grandmother says to me
With her heart on her sleeve

So, sadly I left the door
Open and I let the dog out in the snow
Oh where did she go?

Oh, father friend, will you punish me, punish me
With a look of contempt, with a look of contempt
I can recall

Oh, I know you did right by me, right by me
Wagging your hands when you found me
With a bag of your things

Please, please don't be a stranger here
A stranger who takes from the world
Who takes from the world

You, you must be a Christmas tree, a Christmas tree
You light up the room, oh, you light up the room
Oh you light up the room

So, suddenly you kiss me
You tickled me in front of your mother
Who looked away
With her hands on her face

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know that you needed yourself to be cleaned of me

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know that you needed yourself to be cleaned of me

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You ran your hands through my hair in the snow
Where the frost of it blows with the terrible ghost

Don't run away my friend
You won't be back again
You said you needed me
But I know...

// Auld Lang Syne //

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

// Christmas Woman //

Christmas is the time of year
When the patrons and the panthers
Come and commandeer
Christian, put away your fuss
With the tipping of the handlers
As the pagans must

I know for a century
We were scrambling to assemble
What a man believes
I know for a time I let
To believe that human kindness
Would prevail instead

Woman, have you lost your kind?
There are snakeskin stealers
Seething in the afterlife
Christian in the advent house
You confess the incarnation
With the breast turned out

Have you seen the Christ the king
Suckling nurseries in snakeskin
In the armored seat?
Christian, put away your woes
Welcome grief and crime and anguish
With the happiest host

Oh, I was thinking by myself
I was remembering
Every moment by the river
When it froze last night

And in the fullness of the moon
I felt the baby kick beside me
She was grabbing happy, healthy life

I lived it out to be a soldier
I was channeling Middle Ages
I was captured by the Norsemen rite

The sign that passeth comprehending
She was tending right beside me
She was captured in the midst of men

And then it kissed me on my shoulder
All the possibilities of motion
Resting rightly, right inside of me

// Break Forth O Beauteous Heavenly Light //

Break forth O beauteous heavenly light
And usher in the morning
Ye shepherds, shrink not with afright
But hear the angel's warning
This child now weak in infancy
Our confidence and joy shall be
The power of Satan breaking
Our peace eternal making

// Happy Family Christmas //

1, 2, and 1 2 3 4

Just this once for Christmas
I want us all to be
Like one great big happy
Family
Family

Bam, bam bam, badadam bam bam

// Lift Up Your Heads Ye Mighty Gates //

Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates
Behold, the King of glory waits
The King of kings is drawing near
The Savior of the world is here

O blest the land, the city blest
Where Christ the Ruler is confessed
O happy hearts and happy homes
To whom this King in triumph comes

// We Wish You A Merry Christmas //

We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

Now bring us a figgy pudding
Now bring us a figgy pudding
Now bring us a figgy pudding and a cup of good cheer

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year

// Ah Holy Jesus //

Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended
That we to judge thee have in hate pretended? 
By foes derided, by thine own rejected
O most afflicted

For me, kind Jesus, was thine incarnation
Thy mortal sorrow, and thy life's oblation
Thy death of anguish and thy bitter passion
For my salvation

Alright let's do a real song.

// How Shall I Fitly Meet Thee? //

How shall I fitly meet Thee
And give Thee welcome due?
The nations long to greet Thee
And I would greet Thee too
O Fount of light, shine brightly
Upon my darken'd heart
That I may serve Thee rightly
And know Thee as Thou art

// Mr. Frosty Man //

It's time to tango with the frisky, frosty Frosty Man
He's got a temperature of negative degrees again
He likes ice cream and Yo La Tengo with the jammin' pants
You got to cool it with the hipster costly Frosty Man
He's chillin', illin', thrillin' with the Mr. Saucy Pants
He likes to keep it real, he likes to talk a little sense
He's got a friend called Coolio, Vanilla Ice, and Ice Cube
Banana split and frozen pie and Mr. Frosty Pants

Mr. Frosty Man
Frosty, Frosty, Frosty, Frosty
Frosty Man

Don't get his goat, he just might melt, and then he gets all mean
When summer comes, he sits beside the air conditioning
But, Mr. Frosty, don't be bossy, winter's coming soon
And when it snows again, Frosty

// Ah Holy Jesus (With Reed Organ) //

Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended
That we to judge thee have in hate pretended? 
By foes derided, by thine own rejected
O most afflicted

For me, kind Jesus, was thine incarnation
Thy mortal sorrow, and thy life's oblation
Thy death of anguish and thy bitter passion
For my salvation

// Idumea (Sacred Harp) //

And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown
And must my trembling spirit fly
Into a world unknown

A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot
The dreary regions of the dead
Where all things are forgot

Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be

Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be
Eternal happiness or woe
Must then my portion be

// Ah Holy Jesus (A Capella) //

Ah, holy Jesus, how hast thou offended
That we to judge thee have in hate pretended? 
By foes derided, by thine own rejected
O most afflicted

For me, kind Jesus, was thine incarnation
Thy mortal sorrow, and thy life's oblation
Thy death of anguish and thy bitter passion
For my salvation

// I Am Santa's Helper //

I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave

I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave

I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave

I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave
I am Santa's helper, you are Santa's slave

// Do You Hear What I Hear? //

Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see?

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song
High above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know?
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know?
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Do you feel what I feel now?

// Christmas In The Room //

No travel plans, no shopping malls
No candy canes, no Santa Claus
For as the day of rest draws near
It's just the two of us this year

No silver bells or mistletoe
We'll kiss and watch our TV shows

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
'Til it's Christmas in the room

No traffic jams, no ice and storm
Far in the house the fire is warm
No Christmas tree, no great parade
It's just an ordinary day

No parties planned, no place to go
It's just the two of us alone
And in the house we see a light
That comes from what we feel inside

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
'Til it's Christmas in the room
'Til it's Christmas in the room

Oh, I can see the day when we'll die
But I don't care to think of silence
For now I hear you laughing
The greatest joy is like the sunrise

No gifts to give, they're all right here
Inside our hearts, the glorious cheer
And in the house we see a light
That comes from what we know inside

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
'Til it's Christmas in the room

I'll come to you, I'll sing to you
Like it's Christmas in the room
I'll dance with you, I'll laugh with you
Like it's Christmas in the room
Like it's Christmas in the room

// Good King Wenceslas //

La la, hey! It's Christmas...

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

Hey! It's Christmas...
Hey! It's Christmas...

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gath'ring winter fuel

Hey!

Hey! Alphabet street...

// Alphabet St. //

I'm going down to Alphabet street
I'm gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy
She'll want me from my head to my feet
(Yeah, she will)

I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
A white rad ride, '66 ('67) so glam it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the back seat
And drive her to Tennessee

Excuse me, baby
I don't mean to be rude
I guess tonight I'm just not, just not in the mood
So if you don't mind, I would like to watch, can I?

I'm going down, down, down if that's the only way
To make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got to say
Put the right letters together and make a better day
Baby it's the only way

// The Child With The Star On His Head //

Positive Christmas energy, desperately seeking Santa, Take 3

Once in a while, you may think you see better than the others
Scrambling around in the dark with your drum
There is a time when young men must grow up and be brothers
Are you afraid of growing too fast?

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast
Blessed is she among women

And the trust we put in things
In small ideas, in engineering
The world of sports and second best
In consequences we will not put to rest

Why crawl around in the snow
When you know I am right here
Waiting for you to expect something more?

For I am warm, I am calling you close to my table
Where I have made us a feast 
For the year of troubles, they have gone
The winter brings a Christmas song

And the child with the star on his head
All of the world rests on his shoulders
And the mother with the child on her breast 
Blessed is she among women

Does all the world know better than
When Christmas comes the troubles end
The troubles end, the troubles end

And by the time there's nothing left
An empty tree, a winter vest
A winter vest, a winter vest

And all the trust we put in things
In dictionaries, in engineering
In calendars, and television
In father's friends, in consequences

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the lovelight gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

// Santa Claus Is Coming To Town //

You better watch out
You better not cry 
You better not pout 
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!
Santa Claus is coming to town!

Watch what you're doing
Always improving
He keeps his eyes on the prize of your spirit

He's in the window
Gathering info
He keeps his eyes on the prize of your personal

// The Sleigh In The Moon //

We wait in our beds
Tight under the sheets
Just peeking our heads
We've waited for weeks
I can't go to sleep
I tried counting sheep
It's coming so soon
The sleigh in moon

I'm holding my breath
I can't keep it yet
No, we won't forget
We know that we're blessed
We know that we're blessed
We know that we're blessed

// Sleigh Ride //

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

// Ave Maria //

Ave Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Maria, gratia plena
Ave, ave dominus
Dominus tecum
Benedictus tu in mulieribus
Et benedictus
Benedictus, dictus, dictus, fructus, ave fructus, ave dominus
Ave Maria

// X-Mas Spirit Catcher //

The angel came and said its name
But she could not keep from trembling
The spirit went where it went
Though it could not cede forgiveness

And when it came to pass again
Enterprising in its legend
The government did all it could
To be sure its power was given

To see yourself
What have you done with yourself?
Have you missed it?
To be of life, in living it
Love in fullness, life worth living

To understand the Son of Man
For the vision is the ending
In Israel, of sacrifice
Indignation is the mending

Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness
Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness

And Gabriel, in spite of it
Went for wandering in the desert
The Holy One is born of it
Mary and her cousin ever

Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness
Blessed is the woman
For to be called fullness

// Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! //

Oh the weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
And the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still good-bying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

// A Holly Jolly Christmas //

La la la, la la, la la

Have a holly jolly Christmas
It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer

Have a holly jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Ho ho the mistletoe
Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me

Have a holly jolly Christmas 
And in case you didn't hear 
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas 
This year

// Christmas Face //

Though I try to find my own way
To make your Christmas face, your Christmas face
Your holly hair and tinsel eyes
My efforts will disgrace

And at this hour a reason to stay up
Making your Christmas face, your Christmas face
To catch the snow that we should know
Falls perfectly in place

// Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas //

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on
Our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on
Our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years 
We all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

// Up On The Housetop //

Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

First comes the stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that can open and shut its eyes
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Next comes the stocking of little Will
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
Whistle, and ball, and a set of jacks
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Anyone particular, everyone fed
I'm in the doorstop holding it down
Waiting for a miracle, waiting for a crowd

One of the scenario, thinking up a cause
Anyone particular, any old cause
Hands on the counter, feet on the floor
Moving to the kitchen and you get your passport

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Down through the chimney is what the man said

Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Down through the chimney is what the man said

// We Need A Little Christmas //

1, 2, 3, 4
Haul out the holly
Put up the tree before my spirit falls again
Fill up the stocking
I may be rushing things, but deck the halls again now

For we need a little Christmas, right this very minute
Candles in the window, carols at the spinet
Yes, we need a little Christmas, right this very minute
It hasn't snowed a single flurry, Santa dear, we're in a hurry

So climb down the chimney
Turn on the brightest string of lights I've ever seen
Slice up the fruitcake
It's time we hung some tinsel on that evergreen bough

For I've grown a little leaner, grown a little colder
Grown a little sadder, grown a little older
And I need a little angel sitting on my shoulder
Need a little Christmas now

For we need a little music, need a little laughter
Need a little singing ringing through the rafter
And we need a little snappy happy ever after
Need a little Christmas now

// Happy Karma Christmas //

Would it have been best to forget you
Would it have been better for me
And if I could write off your intentions
Would you pretend you don't love me

And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
My karma girl

Sometimes I think I'm just a phantom
Loneliness grows deep within me
I gave you love, I gave you fortune
Still you insist you don't love me

And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
And I wish you a happy karma Christmas
And I miss you my happy karma girl
My karma girl

// Justice Delivers Its Death //

Silver and gold, silver and gold
Everyone wishes for it
How do you measure its worth?
Just by the pleasure it gives here on earth.

Oh, I'm getting old
Oh, I'm getting old
Everyone wishes for youth 
How have I wasted my life? 
Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth

Lord, come with fire
Lord, come with fire
Everyone's wasting their time 
Storing up treasure in vain
Trusting the pleasure it gives here on earth

Oh, I see the end
Oh, I see the end
Everyone's waiting for death 
How do you measure its worth?
Justice delivers its gift here on earth

Silver and gold, silver and gold
Silver and gold, silver and gold

// Christmas Unicorn //

I'm a Christmas Unicorn, in a uniform made of gold
With a billy-goat beard, and a sorcerer's shield, and mistletoe on my nose

Oh, I'm a Christian holiday, I'm a symbol of original sin
I've a pagan tree, and a magical wreath, and bow-tie on my chin

Oh, I'm a pagan heresy, I'm a tragic-al Catholic shrine
I'm a little bit shy, with a lazy eye, and a penchant for sublime

Oh, I'm a mystical apostasy, I'm a horse with a fantasy twist
Though I play all night, with my magical kite, people say I don't exist

For I make no full apology for the category I reside
I'm a mythical mess, with a treasury chest, I'm a construct of your mind

Oh, I'm hysterically American, I've a credit card on my wrist
And I have no home, or a field to roam, I will curse you with my kiss

Oh, I'm a criminal pathology with a history of medical care
I'm a frantic shopper, and a brave pill popper, and they say my kind are rare

But I've seen others in the uniform of a unicorn just like me
We are legions wide, and we choose no sides, we are masters of mystique

For you're a Christmas Unicorn, I have seen you on the beat
You may dress in the human uniform, child... But I know you're just like me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

I'm the Christmas Unicorn
You're the Christmas Unicorn too

I'm the Christmas Unicorn
(Find the Christmas Unicorn)
You're the Christmas Unicorn too
(It's all right, I love you)

Love, love will tear us apart, again
Love, love will tear us apart, my friend
