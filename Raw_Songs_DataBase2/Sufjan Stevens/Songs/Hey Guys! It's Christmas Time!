We can walk out after dark,
Because it's Christmas time
Colored lights glow from the park,
Because it's Christmas time.
And the bells on the reindeer sled say, 
It's Christmas time
And the quilt on the back of the bed say,
It's Christmas time

I think about how we could run away,
Now that it's Christmas time
We travel in a one horse open sleigh, 
Now that it's Christmas time

There's your father with his pipe,
He says it's Christmas time
He might let us stay up all night,
Because it's Christmas time
I might wish you all the best 
Because it's Christmas time
I might kiss you on the back of your neck 
Because it's Christmas time

I think about how we could run away, 
Now that it's Christmas time
We travel in a one horse open sleigh, 
Now that it's Christmas time

It's Christmas time
