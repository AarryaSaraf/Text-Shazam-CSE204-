Such a shame that I can't get over this
Put the axle on and roll again

Such a Saturn eye will close again
Watching every ring turning again

And I close my eyes
To everything you've rearranged
And I close my mind
To everything you've kept the same
Put the axle on and roll again

Cannot keep you in my bed again
Wake up every time, leave your space again

When the hairline breaks and lends you in
To the woman you've turned red again
