We were, we were 
We were lovers
We had no one
But armed puppets

We were touching
We were turning
We were eighteen
Get to learning

Saw your mother 
At the river washing ribbons
Saw her sip, saw her sip the East River

I've seen laid men up and walking
I've seen deaf and dead men talking

And I have had enough of trouble
I've been paid in full and double

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're able

I went dancing with my sister
Call her madam, call me mister

She wore a dress
It was nice and something
Underneath her dress was slipping

She did curse it, she did keep it
She said she did something stupid

I said: who's the master, Mira?
I can't kill or catch a fly dead

Point me in the right direction
Point me to the middle section

And I have had enough of trouble
I've been paid in full and double

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're able

Barricade glass against the table
Break it farmers if you're, if you're, if you're able
