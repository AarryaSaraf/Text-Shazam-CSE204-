My father, working nights
First shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam labor
Outside, in the parking lot
The current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By jove and by surprise
The current of lightning filled with light
It burned his hands with symbols
White noise as Lucifer
The sacred fire, the sacred fern
Conceived with holy water

His radiance in the dark
Mysterious shape or beauty mark
As if it were Minerva
Breastplate of Jupiter
The hovering deep, he spoke the word
The light, the virgin creature
All dreams and all disease are fantasy features, ill-conceived
Illusions worth remembering

My father, late at night
Forbidding death, he kissed the light
As Jupiter transfigured

I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me
By jove
I need you, sensation, my virtue, persuasion
By jove

Father of light
Father of death
Give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Summoner says that Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Red right eye
Put in its place
Under your foot, carpenter's cape
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Floundering star
Failed that you are
Fevering pitch
Figure of speech
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet

Say it with faith
Say it with force
Say it to my face
Put me in place
Sermon of death says Lucifer is the only conquest
Hurricane heart, hurricane haste
Wandering star, pick up your pace
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the only contest
Father of light
Father of death
Give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
