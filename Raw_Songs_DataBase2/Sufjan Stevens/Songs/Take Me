Love
Take me to your room
I want to be your friend


Will you walk me home at night?
Will you send me showers of light?
I want to be your friend

Will you kiss me on the lips?
Will you fill my lunar eclipse?
I want to be your friend

Will you touch me in the car?
Will you say that I am your star?
I want to be your friend

Will you keep me safe from harm?
Will you hold me close in your arms?
I want to be your friend





And I have no appetite
And I can not sleep through the night
I want to be your friend

I've got pictures in my head
My own thought of you in my bed
I want to be your friend

With terror you may find
For I fear I'm losing my mind
I want to be your friend

And my heart is such a mess
And I feel that I am possessed
I want to be your friend
