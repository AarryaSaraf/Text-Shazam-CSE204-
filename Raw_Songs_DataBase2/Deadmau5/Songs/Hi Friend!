Are you receiving?
Can you feel me?

The information
That you're seeking
A sensation that is sneaking
Has you reaching
For the ceiling
Theres no fighting
The igniting
This reciting is inviting

All systems go out on the floor
This is what you came here for

Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!

Now your mind is open
Your thoughts are flying
To the bounce thats amplifying
Taking form
As you're complying
Grab the notion
Carry on replying
Adopt tension
Embrace mention
True ascension
Feeds retention

All systems go out on the floor
This is what you came here for

Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend! Hi friend!
