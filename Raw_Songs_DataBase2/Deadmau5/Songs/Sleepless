In the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still and tight
Maybe we shouldn't fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shine

In the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still and tight
Maybe we shouldn't fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shine
