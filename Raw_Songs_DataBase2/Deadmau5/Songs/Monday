Nobody's wrong, nobody's right
Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Nobody cares, nobody minds
Night turns to day
And then the sun shines
and the sun shines
and the sun shines...

Nobody's wrong nobody's right
Everyone cheats everyone lies
Nobody cares nobody minds
Night turns to day
And then the sun shines
and the sun shines
and the sun sines
and the sun shines...
