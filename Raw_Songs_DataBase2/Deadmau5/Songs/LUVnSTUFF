It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
You take me to a place where my senses gave way
Turn it round, shut it down, what the people say
Climbing up, coming down, gonna make a call
Take my hand and leave it all, leave it all, leave it all

And then these arts torn apart when they turned black and blue
'Cause everybody knows I've been waiting for you

Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
Oh I wanna fall in love
With you
