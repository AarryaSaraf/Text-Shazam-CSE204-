Breathe it in now, then breathe it out
Let the air flow over me
Up high, can you tell me what you see?
This life, is it more than just a dream?
Look at me now, then look away
Can you tell me what to do?
Your eyes, they no longer speak for you
Inside, tell me where you hide the truth

Inside, tell me where you hide the truth

If you want me to stay
I need you to know
You can never, ever leave me alone
If you want me to stay
I need you to know
I can't
I can never let you go

I can never let you go
