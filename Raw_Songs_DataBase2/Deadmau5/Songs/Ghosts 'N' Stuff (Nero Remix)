It's been so long I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true 
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true 
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true 


But I just want to play it right
We are gonna get there tonight

It's been so long I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true 
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
