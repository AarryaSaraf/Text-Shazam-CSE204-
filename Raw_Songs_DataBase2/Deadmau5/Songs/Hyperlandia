We're only here for a day so don't tell me your name
And just melt into my arms while we disappear
In the darkness
Fast lives and high crime
I'm only here for a night, pass the neon lights
Yeah, I've traveled too far to go back to the place
That I started

Fast lives and high crime
I'm only here for a night, pass the neon lights
Yeah, I've traveled too far to go back to the place
