I know you'll look the other way
I-I-I-I, know you long for something new
So there you're wasting all your day
looking for something that was right in front of you
And I-I-I-I, just want them to notice you
And I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you

There's something flying in the air
And I-I-I-I, just don't know what it could be
Smoke is flying everywhere
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me
And I-I-I-I, I know that we might be through
But I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you.

I know you'll look the other way

And I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you

And I-I-I-I, I know that we might be through
But I-I-I-I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you.
