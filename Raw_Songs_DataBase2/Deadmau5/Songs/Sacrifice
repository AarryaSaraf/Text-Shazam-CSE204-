Do I love what I do
Even more than I love you? I might
When you're sick and hurting
And when you're celebrating your night
I'm an ocean away
I'm a time zone and two plane flights
Do I love what I do
Even more than I love you? I might

Will you sacrifice for me
If I don't sacrifice for you?
I won't be the one to let you go
But I'm not giving you anything to hold on to
I miss you and I'm sorry
You've become my number two
But will you sacrifice for me
If I won't sacrifice for you?

La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la

Stick it out with me
I'm not leaving you behind
I know you're busy
I know you also have a life
It's a pity that I don't like your city
And you don't like mine
Stick it out with me
I'm not leaving you behind

Will you sacrifice for me
If I don't sacrifice for you?
I won't be the one to let you go
But I'm not giving you anything to hold on to
I miss you and I'm sorry
You've become my number two
But will you sacrifice for me
If I won't sacrifice for you?

La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la
La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la
