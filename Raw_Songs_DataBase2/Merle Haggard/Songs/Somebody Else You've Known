I've always been the kinda guy that didn't love a lot
I took all the love they offered me with ease
And it didn't make much difference if they loved me or not
Cause I'd love 'em for a while then I'd leave
Yeah I can't believe it's really me hurtin' like I do
Just because you left me all alone
I've seen it happen many times to other guys you knew
Surely I must be somebody else you've known
Well when I first met you darling you impressed me more than some
I should have took the warning way back then
But I never stopped to think it that even my day had to come
And like the other guys I want you back again
Yeah I can't believe it's really me...
Surely I must be somebody else you've known
