So much for me, so much for you

Oh, how hard we fought today behind that courtroom door
Deviding up the things we both had worked together for
Now we go our seperate ways, the ties no longer bind
So much will belong to you and so much will be mine

It's over now, the paper's signed
What once was ours is yours or mine
But don't forget to divide the heartaches too
So much for me, so much for you

We signed our names and thanked the judge and walked out in the hall
Too confused to realize the reason for it all
We should have fought as hard to make our love grow fine and strong
As we have fought to prove which one of us was right or wrong

It's over now, the paper's signed
What once was ours is yours or mine
But don't forget to divide the heartaches too
So much for me, so much for you
