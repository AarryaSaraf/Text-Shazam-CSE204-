Slowly but surely I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you
Slowly but surely you're winning my heart
And you're winning my heart too

Slowly but surely I'm losing my heart
And I'm losing my heart to you
Slowly but surely my dreams will come true
If I spend my lifetime with you

You're just what I wanted
You're just what I needed
You're my every dream come true
My life's growing stronger
I can't wait much longer
I'm falling in love with you

Slowly but surely I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you
Slowly but surely my dreams will come true
If I spend my lifetime with you

You're just what I wanted
You're just what I needed
You're my every dream come true
My life's growing stronger
I can't wait much longer
I'm falling in love with you
Yes, I'm falling in love with you
