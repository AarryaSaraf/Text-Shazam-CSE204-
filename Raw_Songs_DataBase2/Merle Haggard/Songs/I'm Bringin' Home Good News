Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news
Got some things you'll be glad to hear
Like I'm leavin' town and won't be back around
Just long enough to get my gear.

There won't be any goodbye kisses
Well, I'm puttin' on my leavin' shoes
This is the end we're through it's over
Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news.

Well, I was sittin' downtown in a tavern
And I made up my mind to go
And I knew you would be so glad to be free
I just thought to call you to let you know.

Oh, you can tell all your backdoor daddys
That your big daddy's done blew a fuse
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah, I'm bringin' home some good news.

To you I been known as bad news
Well, I'm changin' my first name
And I'm givin' you your freedom baby
That old race won't kinda change.

Yeah, go to hide your lookman slippers
I won't be lookin' around for blues
This is the end, we're through, it's over
Yeah I'm bringin' home some good news.

Good news, there's some good news for you honey
I'm bringin' home some good news
I'm bringin' home some good news honey...
