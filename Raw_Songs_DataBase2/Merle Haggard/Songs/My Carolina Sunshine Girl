Moon, moon, I can see you sinking low
You make me think of sweetheart a little girl that I love so
After I wonder the whole night through wondering if you miss me too
Oh, why I'm about lonesome thinking of someone thinking only of you.

My carolina sunshine girl
You have turned my heart to stone
My Carolina sunshine girl
You have left me all alone.

I wonder why I sit and cry
When I really should laugh at your little old photograph
Well, you're the sweetest thing here in this world
And I love, love, love you my Carolina sunshine girl.

I wonder why I sit and cry
When I really should laugh at your little old photograph
Well, you're the sweetest thing here in this world
And I love, love, love you my Carolina sunshine girl...
