Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you

Some other's arms may hold and caress you
Some other's lips may burn on my own
That's why your eyes are filled with their beauty
My heart inside will be crying alone

Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you

When you find a true love you treasure
Other affairs are just to pass time
You'll find their love just a cheap imitation
The love they offer's not real genuine

Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you
Too used to being with you
