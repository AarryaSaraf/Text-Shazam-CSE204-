I just wanna look at you one more time
I'll always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time.

If I can't do you right I'll never do you wrong
That's why I think it's best for me to move along
I won't ever be myself unless I'm free to roam
Give me one last moment here and I'll be gone.

I just wanna look at you one more time
I'll always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time.

I just wanna look at you one more time
I'll always like to know how much I leave behind
Let this be the picture that I'll always have in mind
I just wanna look at you one more time...
