Well I gotta keep my reputation I gotta keep my pride
Can't let you know you've hurt me I can't let you know I've cried
I gotta make you think I'm happy everywhere I go
I gotta keep my hurt inside me I can't let it show
I gotta drink up and be somebody I have another round
I can't let my troubles find me I gotta keep your mem'ry down
Can't let you drive me crazy can't let you win I gotta drink up and be somebody again

Well I can't spend my whole life grieving I gotta find myself
I gotta put me back together I gotta find me someone else
I don't make you think I'm happy everywhere I go
I gotta keep my hurt inside me I can't let it show
I gotta drink up and be somebody...
