Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

"Don't leave me," I cry
Don't take that airplane ride
Hey, but you locked me out of your mind
And left me standing here behind

Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight

"Don't leave me," I cry
Don't take that airplane ride
You locked me out of your mind
And left me standing close behind

Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring engines headed somewhere in flight
They're taking you away, leaving me lonely
Silver wings slowly fading out of sight
Slowly fading out of sight
Slowly fading out of sight
