I love the women I love 'em all the same
I love the women I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody well enough to change her name
The women make a fool out of me.

Hey my papa scolded me my mama she sat and cried
Yeah oh my papa scolded me my mama she sat and cried
I got too many women for any little boy my size
Yeah the women make a fool out of me.

When I'm in the parlor the girls think it's a treat
Yeah when I'm in the parlor the girls think it's a treat
Cause even in the winter time they turn off the heat hey
Women make a fool out of me.

Yeah I love the women Lord I love 'em all the same
I love the women I love 'em all the same
But I don't love nobody well enough to change her name
Here we go
The women make a fool out of me...
