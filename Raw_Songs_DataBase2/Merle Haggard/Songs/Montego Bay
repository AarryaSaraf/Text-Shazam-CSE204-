I showed her most of Tennessee that's all I could afford
I even thought of stealing so I could show her more
But she never did seem happy and I often heard her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Oh, I should have gone with her at least I wouldn't know
What about Montego Bay that makes it pull so strong
All I've got's old mem'ries of the way she used to say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Why couldn't I convince her, why couldn't I make her see
There's no way Montego Bay needs her more than me
When she left she seemed so happy I can still hear her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Why couldn't I convince her, why couldn't I make her see
There's no way Montego Bay needs her more than me
When she left she seemed so happy I can still hear her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay...
