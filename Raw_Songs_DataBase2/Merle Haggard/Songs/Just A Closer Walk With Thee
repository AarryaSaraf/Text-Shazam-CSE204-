I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long
As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me will be no more
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy Kingdom's shore, to Thy shore

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be
