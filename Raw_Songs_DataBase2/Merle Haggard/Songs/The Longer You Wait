The longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
And the longer it takes you to break my heart the longer the pain lingers on
How long will you prolong my misery wish I could leave on my own
Cause the longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
We both know that you never loved me I lied to myself from the start
We both know that someday you'll leave me and the knowin' just tears me apart
How long will you prolong my misery...
The longer I'll hurt when you're gone
