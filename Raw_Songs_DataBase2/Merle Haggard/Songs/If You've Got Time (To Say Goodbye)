If you've got time to say goodbye
Have mercy on a guy that's gonna miss you
I know you're in a hurry
But consider all the hurt I'm going through

Let me brace my heart so I can face the part
That I've been dreading for so long

If you've got time to say goodbye
Then I promise I won't cry till you're gone

I know a man should never show his feelings
And I should pretend I'm glad you're leaving

If you've got time to say goodbye
Have mercy on a guy that's gonna miss you
I know you're in a hurry
But consider all the hurt I'm going through

Let me brace my heart so I can face the part
That I've been dreading for so long

If you've got time to say goodbye
Then I promise I won't cry till you're gone
