Far to sense you'd up and leave that's what you say
Don't you know that the road can run both ways
Well, I'm so sure before each other we're all wrong
And I'm tired of always trying to get along

Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free

I'm all through with trying to make the gold of us
And I've given up on giving in so much
As far as I'm concerned it's over but to pack
I could walk away and never once look back

Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free
