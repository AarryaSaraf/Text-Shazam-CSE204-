It may be down the south in Alabama
Or maybe just a little old one horse town
It could be on the back streets of Chicago
But if it's home it's still the greatest place around.

Home's where a kid grows up'
And spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be
No matter how far away.

There may be an old sweetheart still there waitin'
Can't tell I might even find a few old friends
I know my mom and dad would like to see me
And know I want so much to go back home again.

Home's where the kid grows up
And spends his younger days
Home is where I long to be
No matter how far away.

It may be down the south in Alabama...
