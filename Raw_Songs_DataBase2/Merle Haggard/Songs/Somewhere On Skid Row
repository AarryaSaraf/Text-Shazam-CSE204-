I'm gonna lose myself somewhere on skid row
Since I lost you I just don't seem to care
I'm gonna lose myself somewhere on Skid Row
So the wine won't let your mem'ry find me there.

Well, I've been everywhere running both day and night
With the pain of loving you right close behind
And I've tried everything and whether I'm wrong or right
There's just one way I found to ease my mind.

And I'm gonna lose myself somewhere on skid row
Since I lost you I just don't seem to care
I'm gonna lose myself somewhere on Skid Row
So the wine won't let your mem'ry find me there...
