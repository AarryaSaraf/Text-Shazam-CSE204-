As you travel along on the Jericho Road
Does the world seem all wrong and heavy your load
Just bring it to Christ, your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart will be blessed

On the Jericho Road there's room for just two
No more and no less just Jesus and you
Each burden He'll bear, each sorrow He'll share
There's never a care for Jesus is there

Oh, brother to you this message I bring
Though hope may be gone He'll cause you to sing
At Jesus' command sins shackles must fall
On the Jericho Road will you answer His call

On the Jericho Road there's room for just two
No more and no less just Jesus and you
Each burden He'll bear, each sorrow He'll share
There's never a care for Jesus is there
On the Jericho Road
