The girl I love so much just walked in the door
My past is present but she's not mine anymore
Did she stop by to hurt me or does she even know I'm here
My past is present it'd be that she still cares.

For without her there's no future she's close yet far away
I keep hoping that my tomorrows will catch up with yesterday
For time has stopped my world has stopped since she went away
My past is present I just hope she's back to stay.

For time has stopped my world has stopped since she went away
My past is present I just hope she's back to stay...
