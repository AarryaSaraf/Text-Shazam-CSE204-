She came her to see me today in prison where I have to stay
But this time she came here to tell me goodbye
Pretending that I understood I held back the tears best I could
But I know that she knew I wanted to cry.

'Cause my hands're tied
I'm locked here inside
I want her, I need her, I love her
But my hands're tied.

Her visits kept my world alive our love found the way to survive
But now it's all over I've lost her for good
She waited with arms open wide till somebody else stepped inside
But I know she waited as long as she could.

'Cause my hands're tied
I'm locked here inside
I want her, I need her, I love her
But my hands're tied...
