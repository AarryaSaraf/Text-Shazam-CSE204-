I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
The way that you did, when I was a kid
When I'd come home with mud on my feet

The captain just gave us our orders
And mom we must carry them through
And I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you

Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed, for there was no name
And she knew that her soldier had died

Then the mother knelt down by her bedside
And she prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons who are fighting tonight
And, Dear God, keep America free

I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
