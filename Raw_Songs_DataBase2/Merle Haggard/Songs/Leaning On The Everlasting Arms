What a fellowship
What a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms
What a blessedness
What a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Safe and secure
From all alarms
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Oh how sweet to walk
In this pilgrim way
Leaning on the everlasting arms
Oh how bright the path
Grows from day to day
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Safe and secure
From all alarms
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning on the everlasting arms

What have I to dread
What have I to fear
Leaning on the everlasting arms
I have blessed peace
With my lord so near
Leaning on the everlasting arms

Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Safe and secure
From all alarms
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning (on Jesus)
Leaning on the everlasting arms
