There'll always be a few of us to keep the barrooms busy
And there'll always be fools like me with no place else to turn
'Cause liquor has the charmin' taste to keep you coming back
For it's true I guess that some of us never learn.

A crowded bar can't ever change the past
But from time to time we drown it in a glass
'Cause liquor has the charmin' taste to keep you coming back
Well, it's true I guess that some of us never learn.

Never learn...
