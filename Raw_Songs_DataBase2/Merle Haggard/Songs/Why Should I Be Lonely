Oh, the moon lights so bright makes me lonely tonight
Everything seems to make me feel blue here
I'm down hearted now I'm lonesome somehow
'Cause you are proving untrue.

But why should I be so lonely
Why should I be so sad
Though another is taking from me
The best pal that I ever had.

She's taking the sunshine with her
And leaving the clouds for me
But why should I be so lonesome
When there's nobody lonesome for me.

The violets so blue are calling for you
The roses so sweet make me lonely
They bring to my mind a sweet happy time
When your love was only for me.

But why should I be so lonely
Why should I be so sad
Though another is taking from me
The best pal that I ever had.

She's taking the sunshine with her
And leaving the clouds for me
But why should I be so lonesome
When there's nobody lonesome for me...
