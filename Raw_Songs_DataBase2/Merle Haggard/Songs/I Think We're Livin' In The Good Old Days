I think we're livin' in the good old days
So cheer up friends and be glad
I think we're livin' in the good old days
The best anybody's ever had.

We think we're doin' now maybe day or less later
So let's live it up all the way
And let's make the life one more night to remember
Tomorrow we'll look back on today.

I think we're livin' in the good old days
So cheer up friends and be glad
I think we're livin' in the good old days
The best anybody's ever had.

Well, when I hear people talkin' bout the good old days
That's one thing I can't understand
Well while I take advantage of today and tomorrow
And let's live it up while we can.

I think we're livin' in the good old days
So cheer up friends and be glad
I think we're livin' in the good old days
The best anybody's ever had...
