Every fool has rainbow
But he never seems to find
The reward that should be waiting
At the end of the line.

But he'll give up a bed of roses for
A life filled with thorns
And go chasing after rainbows
Everytime the dream is born.

And every fool has a rainbow
That only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow
And the rule replies to me.

And every fool has a rainbow
That only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow
And the rule replies to me...
