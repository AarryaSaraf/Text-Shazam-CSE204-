Sing me a song of sadness 
And sing it as blue as I feel
If a tear should appear it's because she's not here 
Sing a sad song and sing it for me

She's unhappy with me she told me so 
I'm unhappy without her 
And I still love her so
Oh sing me a song of sadness 
Pretend it's the end of the world
Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me

Sing it sweet and sing it low 
And then I'll have to go sing a sad song
And sing it for me
