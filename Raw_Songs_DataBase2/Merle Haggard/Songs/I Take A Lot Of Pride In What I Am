Things I learned in a hobo jungle
Were things they never taught me in a classroom,
Like where to find a handout
While thumbin' through Chicago in the afternoon.
Hey, I'm not braggin' or complainin',
Just talkin' to myself man to man.
This ole' mental fat I'm chewin' didn't take alot of doin'.
But I take alot of pride in what I am.

I guess I grew up a loner, 
I don't remember ever havin' any folks around.
But I keep thumbin' through the phone books,
And lookin' for my daddy's name in every town.
And I meet lots of friendly people, 
That I always end up leavin' on the lam.
Where I've been or where I'm goin' 
Didn't take alot of knowin',
But I take alot of pride in what I am.

I never travel in a hurry, 
'Cause I got nobody waitin' for me anywhere.
Home is anywhere I'm livin',
If it's sleepin' on some vacant bench in City Square,
Or if I'm workin' on some road gang, 
Or just livin' off the fat of our great land.
I never been nobody's idol, But at least I got a title,
And I take alot of pride in what I am.

I never been nobody's idol, But at least I got a title,
And I take alot of pride in what I am.

I take alot of pride in what I am.

I take alot of pride in what I am...
