Yeah I'm a shade tree fix-it man I don't need any helping hand
I'm a Jack-of-all-trades when I'm workin' in their shade
I'm a shade tree-fix-it man
Well I headed outa west from Arkansas my Ruby ran fine for a while
Then a rock started knockin' a guage started rockin' she wouldn't run another mile
But on that downhill drag I coasted for awhile till I found me a shady inn
I started huffin' and a puffin' started a frettin' and a sweatin'
But I soon had her runnin' again
Cause I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
Bout noon the next day I was back on the road I had her runnin' on out
While I was wheelin' and a dealin' I got a funny feelin'
If my baby kinda felt this doubt
Oh I found me a shade by the side of the road I fixed everything up fine
With a little bit of lovin' in a few minutes later we was rolling on down the line
Cause I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
One more time I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
Yeah I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
