We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands

It's lonely just to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing when I'll ever get to hold you tight
Oh yes, I have temptations and sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love

'Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
'Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands

Today a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter that said you love me so
And there I found the strenght to tell him no

'Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
'Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
And come what may our hearts are holding hands
