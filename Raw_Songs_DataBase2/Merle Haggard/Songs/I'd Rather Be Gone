I feel like a stranger in this home I built for you
And I can't understand this awful change you're going through
But lately, I've been watching you grow colder every day
And I'd rather be gone, than in your way

I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather see someone else here, in my place
And if I decide on leaving, my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone, than in your way

I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather see someone else here, in my place
And if I decide on leaving, my world will end today
But I'd rather be gone, than in your way
I'd rather be gone
