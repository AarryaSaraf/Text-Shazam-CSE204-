If the one you'd think is true ever turns his back on you
You've still got a place in my heart
If every road you take proves you've made a big mistake
Baby you've still got a place in my heart.

If I'm a fool to pray that you'll come back some day
Well then I'll know of million fools that love has turned that way
If the years should make you cry don't go on and live a lie
Baby you've still got a place in my heart.

If the years should make you cry don't go on and live a lie
Baby you've still got a place in my heart...
