(Johnny take your banjo there I'm gonna try to do Tommy Duncan's part
And Eldon and Tiny and Roy you can make a whole thing called Misery
Two three four.)

Went to bed last night wasn't sleeping
Wondering what's happening to me
You took my heart and left me lonely
Now I've got nothing left but misery.

Wondering if you have found another
Love brings no consolation to my heart
Some of these days you'll be sorry
That you fill my heart with misery.

Some of these days you'll be sorry
That you fill my heart with misery misery...
