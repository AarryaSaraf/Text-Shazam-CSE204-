There's a long line of mourners coming down our street
Their fancy cars're such a sight to see
They're all of your rich friends that knew you in the city
And now they finally brought you back to me.

The papers told of how you lost your life
Of the party and that fatal crash that night
The race on the highway the curve nobody seen
Now you're riding in that long black limousine.

When you left home you told me that someday you'd be returnin'
With a fancy car for a whole town to see
Well now everybody's watching now and I guess you finally got your dream
You're riding in one of them long black limousines.

Through tears I watch as you ride by
With a chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
I'll never love another for my heart and all my dreams
Ride with you in that long black limousine...
