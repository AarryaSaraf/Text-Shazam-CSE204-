Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness

But wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost, dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in
A few more days to get our loved ones in
