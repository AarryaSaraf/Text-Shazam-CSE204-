Now when the big bad wolf got in grandma's house
A little Red Ridinghood was scared as the mouse
And just like her I'm scared through and through
Some two legged wolf would run away with you.

So run 'em off no use to talk all day
Just run 'em off they're tryin' to get you to play
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.

Now there's an iceman and milkman and folks out of town
They don't come to visit they just hang around
They act just as friendly as can be
But I don't think they care a thing about me.

So run 'em off don't talk too long
Run 'em off so we can be alone
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.

No matter where you are or what you do
Folks start to whistle and how is you
When they get too close I wanna say shoo
Cause it looks like they wanna take what bother you.

So run 'em off, don't talk too long
You're gonna get in Dutch
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me.

Now once I ended this song but I write so more
Cause there's a half-a-dozen wolfs comin' up to my door
And I can tell by a lookin' cause it's plain to see
That they're not here to make eyes at me.

So run 'em off don't talk too long
You're gonna get in Dutch
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off I swear you're cheatin' on me...
