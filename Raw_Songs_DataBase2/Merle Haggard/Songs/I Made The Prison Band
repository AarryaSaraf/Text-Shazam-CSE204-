Deep inside this lonely prison where the pleasures are so few
Where the walls are strong and the days are long and there's nothin' new
I learned to play the guitar and I'm a doin' the best I can
I guess I could be worse because I made the prison band
I made the prison band.

Now there's ole bashful Bill on the doghouse bass Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Ponkatilla where they drive a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum there's two time Tom our mshot temple man
The boys call me their singin' MC since I made the prison band
I made the prison band.

I've been plannin' a break since Christmas I had the details all worked out
But now I know that I ain't gonna go and there's no doubt
I had my try-out Sunday and the outcome changed my plan
I gotta rehearse for the Friday night show cause I made the prison band
I made the prison band.

Now there's ole bashful Bill on the doghouse bass Willie on the steel guitar
He hails from Ponkatilla where they drive a pretty mean bar
And back on the drum there's two time Tom our mshot temple man
The boys call me their singin' MC since I made the prison band
I made the prison band.

I made the prison band...
