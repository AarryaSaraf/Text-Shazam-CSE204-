Today something told me not to call you
But with trembling hands I dialed the telephone
And as it rang the seventh time
I knew I'd lost what once was mine
There'll be no more you and me from now on
There'll be no more you and me there'll be only misery
Cause you and him me and loneliness but no more you and me
I don't have to see his arms wrapped around you
To know you've chosen him instead of me
But just to know you'd be with him I called the place you'd been
I had to verify the thing I couldn't see
There'll be no more you and me...
