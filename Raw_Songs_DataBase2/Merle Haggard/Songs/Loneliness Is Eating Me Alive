There hasn't been one bit of laughter in this house so long
Just the howlin' of the wind asking why
I know this house ain't growing but it seems bigger since you're gone
And the loneliness is eatin' me alive.

If there's any forgiveness in ye wrap it up and come on home
Yeah I may not change completely oh but I'll try
And honey you have to hurry or there'd be no reason to come home
Cause this loneliness is eatin' me alive.

The bigger the house the harder the tear falls I found it out since your goodbye
And honey you'll have to hurry or there'll be no reason to come home
Cause this loneliness is eatin' me alive yeah this loneliness is eatin' me alive.
