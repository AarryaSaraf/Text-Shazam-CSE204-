My brain is cloudy my soul is upside down
Lord my brain is cloudy my soul is upside down
When I get the slow down feelin' I know the blues must be someplace around
Well you gotta treat me right honey day by day.

Get out your little prayer book get upon your knees and pray
You're gonna need you're gonna need my love someday
And you're goin' to be sorry oh you treated me this way.

Well good evenin' don't that sun look good goin' down
I said well good evenin' don't that sun look good goin' down
And don't your home look lonesome when your lover ain't no place around
Well I tried everything baby to get along with you
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

I'm gonna stop my cryin' and leave you alone
You don't believe I need it you can't count the tears I'm gone
Cause you're gonna need you're gonna need my love someday
And Lord you're goin' to be sorry oh you treated me this way...
