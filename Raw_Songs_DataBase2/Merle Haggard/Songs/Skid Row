Well not long ago I was a happy man
Money in my pockets with the rings on my hands
My money's all Gone and I'm feelin' low 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row

My girl friend left me she don't want me no more
We had a great big fight just a night before
She said I got no class because she knows 
I've been hangin' around on Skid Row

Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row

I got an old John Beam with the pain more through
Got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
My wine's all gone and I need some more 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row

Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row
