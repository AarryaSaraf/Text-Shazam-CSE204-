I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good if I can't have your love
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's, they're worth less anyway
If I can't hold the one I'm dreamin' of

Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good without you anyhow

Just an empty world is all I have before me
I'd give anything if you were with me now
I'd trade all of my tomorrow's for just one yesterday
For my life's no good without you anyhow
