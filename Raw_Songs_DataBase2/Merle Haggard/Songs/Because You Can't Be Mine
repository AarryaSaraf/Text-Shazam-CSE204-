What makes something you can't have always look so good
Why'd do something out of reach seem so fine
What makes you thrill me more than any girl I know
I guess it's just because you can't be mine.

Why can't I be contented with what belongs to me
And be satisfied with what's already mine
What makes a stolen moment such a precious thing
I guess it's just because you can't be mine.

What makes me always want a woman I can't have
Why the someone else's silver always shine
My patience rises every time you come around
And I guess it's just because you can't be mine.

Why can't I be contented with what belongs to me
And be satisfied with what's already mine
What makes a stolen moment such a precious thing
I guess it's just because you can't be mine...
