I played the brand new record on the jukebox
And I scarcely could believe the song I've heard
It told of how you left me for another 
It was almost like I'd written every word

Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you've done me wrong 
Someone told my story in a song

The writer must've seen the way you done me
For he told it all and never missed a line
He told of swinging doors and the jukebox 
And he even knew I almost lost my mind

Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you've done me wrong 
Someone told my story in a song
