All around the water tanks
Waiting for a train
A thousand miles away from home
Sleeping in the rain.

I walked up to a brakeman
To give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money
I'll see that you don't walk.

I haven't got a nickel
Not a penny can I show
Get off, get off, you railroad bum
And he slammed that boxcar door.

He put me off in Texas
The place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me
The moon and stars up above.

Nobody seemed to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixie Land.

Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waitin' for a train.

Nobody seemed to want me
Nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco
I'm going back to Dixie Land.

Though my pocketbook is empty
And my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home
Waitin' for a train...
