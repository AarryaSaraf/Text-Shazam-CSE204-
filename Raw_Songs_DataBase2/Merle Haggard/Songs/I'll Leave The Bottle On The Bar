A loser doesn't always know he's losing
Till he's lost the game and it's too late to win
I hope I'll call in time and you'll forgive me
Cause I want so much to come back home again.

And I'll leave the bottle on the bar
If you'll take me back to start anew
I'll leave the bottle on the bar
I'll sober up and come back home to you.

I stood by and let the bottle come between us
And I let it through me time and time again
Before I thought the wine was all I needed
But now I see just what a fool I've been.

And I'll leave the bottle on the bar
If you'll take me back to start anew
I'll leave the bottle on the bar
I'll sober up and come back home to you...
