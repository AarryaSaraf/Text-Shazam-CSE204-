Admitting you're to blame won't heal my wounded pride
It's too late to be ashamed I've already stepped aside
Just let me live again and please don't come around
If you never loved me then you'll never love me now.

You fooled me all the way each time you held me tight
But when darkness turned to day then I finally saw the light
When I really needed you that's when you let me down
If you never loved me then you'll never love me now.

Just let me live again and please don't come around
If you never loved me then you'll never love me now...
