Jimmie Rodgers earned the title of America's blue yodler
By composing and performing a series of 12 blue yodles
Jimmie by no means invented the yodle
But provided the yodle a unique interpretation by combining it with the blues
Jimmie made the yodle work for him
His yodle could display pain loneliness or even a happy frame of mind
Somebody said that Jimmie often inserted the yodle because he ran out of
lyric but I prefer to think that Jimmie Rodger's yodle more often
Than not displayed his real feelings better than any lyric could have...
