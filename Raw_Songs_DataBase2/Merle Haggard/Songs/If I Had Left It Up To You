You made plans to leave a thousand times I know
And a thousand times I should have let you go
But each time I'll always beg you back somehow
If I'd left it up to you it'd all be over now

It'd all be over now cept the crying 
I'd be used to spending all my nights alone
Wish I'd found the way to let you go somehow
If I'd left it up to you it'd all be over now

It'd all be over now cept the crying 
I'd be used to spending all my nights alone
Wish I'd found the way to let you go somehow
If I'd left it up to you it'd all be over now
