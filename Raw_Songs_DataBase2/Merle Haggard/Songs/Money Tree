Silver and gold made you say goodbye
One day it may make you wanna cry
When you're alone with a heart that's blue
Who will you take your heartaches too.

Love can't grow on a money tree
Not the kind you had with me
Some day when you're older a wiser girl you'll be
Then you'll know that love can't grow on a money tree.

I don't blame you for all my pain
A young girl like you needs time to dream
You're happy now but how long will it last
One day you'll be just a girl with the past.

Love can't grow on a money tree
Not the kind you had with me
Some day when you're older a wiser girl you'll be
Then you'll know that love can't grow on a money tree...
