// Carolyn //

Carolyn let me tell you what I've heard about a man today
He didn't come home from work and he went away
Till he came to a city bright in the night time like day.

There they say he met up with some women dressed in yellow and scarlet
Their warm lips like a honeycomb dripped with honey
Somethin' about the smell of strange perfume made him feel warm and not alone.

Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own and sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe that man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always when he's treated bad at home.

Yes Carolyn, a man will do that sometimes on his own and sometimes when he's lonely
And I believe that man might do that sometimes out of spite
But Carolyn a man will do that always when he's treated bad at home...
