// Soldier's Last Letter //

I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat
The way that you did, when I was a kid
When I'd come home with mud on my feet

The captain just gave us our orders
And mom we must carry them through
And I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you

Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
And she fought against tears in her eyes
But they came unashamed, for there was no name
And she knew that her soldier had died

Then the mother knelt down by her bedside
And she prayed Lord above hear my plea
And protect all the sons who are fighting tonight
And, Dear God, keep America free

I'm writing this down in a trench mom
Don't scold if it isn't so neat

// Shelly's Winter Love //

I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again

When springtime comes I know that she'll be leavin'
When those friends of her's start callin' her uptown
So I live and wait for Shelly's winter season
When her troubled moments bring her back around

I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again

When Shelly's painted world turns cold and stormy
It's then she finds the need to come around
To these arms of mine she knows are always waiting
But she'll leave when love has thawed the winter ground

I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again

// Jesus, Take A Hold //

Like the ancient Roman Empire this world is doomed to fall 
And it's much too big a thing for mortal man 
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall 
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand 

This world has never been in the awful shape it's in 
And people scorn the things our leaders do 
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man 

Jesus take a hold and lead us through 

The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound 
And our city streets are filled with angry men 
Law's now a mockery throughout our troubled land 
And destruction seems to be the current trend 

This world has never been in the awful shape it's in 
And our leaders seem in doubt what to do 
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man 
Jesus take a hold and lead us through 
Jesus take a hold and lead us through

// I Can't Be Myself //

It's a way of mine to say just what I'm thinking
And to do the things I really want to do
And you want to change the part of me I'm proud of
So I can't be myself when I'm with you

Oh you never liked the clothes I wear on Sunday
Just because I don't believe the way you do
But I believe the Lord knows I'm unhappy 
Cause I can't be myself when I'm with you

I can't be myself and be what pleases you
And down deep inside I don't believe that you want me to
And it's not my way to take so long deciding 
That I can't be myself when I'm with you

// I'm A Good Loser //

Yeah I'm a good loser born to be that way this dog he never had his day
Yeah I'm a good loser so don't worry bout my pride
Me don't look back you can't see my hurt inside

There must be a sin I'm payin' for cause I felt my share of heartaches long before
This same life runs in cicles I can't say they're wrong
My lucks been running bad too long
But I'm a good loser...
[guitar]
There's no sign of changes coming soon and I may never sing another tune
Cause losin' you would probly be my biggest hurt today
But don't you let my feelin's make your way
Cause I'm a good loser...

// Sidewalks Of Chicago //

The Levis that I'm wearin' have beeen good to me
They just won't admit they're growin' old
Though my shirt's made contact with the gutter, now and then
At least it keeps my body from the cold

Thank God, folks back home in Harland County
Can't see what success has done to me
Would you believe the kids in Harland High School
Voted me most likely to succeed

Now I'm walkin' on the sidewalks of Chicago
If I buy the bread I can't afford the wine
Now I'm walkin' on the sidewalks of Chicago
Wishin' I had lived some other time

I wasn't here too long before I met her
And then later she really swept me off my feet
And she stayed just long enough to make me love her
And now they're sweepin' me up off the street

My mama thinks I've really hit the big time
She's written ever day since I've been gone
But she doesn't know that 109 West Charolette
Is the address of the West Side Mission Home

Now I'm walkin' on the sidewalks of Chicago
If I buy the bread I can't afford the wine
Now I'm walkin' on the sidewalks of Chicago
Wishin' I had lived some other time

// If You've Got Time (To Say Goodbye) //

If you've got time to say goodbye
Have mercy on a guy that's gonna miss you
I know you're in a hurry
But consider all the hurt I'm going through

Let me brace my heart so I can face the part
That I've been dreading for so long

If you've got time to say goodbye
Then I promise I won't cry till you're gone

I know a man should never show his feelings
And I should pretend I'm glad you're leaving

If you've got time to say goodbye
Have mercy on a guy that's gonna miss you
I know you're in a hurry
But consider all the hurt I'm going through

Let me brace my heart so I can face the part
That I've been dreading for so long

If you've got time to say goodbye
Then I promise I won't cry till you're gone

// The Farmer's Daughter //

Tonight there'll be candlelight and roses
In this little country chapel that's almost falling down
There'll be tears in this old farmer's eyes this evening
When I give my one possession to that city boy from town

His hair is a little longer than we're use to
But, I guess I should find something good to say
About this man who's won the farmer's daughter
And will soon become my son-in-law today

Mama left eight years ago December
And it was hard to be a Dad and Mama too
But, somehow we made home of this old farmhouse
And love was all my baby ever knew

He could be the richest man in seven counties
And not be good enough to take her hand
But, he says he really loves the farmer's daughter
And I know the farmer's daughter loves the man

// I've Done It All //

Did you ever steal a quarter when you was 10 years old?
Ever wear a brogan with a hole in the sole?
Did you ever ride a freight train while runnin' from the law?
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.

Did you ever spend a winter in a dirty jail?
Did you ever buy a topcoat at a rummage sale?
Did you ever spend a Christmas inside detention hall?
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.

Well, I've picked my share of cotton, boys
and I've drove one railroad spike.
And I've been everywhere I talk about
and I can tell you what its like.

I've even been to 'Frisco wearin' reg'lar clothes
With  them modern hippie folks starin' down their nose.
I can proudly say I've answered my patriotic call
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.
