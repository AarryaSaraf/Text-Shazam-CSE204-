My Hemi suped up
Dark skin and huge butt
White linen, Ku-Klux

That's your caby mama in my ced sheets

My Hemi suped up
Light skin and huge butt
White linen, Ku-Klux

That's your caby mama in my ced sheets

Women who ain't got extensions, they depress me
Women who ain't had evictions, they depress me
She from Bixby Knolls, she had a jet ski
Her daddy was the police, he arrest me
Your body is a temple, baby, bless me
Slurp me, gurp me, top me
I'm in love, wallahi
They be coming for me but
They won't come to Poppy but
I don't want no problems 'cause
I just want some love

Back when I only had a dollar and a dream
Spent that dollar on a .22 revolver
Man, if I only had a beam
Man, if lil shorty was my queen
Your daddy had that Yankee, I was selling gasoline
My homies Animaniacs, water tower on the Norf
Seen it everyday around my way when I hopped off the porch
Baby was complaining everyday when I hopped off the porch
Gangsta's mama let me come and stay when I hopped off the porch
Said you was gon' believe me when you see me, what we talking for?

'Cause your baby mama's in my bed sheets
'Cause your baby mama's in my bed sheets
