Remember growin' up, all I wanted was to be a thug
Wanted me a plug (Plug) to get a lil' bread
Shoot a couple niggas in the head
Still outside (Outside), I don't hide
From this shit for life

Visit my Crips that lay (Lay)
Under the ground, runnin' around (Yeah)
We was them kids that played (Dead homies)
All in the street, followin' leads
Of niggas who lost they ways (Dead homies)
Some of them outside still (Still)
Some of them inside graves
I'm a real beach boy (I'm a real beach boy)
Come ride my wave (Wave)

Fill these voids or fill my bank (Ayy, ayy)
Blue strips only, you switched on me
Mama told me 'bout you snakes
Keep my shit off safety (Yeah)
You know you can never be too safe (You know it)

// LAW OF AVERAGES //

Fuck a bitch, I don't trust no bitch with my government
Fuck a friend, I don't want no friends with no open hands
Count my bands, all alone at home, don't you call my phone
Everyone that I've ever known asked me for a loan
Leave me 'lone, .44 Stallone, get a nigga gone
Raging bull, this not Paid In Full but I kill my own
Yes I love you 'cause you black, but don't love yo ass like that

// SUNDOWN TOWN //

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Where you're from, where you're from)

Yeah, I could die tonight, so today I'm finna go get paid
I'm the violent type so don't play 'less you want yo grave
We was in the hood, rent was late, ain't have section 8
Had a.38 in the 8th, moved on 68th
Then they put us out, we was sleeping on my auntie couch
Then she put us out, stomach growling, stealing from the Ralph's
If I pull it out Ima send a nigga to the clouds
Watch them bullets bounce, fell in love with guns, I love the sound, yeah

From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah
From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah

I don't fear no man, only Allah got the upper hand
Lost too many friends to the down the streets, I can't pretend
That I'll make amends, I know that the blood gon' spill again
Hanging on them corners same as hanging from a ceiling fan
When I see my fans I'm too paranoid to shake they hands
Clutching on the blam, don't know if you foe or if you fam
I don't gotta plan, I'm just out here thuggin' till the end
Niggas know I'll never fold or bend, yeah

From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah
Tryna run it up, I'm running wild, yeah
From the sun up till the sun is down, yeah

// THE SHINING //

Don't get murdered, lil' niggas out here with no purpose
Loaded lurking, rather get flipped than go flip burgers
Cayenne swerving, niggas ain't built like that in person
City burning, can't be saved with no sermon
Still in search of, ain't no N.E.R.D.
Left some enemies on that curb, I can not be perturbed
I live out every word I put inside my verse, I
Know my mama proud these, haters wanna down me, please

It's not what you think?
I could be gone in a blink, I don't wanna leave
It's not what you thought
We dying broke or live or with broken hearts
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene

Greener grasses, made it out, don't make shit for the masses
When in traffic, no, you can't be giving out no passes
Fuck a mansion, asked when I'ma move to Malibu or Calabasas
I can't never do it, I'm too active, she attractive
But she plastic I can't get with that shit
She the baddest, but out here doing bad how that happen?
Yes, he rapping but, he ain't got no bag, how that happen?
Yes, I'm cracking but, hard to understand how it happened

It's not what you think?
I could be gone in a blink, I don't wanna leave
It's not what you thought
We dying broke or live or with broken hearts
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene

// THE APPLE & THE TREE //

Hey, look here, I done, I die Rip, I, like I told Nicole
I said, "Hey, I done got on the witness stand and lied my ass off
So, so your daddy didn't go to jail
For tryna shoot somebody"
I said and I done, I said you know and I ain't even know I had did that
I had forgot I had did it, I was looking for it
And I, I, I, I, had to be kinda out of my mind, but I was angry
You know sometimes when I got angry I didn't think
So I, I done went over somebody house
I knew the girl, I knew them people in the house and everything
But I'm over there looking for somebody
You know tryna get a nigga, you know what I mean?
I'm like shit
And they said, "You don't remember that time you came over our house, girl, looking for so-and-so?"
Ooh, we didn't even open up the door
We like damn, she at the door, I ain't, I ain't gon' open it!
You know I'm like damn, I must've been real stupid
Hehe, but I'm just saying, to the point where I'm tryna make is where I came from
You know what I mean?
You know I was singing in the choir with a gun in my purse
So don't go there with me
Don't tell me what, I don't care what you want, you dead

// TAKE ME HOME //

I don't wanna die but I will for the cause
Swallowing my pride like them pills y'all be you off
I hate when you high but you hate feeling lost
I hate every time that you ask, "Can we talk?"

Tell me what I did now, drying off your tears now
Fighting for some years now, something's gotta give
I don't want a rebound, I just wanna sleep sound
Don't wanna dream' bout the shit I done did
You know these trips come with baggage, been all cross this atlas
But keep coming back to this place 'cause it trapped us
I preach what I practice, these streets all I've known
And it's no place like home

Ooh
Take, take, take me home like I clicked my shoes
I'm up, the price is sky high
They say their two cents, I'm fine
I got no sense I fly like
Ooh ah, ooh ah
Only abide by my rules

Yeah, I'm on PCH going South, blower on the seat
With the windows down, music loud, let 'em hear the beat
When it's quiet out I hear the sound of those who rest in peace
Tryna drown the violence out but let 'em say that they want beef
And we riding out, finding out where them niggas be
If they hanging out lay 'em out airing out the street
Then it's out the way, outta state, please don't tell on me
Don't need no more felonies, all these broken memories

I be solo dolo, never know who working with police
When I hit the set It's loaded, I don't know who envy me
I'm the only one who made it out, you remember me?
Is you a frenemy? You plan on killing me? No?

Ooh
Take, take, take me home like I clicked my shoes
I'm up, the price is sky high
They say their two cents, I'm fine
I got no sense I fly like
Ooh ah, ooh ah
Only abide by my rules

And I make mistakes sometimes, I
I try
I can't tell you who's an ally
I can't tell you who, who
