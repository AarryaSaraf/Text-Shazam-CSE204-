I've been waiting my whole life (Been waiting, still waiting)
Drifting slowly through the night (Been drifting, still drifting)

Feet don't fail me know
Move without a sound
The Shadow of a doubt
We see it from the underground
Feet don't fail me know
Move without a sound
The Shadow of a doubt
We see it from the underground

Coming to ya door bout to take my money
Talk that shit boy you don't mean nothing
Moving with the jackals and hanging with the junkies
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Everybody, everybody, everybody running
Smile to your face but they all want something
Coming to your door bout to take my money
Fuck the government cause they never gonna love me
Get up


I've been waiting
Too much time, I'm impatient
Pressure rising I might go diamond
Outcasted I might get blasted
Move softly bright lights get off me
Unfortunately, I'm fortunate
Wealth is still disproportionate
Bloodshot eyes behind Porsche tints
Find me on the 91 freeway
Deep thoughts of my life on replay
Pack heat you know fat meat greasy
They say life too short but not easy
I say what I want I'm not P.C
You know black folks killed when police, please
Just seen one on the TV
Make about 3 this week

I believe that this whole world is all wretched
I believe the human mind always fooling itself
I believe they wanna keep us wondering what's next
I believe they feed us poison for we won't connect
Rising and running tossing and turning columns are burning
Deja vu or discernment
Sickening makes me vomit
Seems like a broken promise
Vacancy that's atomic
Maybe it's Nostradamus
Maybe this shit is common

Cold in a warm city don't know what to do
They'll poison the flock but you gotta stay true
Trouble in my way yea I might have to cry
I know when I get that Rolex I can't take it when I die
Can't take it when I die
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up (Still waiting, still waiting, fuck the government)
Get up
