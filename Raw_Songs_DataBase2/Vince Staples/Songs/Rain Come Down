When the sun go down
When the jay go 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down

Rain come down, Rain come down
Rain come down, Rain come down
Rain come down, Rain come down
Rain come down (and the rain)
Rain come down, Get your man laid down
You don't know, know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know, know, know
(Rain come down)
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know
(Rain, rain, rain)
Know, know, know, know, know, know, know
Rain come down


I'm the man, ten toes in the street
I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose in the Sphinx
Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on the side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Ride in the drop top, so I think
Might get JFK'd up, if not I prayeth
I\If so, no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre day off
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Louisville Brown on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete


When the sun go down
When the jay go 'round
In the middle of the night

Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need the fire
On prison time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Cover Girl, but her chest flat
Toothpaste spread in the CLR
Or, I think it was for Wayne
Can't remember springing for it, bring it on the plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Call Ca-lal-lane
She getting naked undercover's for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain, in the club
Don't you dream on how it feel to be in love?
What you drunk? You need a bus?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound


When the sun go down
When the jay go 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down

Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
(And the rain)
Rain come down
Get your main laid down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Rain come down)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Rain come down)
