Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet
Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet (Yeah)

Money talk, broke niggas talk louder (Yeah)
That's why they face so sour
Ain't shit sweet, ask Suga Free (Aye, Suga Free)
Still bust a nigga head, it's the hood in me (Hey)
From the ghetto by the beach, bullets in the breeze
I got million dollar dreams, I got nigga needs
Baby from around the way say she feeling me
Wanna get with me, make the memory
Think she tryna set me up
She sent a late night text saying, "Let's meet up"
No way, I heard you kick it with the enemies (No way)
And if a nigga think I'm slippin then he getting wings
XD. 40 with the lemon squeeze (Bang)
Hold seventeen, clutch it I'ma air the scene
Sweet dreams, trippin' on everything (On the hood)
Really with it, so you better be, aye (Yeah)

Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet
Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet (Aye, tell 'em where you from)

I come from where everybody thirsty (Thirsty)
Got some money now these niggas wanna hurt me (Tell me, why?)
How another nigga getting to it get you mad?
You should go and get some cash 'fore I get you crash
Really living fast, die young by the gun
We don't wanna know your name, tell us where you from
I done ran it up, an M but it's not enough
Used to kick it in they hood till we shot it up, aye
It's no friends in the gangland
Started with a skateboard and a spraycan
Pull up on they main block going Rain Man
Money talks, Crips walk, niggas ain't playing
Heavy stepping if I wanna get to Heaven
I'ma have to hit the gate, did too many 211's
Tryna break that bank like ScHoolboy said
Won't stop till the whole hood fed, on my granny's grave (Yeah)

Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet
Feeling like ice cold lemonade
Nowhere to go when we in the shade
Nowhere to go when we in the cage
Sometimes life tastes bittersweet (Yeah)

Ice cold, baby, ice cold
They think I'm pippin', baby
Summertime in the LB
Oh, what a feeling, baby
But it's for you, yeah, ooh-ooh, oh

Summertime in the shade (Lemonade)
Ice cold lemonade
Summertime in the shade
Feeling like, feeling like
Ice cold lemonade, yeah
Summertime in the shade
Ice cold lemonade
Feeling like, feeling like
