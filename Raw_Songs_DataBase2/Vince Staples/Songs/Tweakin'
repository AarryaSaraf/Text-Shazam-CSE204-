This for the ones
(Never had none and never been bought)
Live by the gun
(Die by the gun, rifle sun)
Grind for the Ghost
(World for my girl, rise for the hogs)
Slide for the cross
(Ride for the cross, nine to your dome)


Work hard in the wild, bounty found
Never checks, never count
I suggest you pout
I'ma send this nigga out, get blessed by the God
Don't get clapped on
Just a young black man with a backbone
In the back come home, come black on
In the Batmobile, Black Malcolm, yeah
When Jibari died was off the porch for homicides
Then when Hefe died, I bought some things to pass the gas
But when Johnny died all I had was shows booked
Down to burn in hell, I don't care how my soul look
I know you gon' tell, I can tell by your fro's look
But I love you still, flaws and all, you my dawg
Put me behind bars and all 'cause we came up out the park
It's just crazy seeing everybody change when things get hard


We just lost somebody else this weekend, no no
Think that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah yeah
Nothing out of something I was leaving
Tryna find my piece of mind, it's litting

I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'


Look at how far we done came (yeah)
Now I'm a face and a name (yeah)
Just gotta call 'bout my tweets (yeah)
Told me to watch what I'm sayin' (yeah)
Just got a call 'bout the streets (yeah)
Told me to watch for a Jeep (yeah)
Liberty lurk in the east (yeah)
They hoppin' out ready to squeeze (yeah)
Niggas emotional nowadays
Lyin', they hide their coward ways
Crying in court when they catch a case
Off of the porch at eleven grade
Call in the week, when my mama prayed
Prolly why none of my karma came
Just put the Benz in my mama name
Family first, I can't get re-raised
Had me up in church at a young age
Should've had the nigga at the gun range
Woulda been a lot more useful shit
Who up in the pulpit truthful shit
Bunch of poor people gon' use the shit
Might as well go and get used to it
Tryna get rich, get everybody fed
But everybody dead


We just lost somebody else this weekend, no no
Think that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah yeah
Nothing out of something I was leaving
Tryna find my piece of mind, it's litting

I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'
I'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'


Look how far we came
Look how far we came

Big Boy's Neighborhood that's "Tweakin'" right there, man
Y'all stick around, y'all radio's right here in Big Boy Neighborhood
