Money mantra
Hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash ya
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up

Kept it stitch lipped, I'm a factor
I was out there when it mattered
Had the chopstick with the ladder
Made it count, fled to Atlanta

Off to Camp Creek, with no Plan C
I was head first, understand me?
Gotta stay alert, understand me?
If they catch me, they gon' blast me

Bounced out, chucking up the hood
Money in the bank, so I'm feeling good
Pull up on the gang, never Hollywood
Showing them the way, so they show a nigga love, but

These lil' niggas running wild
Bought a .40 cal, out the Jordan Downs
Married to the streets, don't she get around?
I never wanna leave, I'm never out of bounds

Ain't no peacing up if you body one of us
Body for a body, big body Benz truck
Bounce out boogie, play pussy, get fucked
When these niggas get tough?

Since when these niggas want war with us?
Lick a gunshot, bloodshot corneas
I been out all night tryna make it out
Swear to God that the set was the safest route, know what they about

Money mantra
Hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash ya
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up

Kept it stitch lipped, I'm a factor
I was out there when it mattered
Had the chopstick with the ladder
Made it count, fled to Atlanta

I took big risks, now I want big fish
A billion dollars at the top of my to-do list
Buy a villa in St. Bart, maybe a cruise ship
Or really a yacht
Just to say that I got it
Product of my environment

Keep my cutter for the snakes, you know this shit can get slimy
Ain't have to make no call to gang, them they already beside me
Where the money at? That's more than likely where you can find me
I can't undo that, you know that shit was sold when you tried it
This shit crazy, nobody want to put in no work
But want to get paid, though
I'ma keep on spinning on lawyers until the case closed
I'm probably not coming up, not the one you should wait on
I want this shit back, hope it don't take long

Everybody called me with their problems, now they check on me
They said if it happened, then it's me to be, guess we'll see
I know you was lying when you had told me you would never leave
I can't keep on going back and slump, I gotta let it be

(Money, mansion, hundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed
Better not slip, I'ma crash, yeah
You ain't shot shit, get your stats up
Kept the sticks lit, I'm a factor
I was out there, when it mattered)
