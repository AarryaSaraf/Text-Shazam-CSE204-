I think it's wrong, but then it's called survival
You have to eat
You have to pay bills
You have to survive
So when you get used to pulling a trigger on somebody
It's not hard to pick up a gun and just shoot
You know? It's not hard after a while
It becomes easy, calming
And depending on the people that you're shooting at
And the reason for you doing it
It might even be fun

You shot someone?

That's what they said
Several times, that's what they said

Were they right?

I don't know
Bullets don't have names
