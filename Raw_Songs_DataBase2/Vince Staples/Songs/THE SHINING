Don't get murdered, lil' niggas out here with no purpose
Loaded lurking, rather get flipped than go flip burgers
Cayenne swerving, niggas ain't built like that in person
City burning, can't be saved with no sermon
Still in search of, ain't no N.E.R.D.
Left some enemies on that curb, I can not be perturbed
I live out every word I put inside my verse, I
Know my mama proud these, haters wanna down me, please

It's not what you think?
I could be gone in a blink, I don't wanna leave
It's not what you thought
We dying broke or live or with broken hearts
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene

Greener grasses, made it out, don't make shit for the masses
When in traffic, no, you can't be giving out no passes
Fuck a mansion, asked when I'ma move to Malibu or Calabasas
I can't never do it, I'm too active, she attractive
But she plastic I can't get with that shit
She the baddest, but out here doing bad how that happen?
Yes, he rapping but, he ain't got no bag, how that happen?
Yes, I'm cracking but, hard to understand how it happened

It's not what you think?
I could be gone in a blink, I don't wanna leave
It's not what you thought
We dying broke or live or with broken hearts
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene
Blower with a beam
Shine when I hit the scene
