Ah
Ah
If everybody stopped so much hurt, stopped so much anger they hoard
We done lost a gang of homeboys
A lot of people, a lot of my friends got hurt
Nobody's got a lotta anger in here, so first thing, we're gonna snap at it

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Shoot a nigga momma if she out while we sliding
Go up in the house, cause, this shit get violent
Better keep your mouth shut if we hear sirens
I'ma be on death row just like Suge Knight 'nem
I stand ten toes, I'm not no buster
Seen 'em by the Winco, worked on my jumper
Baby know I'm hotter than the city in the summer
'Fore I leave the house I gotta tell her that I love her
I don't know if I'ma make it home
These niggas ain't gang banging they just singing songs
I done seen it all, bloodshot eyes
Broke my heart in the set and I'm still outside
Took a loss, took a risk, now I'm back in the mix
Watch who you keeping around when you rich
Money ain't make me
Still thuggin' till the feds come take me
Mean muggin'

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Foot up on the gas, hunnid on the dash
Blower in the stash, thirty in the mag
Hung on Cherry Ave, I ain't go to class
They don't say what's up 'cause they know it's that
In too deep, I ain't with the peace
Wanna end the beef? Tell them niggas bring my homies back
Free the Killa, he was on attack
Bitches wanna know my zodiac
Every time I fall in love, baby, do me bad
Giving up, when I went and gave it all I had
I will never chase the cat, rather chase a bag
Have fun, life short when you living fast
I'm a nigga in the set, baby, go and ask
Never go out sad, give the bro my last
If I die today, they gon' go and crash
That's on Tiny Skrap, that's on Lil' Half (Aye)

Trophy in the hood, aye
Wish a nigga would, aye
Got my weight up
Now I'm feeling good, aye
Now a nigga on, aye
I done came a long way
If I had one wish
I'd free the homies

Ah
Ah
