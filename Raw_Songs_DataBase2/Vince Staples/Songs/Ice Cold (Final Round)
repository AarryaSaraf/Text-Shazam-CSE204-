How dare you walk from me
I'm where I always be
It's all downhill from here

Ice cold you know? (Ice cold)
I go ain't go for broke (I go)
No joke, want smoke
I ain't mad at you though
I've scrap before
I'm strapped, compact
I've clapped before

Who wanna meet they maker?
Who wanna meet they savior?
I'm in a big house now
Who never seen they neighbors?
Who wanna see my greatness?
Best believe I'm pay-per-view
Best believe I'm made for feuds
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous

Who wanna meet they maker?
Who wanna meet they savior?
Who wanna see my greatness?

Best believe I'm Pay-per-view
Rest believe I'm made for feuds
Boy better shoot, stay dangerous
This for the rich and famous
This for the broke and basic
Better stay out my way
I want it, I take it
I'm on it, I'm jaded
I'm more than amazing
I'm scoring, so who keepin' count here?
Just don't count me out here, you know?
