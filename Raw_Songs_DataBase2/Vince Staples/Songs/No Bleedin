Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)

Bleedin' me, bleedin' me


Dead homies, where they at?
We be slidin' with the wop
Dead homies, see the rat
He be sidin' with the cops
Dead homies, where they at?
Don't be hidin' with a sack
Dead homies gettin' slick
If you actin' out of pock'
Feds on me, hit the gate
Double back and hit the block
Feds on me, skippin' state
I'ma buy another spot
Bread on me for the case
I ain't never gettin' caught
And if you win, I'll take it on the chin
And take it to the box, dead homies

I want whatever that you want, let's get it brackin'
Ain't with that talkin' bullshit, I want that action
I need it all up front, that's what I want
Play and get stumped, I get active
No I cannot stay in, I go dumb outside
I keep my hand on a cup of ice
Know I'm with the shits, I pull up, I slide
When the drama's high, I pull homicide
Click, clack, bang, bitch, I stay dangerous
You can't be friendly when you bangin'
Pushin' hard lines, talkin' brass, bitch
Talkin' reckless all up on the net, bitch


Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me (Oh no, cuz)
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Head on a swivel, no bleedin' me
Bleedin' me, bleedin' me
