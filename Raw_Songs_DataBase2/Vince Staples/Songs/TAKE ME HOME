I don't wanna die but I will for the cause
Swallowing my pride like them pills y'all be you off
I hate when you high but you hate feeling lost
I hate every time that you ask, "Can we talk?"

Tell me what I did now, drying off your tears now
Fighting for some years now, something's gotta give
I don't want a rebound, I just wanna sleep sound
Don't wanna dream' bout the shit I done did
You know these trips come with baggage, been all cross this atlas
But keep coming back to this place 'cause it trapped us
I preach what I practice, these streets all I've known
And it's no place like home

Ooh
Take, take, take me home like I clicked my shoes
I'm up, the price is sky high
They say their two cents, I'm fine
I got no sense I fly like
Ooh ah, ooh ah
Only abide by my rules

Yeah, I'm on PCH going South, blower on the seat
With the windows down, music loud, let 'em hear the beat
When it's quiet out I hear the sound of those who rest in peace
Tryna drown the violence out but let 'em say that they want beef
And we riding out, finding out where them niggas be
If they hanging out lay 'em out airing out the street
Then it's out the way, outta state, please don't tell on me
Don't need no more felonies, all these broken memories

I be solo dolo, never know who working with police
When I hit the set It's loaded, I don't know who envy me
I'm the only one who made it out, you remember me?
Is you a frenemy? You plan on killing me? No?

Ooh
Take, take, take me home like I clicked my shoes
I'm up, the price is sky high
They say their two cents, I'm fine
I got no sense I fly like
Ooh ah, ooh ah
Only abide by my rules

And I make mistakes sometimes, I
I try
I can't tell you who's an ally
I can't tell you who, who
