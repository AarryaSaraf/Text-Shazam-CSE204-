Guns and roses, another young boy lost, another fallen soldier
Younger brother tears falling on his mother shoulder
She got some tears of her own, wished she had loved him stronger.
13 but he grown, you see the gun he holding
That was made for a man, the rush he get when he load it
Is one you won't understand, unless you hold it and blow it
Granny moved from New Orleans searching for better life
Her troubled cardiac is all she got
Eating at McDonald's by the laundomat
Daughter was 17, she just want to know where the party at
Met somebody that night, fucked him, he never called her back
Now her oldest bastard son sitting in that casket young

Guns and roses, another young girl lost, you see her heart was broken
She used to love so strong, until she got done wrong
Ain't wanna feel no guilt, she blamed it all on home
But still it felt so real, and since she lied so well
Her parents never could tell where she was really at
Now is it really love, or is it just another lie to fuck inside his mama truck
Raw like the emotions of her crying that night
Her pillow soaked, she missed the hope she had as a kid
But he doing all the things that her dad never did
He'll be the dad of the kid if she had it, but still he'd rather not
Steal her mother's car, hit the bar just to grab a shot
From the guns and roses
Living young and hopeless

Guns and roses, I had it all in my home but mother never noticed
The neighborhood where I roamed was known for countless encounters of people pressing they line
I try to stay in my boundary, when bounty's placed on your head for shit you never had did
You just conform to survive, not trying sit in no pit, I like me better alive
357's for 6, 11 fit in your 9
I take them both when I dip cause I ain't dying today
The shit's a game that we play what you bang where you stay
Before you answer just spray, they'll never see it coming
Hit a man, woman, child or dog cause it's mine before yours, its 2 weapons of war

Its guns and roses
Young
Victim of the guns and roses
