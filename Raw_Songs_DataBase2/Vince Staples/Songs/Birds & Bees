Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me


Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy
My mama caused another problem when she had me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
Stackin' paper, I'm a gangsta like my granny
It's money over everything if you ask me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
I'm stoppin', poppin' like a shootin' guard
My seat is back, I'm too relaxed, not movin' out this car
I shot your child, so what, you know we wildin' after dark
The sun come down and guns come out, you know Ramona Park
Bandana brown, my skin is brown, I'm fightin' wit' the law
We runnin' 'round the city, east, west and the north
G check, better leap if you feelin' frog
You wit' the shit, getcho feet wet wit' the sharks





Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me


Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy
