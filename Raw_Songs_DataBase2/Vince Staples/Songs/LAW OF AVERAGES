Fuck a bitch, I don't trust no bitch with my government
Fuck a friend, I don't want no friends with no open hands
Count my bands, all alone at home, don't you call my phone
Everyone that I've ever known asked me for a loan
Leave me 'lone, .44 Stallone, get a nigga gone
Raging bull, this not Paid In Full but I kill my own
Yes I love you 'cause you black, but don't love yo ass like that
I will put you on a shirt if you fuck me out my racks

Cherry Ave, Downey Ave, ho you average
Louis bag, Gucci bag, you got baggage
I will never give my money to a bad bitch
I will never give my money to a bad bitch
Dairy Ave, Locust Ave, ho you average
Birkin bag, Chloe bag, you got baggage
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic

AMG's & SMG's, I'm into that shit, aye
Wasn't what he thought, we caught him like a catfish, aye
Niggas fallin' out and screaming like they baptist, aye
Only love her if she ratchet aye, if that ass sit, aye
Got a squabble now he Cassius Clay
But I'm Hurricane Carter, you know I'm gon' catch a case
But Lil Wayne Carter what I call my .38
Kiss your baby in the face if you play with where I stay babe

Cherry Ave, Downey Ave, ho you average
Louis bag, Gucci bag, you got baggage
I will never give my money to a bad bitch
I will never give my money to a bad bitch
Dairy Ave, Locust Ave, ho you average
Birkin bag, Chloe bag, you got baggage
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic
You will never catch me slippin' out in traffic (Yeah)
