Yeah nigga im out here shinin
You see me bitch, I dont see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on twitter though
Where you hidin at? Imma find you
Little word of advice bitch nigga
Dont sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma's house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it to
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me


Tell all the girls clap your hands
You comin' out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands
But I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can someone tell them broads
They comin' out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all
Where's my round of applause at?
We cashin' all checks
Don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime

I'm takin' niggas bitches
Like Bowser, I pound her
You hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
Niggas act like the women
They crying over, Invite her over
Dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route
Where everything I do
Where some little shit to me
Could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring
To a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical
Been crackin' hoes since secondary school
We trappin' hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga
