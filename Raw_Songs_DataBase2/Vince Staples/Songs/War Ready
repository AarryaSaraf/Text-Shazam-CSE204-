Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God... with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock a... put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay


Born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, war ready, your boys' lost already

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think I'm heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or I'm embracing silly
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thing to a G
Life give lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Coke game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fucked to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, hell, free, jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit
A wise man once said that a black man better off dead
So I'm, war ready
