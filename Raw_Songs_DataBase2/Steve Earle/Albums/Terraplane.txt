// Baby Baby Baby (Baby) //

Baby I got a gold deal way out South
A little town that I call shut my mouth
I thousand miles we don't need no plane
Call her on the phone and it's ringing like you see
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

I wanna hold her but I know I can't
I'm on the field when the sky is blue
Call her on the phone and tell her what I wanna do
She says

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby I'll find you
You got me hanging on the telephone line
Walkin' up the ceiling
And bouncing on the walls
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Can'tyou answer to my call?

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
