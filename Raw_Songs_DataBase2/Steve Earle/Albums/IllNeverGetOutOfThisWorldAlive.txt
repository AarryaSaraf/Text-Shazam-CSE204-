Album: IllNeverGetOutOfThisWorldAlive

// Waitin' On The Sky //

I grew up in a military town
Waitin' on the sky to fall 
Everybody I knew hanqin' around wonderin' 
What they'd do when the Draft Board called 
Lookin' back it musta been a miracle
How I ever grew up at all 
To sing about livin' in a military town 
Waitin' on the sky to fall 
Waitin' on the sky to fall, boys 
Waitin' on the sky to fall 
Chicken Little wasn't makin' nothin' but noise
Waitin' on the sky to fall 

Spent a lonely lifetime rollin' down the line
Searchin' for the Holy Grail
Never once crossed my solitary mind
That any such consecrated quest'd fail
Came upon an ocean and much to my chagrin
They told me that ship had sailed
Walkin' on the water cause I never learned
To swin searchin' for the Holy Grail
Searchin' for the Holy Grail, friends
Searchin' for the Holy Grail
Been across the oceans and now I'm back again
Searchin' for the Holy Grail

Been around enough to know a little bit now
And I'm sitting on tip of the world
Wangin' on a guitar while the sun goes down
And singin a song about a redheaded girl
Was a time I would have said those days were gone
But I'm givin' it another whirl
Didn't know that I was gonna live this long
Now I'm sitting' on top of the world
Sittin' on top of the world, y'all
Sittin' on top of the world
Eyes wide open until the Messenger calls
Sittin' on top of the world

// Little Emperor //

Hey little Emperor, come down from your throne
The hourglass is empty, your time has come and gone
The battlements are crumblin' the walls are tumblin' down
Your counselors and concubines are getting' out of town
Some say it's an omen, some say it's the winds of change
Which every way it's going' it's blowin' like a hurricane
Hey little conqueror, where you gonna go?
The world is even smaller than it was when you left home
Emptiness in front of you and detritus behind
Nobody ever told you that history was kind
Standin' on the corner, your fortune blowin' in the wind
Daddy didn't warn that there ain't no going home again

No pomp and circumstance, no more shock and awe
You're just a little emperor, that's all

Hey little hypocrite, what you gonna say
When you wind up standin' naked on the final judgment day
How you gonna justify it, who you gonna call
What if it turns out God doesn't look like you at all
The leaves are in the teacup, the hieroglyphics on the wall
You ain't the first to rise up, you sure won't be last to fall

Hey little emperor, come down from your throne
And let another emperor climb on

// The Gulf Of Mexico //

Come and gather 'round me people
And a tale to you I'll tell
Of my father and his father
In the days before the spill
With an endless sky above 'em
And a restless sea below
And every blessin'  flowing from the Gulf of Mexico

From my Granddad with the shrimp boats
From the time that he was grown
And he scrimped and saved and bought himself
A trawler of his own
He was rough and he was ready
And he drank when he was home
And he made his family's living on the Gulf of Mexico

We were rolling
We were rolling
Past the deep blue water
He was rolling

Well my Daddy drove a crew boat
Hauling workers to the rigs
He was sick of mending nets
And couldn't stand the smell of fish
He drew a steady paycheck
20 years at Texico
When he died they spread his ashes
On the Gulf of Mexico

We were rolling
We were rolling
Past the deep green water
He was rolling

As for me, I think of nothing
Any grander than the day
That I stepped out on the drillin'  floor
To earn a roughneck's pay

Then one night I swear I saw the devil
Crawlin' from the hole
And he spilled the guts of hell out in the Gulf of Mexico

We were rolling
We were rolling
'Cross the blood red water
We were rolling

// Molly-O //

In the shadow of a chestnut tree I hide 
sword and a pistol by my side 
long come a traveler - lay him low 
all for the love of my Molly-O 
I left my family left my home 
out in the wicked world to roam 
no road so low I won't go down
for the love of my Molly-O 

Oh Molly
Oh Molly
Oh Molly 
All for the love of my Molly-O

I love Molly, God only knows
Molly love diamonds, pearls and gold
Bangles, Beads and Bells I bring
But Molly won't wear no wedding ring

Men have died for lesser things
Vengeance, Country, God and King
Someday I'll swing from the gallows pole
A final dance for my Molly-O

// God Is God //

I believe in prophecy.
Some folks see things not everybody can see.
And,once in a while,they pass the secret along to you and me.

And I believe in miracles.
Something sacred burning in every bush and tree.
We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing.

Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain't me.

I've traveled around the world,
Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness.
Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust.

And as our fate unfurls,
Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less.
Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust.

And I believe in God, but God ain't us.

God,in my little understanding, don't care what name I call.
Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all.

I receive the blessings.
That every day on Earth's another chance to get it right.
Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night.

Just another lesson
Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got.
Maybe this is why I'm here on Earth, and maybe not.

But I believe in God, and God is God.

// Meet Me In The Alleyway //

I had a melancholy malady 
Went to see the doctor and the doctor say 
Too bad, nothin' he could do 
He knew a man in Louisiana if I'm willin' to pay 
Laid my money on the barrelhead 

Man behind the bar began to shimmy and shake 
Can't lie, I reckoned I was dead 
When he picked my money up and I heard him say 
Meet me in the alleyway minute to midnight 
Don't be late meet me in the alleyway 
Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait 
Thirteen tiger teeth in my talisman 
St. John the Conqueror and a black cat bone 
Been seen walkin' with the guardians 
Now I'm in the alley and I'm all alone 
Can't run, can't hide from destiny 
Knew this day was callin' nearly all of my life 
Been done ain't the only boy from Tennessee 
To carve his name in cypress with a jawbone knife 

So you wanna be the king of America 
Say you wanna know the oracle's mind 
Say you wanna see the Marquesses of Mardi Gras 
dancin' with the devil at the end of the line

// Every Part Of Me //

I love you with all my heart
All my soul, every part of me
It's all I can do to mark
Where you end and where I start you see

Labored long in my travails, I left a trail of tears behind me
Been in love so many times
Didn't think this kind
Would ever find me

I love you with everything, all my weakness
All my strength
I can't promise anything except that my last breath
Will bear your name

And when I'm gone they'll sing a song
About a lonely fool who wandered around the world and back again
But in the end he finally found her

I love you with all my heart
All my soul and every part of me

Across the universe I'll spin until the end and then I wonder
If we should get another chance
Could I have that dance forever under
A double moon and scarlet stars shining down on where you are

And I love you with all my heart
All my soul and every part of me

// Lonely Are The Free //

Lonely are the free
'Cause there ain't that many of them
They don't walk like you and me

They just tumble in the breeze
Lighter than a feather
All together, separately

That's how it's s'posed to be
No matter where they wander
From post to in between,
From here to over yonder,
There's no place for them to land
Lonely are the free

The silent are the strong
Not so much as a whisper
Tells you anything is wrong

You've known all along,
But you can't help but listen
And now the moment's gone.

It keeps you hanging on
Until the stillness signaling
The breaking of the dawn,
Is shattered by the sirens
Singing sacrificial songs
The silent are the strong.

That's all they used to see
A violent shadow passing 'cross
The sun so fleetingly
That if you have to ask you miss it
Anyway you see
Lonely are the free
Lonely are the free

// Heaven Or Hell //

I'm rollin' down a blacktop highway
Hole in my chest cause my heart's in your hands
I know it ain't OK but I can't stop wantin' you
I do the best that I can
I'm starin' in a highbeam headlight
Burnin' your name on the back of my brain
I swear I hear you callin'
I might have to turn around 
Cause I'm goin' insane

I love you baby but i just can't tell 
This kinda love comes from heaven or hell 
Heaven or hell 
Heaven or hell 

New moon against a long dark midnight blue 
ain't a star any brighter than you 
I look in your eyes and I see that spark inside 
and it's all I can do to keep tellin' myself 
there ain't no way you're gonna do me like you did then
I'm standin' my ground on feet of clay
Oh no, here I go again

There ain't nothing nobody can do
There ain't nothing nobody can say
Get down on their knees and pray
OOH

// I Am A Wanderer //

I am a wanderer, feet on the ground,
Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds.
I own the star above some distant shore,
Wandering ever more.

I am a refugee torn from my land,
Cast off to travel this world to its end.
Never to see my proud mountains again
But I still remember them.

[Instrumental]

I am a labourer, sign round my neck:
"Will work for dignity, trust and respect".
Stand on this corner so you don't forget
I haven't had mine yet.

I am a prisoner pacing my cell,
Three steps and back, my corner of hell.
Lock me away and you swallow the key,
But some day I shall be free.

And I'll be a wanderer, feet on the ground,
Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds.
I own the star above some distant shore,
Wandering ever more.

// This City //

This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown 
Blood in the water and hell to pay 
Sky tear open and pain rain down 
Doesn't matter 'cause come what may 
I ain't ever gonna leave this town 
This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown 
Ain't the river or the wind to blame 
Everybody around here knows 
Nothin' holdin' back Ponchartrain 
Except for a prayer and a promise's ghost 
We just carry on diggin' our graves 
In solid marble above the ground 
Maybe our bones'll wash away 
But this city won't ever drown 
This city won't ever die 
Just as long as her heart beats strong 
Like a second line steppin' high 
Raisin' hell as we roll along 
Gentilly to the Vieux Carre 
Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown 
Singin' Jacamo fee-nah-nay 
This city won't ever drown 
Doesn't matter cause there ain't no way 
I'm ever gonna leave this town 
This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown
