Yellow moon, amber light
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
Another blue and lonesome night
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me

I knew I'd cry, when you were gone
Baby, baby, baby please come home to me
Thought I'd survive but I was wrong
Baby, baby, baby, please

Just as soon as you were out that door
I remembered what my life was like before
Now nothin's gonna be the same again
'Cause I'm lonelier than I was then
And I can't ever let this feelin' go
'Cause now I know

I stay up late wake up alone
Aw baby, baby, baby please come home to me

No matter what I say or do
I know I'll never get over losin' you
So I'm crossin' my heart and promisin'
If I get you in my arms again
I'm not ever gonna let you go
'Cause now I know

The doors unlocked
The light is on
Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
Baby, baby, baby, please
