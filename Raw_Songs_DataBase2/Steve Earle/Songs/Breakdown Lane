Baby, last night I was watchin' my headlights flashin' on the guard rail
Now it's early in the mornin' and I'm still runnin' like the devil was on my trail

Well, say why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay

Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
I feel my shotgun when I see my shadow
It's headed down the breakdown lane
Headed down the breakdown lane

Now I've heard all the songs about the endless highway
Sung a couple of 'em myself
But the road ain't nothin' but a place to go
When you ain't got anyplace else

Why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay

Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
I feel my shotgun when I can see my shadow
It's headed down the breakdown lane
Headed down the breakdown lane
