Darlin', I could tell we're through
That leavin' look's all over you
I'll be waitin' here no matter what you do
Call me if you need a fool

Go and find another guy
And if he don't believe your lies
You know there's someone who'll swear every word is true
Call me if you need a fool

They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to
They don't come back for more the way I always do
So if you ever change your mind
I'm not very hard to find
You can find me in the phone book under "Blue"
Call me if you need a fool

They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to
They don't come back for more the way I always do
So if you ever change your mind
I'm not very hard to find
You can find me in the phone book under "Blue"
Call me if you need a fool
Call me if you need a fool

Girl, it won't cost you a dime
To break my heart just one last time
Call collect and I'll just tell 'em "put her through"
Call me if you need a fool
