Well Loretta, she's a bar-room girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe

Her age is always 22
Her laughin' eyes a hazel hue
Spends my money like water falls
Loves me like I want her to

Oh Loretta, won't you say to me?
Darlin', put your guitar on
Have a little shot of booze
Play a blue and wailin' song

My guitar rings a melody
My guitar sings, Loretta's fine
Long and lazy, blonde and free
I can have her any time

Sweetest at the break of day
Prettiest in the settin' sun
She don't cry when I can't stay
'Least not till she's all alone

Loretta, I won't be gone long
Keep your dancin' slippers on
Keep me on your mind a while
I'll be back babe to make you smile

Loretta, she's a bar-room girl
Wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines
Tell me lies I love to believe
