New Jersey Turnpike
Cruisin' on a wet night
Beneath the refinery's glow
Out where the knee black water flow
License, registration
I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience
About the things that I done
Mister state trooper
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me

Maybe you got a kid
Maybe you got a pretty wife
Well, the only thing that I got
Has been botherin' me my whole life
Mister state trooper
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me

Now in the wee wee hours
Your mind gets hazy
Well, relay towers
Want to lead me to my baby
Now the radio is jammed up
With those talk show stations
It's just talk talk talk
'Till you're losin' your patience
Mister state trooper
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me
Please don't you stop me

Is there anybody out there?
Listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silver-o
Deliver me from nowhere
