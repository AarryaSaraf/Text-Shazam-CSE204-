I dreamed you were standing
On the edge of the world
And I thought I heard you call out
With one foot on the rock
And one a cloud
Was it just the wind that I heard
Close your eyes
This world won't stop spinning you know
Close your eyes
Why don't you just let go
Thousands of people searchin' out there
Most of em lookin' for love
But nothing is something
That there's plenty of
In time we'll all get our share
When I was a child
And they put me to bed
They always took care that I prayed
But the part that goes, if I should
Die fore I wake
Echoed all night in my head
