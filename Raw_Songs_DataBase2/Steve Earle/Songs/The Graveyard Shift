I work the graveyard shift - stay up all night long
You'll wake up someday
And find your good gal gone
If you don't treat your baby right
She'll come see me
Some lonely night

When the sun goes down
And the moon is gone
That's when I come around
Don't you think I won't

On the graveyard shift - stay up all night long
You'll wake up someday
And your good gal gone

I drive a Cadillac - rides just like a dream
All the pretty gals
Wanna ride with me
('Cause) I got what all the women want
I never say I do
When I really don't
