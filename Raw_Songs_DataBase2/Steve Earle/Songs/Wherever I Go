Well I was born on a rainy day
With a dark cloud hangin' down low
Now it follows me wherever I go
There were days I've sworn that I'd blow away
With the cold wind chillin' my bones
'Cause it follows me wherever I go

In the midnight hour when I'm all alone
There's a hurtin' deep down in my soul
And it follows me wherever I go
When the sun shines down on my heart it's gone
But there's another night comin' I know
'Cause it follows me wherever I go


I could drink corn whisky 'til my brain goes soft
I could run this highway 'til my wheels come off
And these blues keep comin' around
And follow me down

Well one of these days I'm gonna leave this town
But I won't have to travel alone
'Cause if follows me wherever I go



I wanna go somewhere where I can't be found
And I won't have to carry this load
But it follows me wherever I go
