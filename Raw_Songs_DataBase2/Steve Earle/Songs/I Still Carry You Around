Sweetheart last night I dreamed of you
You loved me like you used to do
Mornin' come and I woke up and found
I still carry you around


I still carry you around
Everywhere I travel now
No matter how I try to put you down
I still carry you around

I still just can't believe you're gone
Your memory haunts me from now on
I walk the streets of this old lonely town
I still carry you around



You're with me everywhere I go
In my heart and in my soul
Down every road, no matter where I'm bound
I still carry you around
