I'm the keeper of your heart
I keep the flame when we're apart
I'm the lover in your arms
Or a baby soft and warm
I'm a hero in your eyes
I'm a comfort when you cry
When you hurt me I'm your fool
But I'm nothin' without you


No I'm nothin' without you
It don't matter what I do
If I win or if I lose
Sweetheart I'm nothin' without you

I'm a beacon in the night
To show the way until it's light
I'm a stumbler in the dark
When I can't say what's in my heart

I'm a poet just the same
Every time I speak your name
I'm just a shadow when I'm blue
But I'm nothin' without you
