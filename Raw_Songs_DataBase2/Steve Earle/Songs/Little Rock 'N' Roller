Hey little guy, I can't believe you answered the phone
I guess I didn't know you could do that, God help me, have I been gone that long
I'm in a truck stop somewhere on the Arkansas line
They got all the big trucks here, boy, you ought to hear the big diesels whine
No little guy, your daddy won't be home for a while
It's gonna be another couple weeks and another couple thousand miles
So got to sleep little rock 'n' roller
Your daddy's up there knockin' 'em dead tonight
One of these days when you're a little older
You can ride the big bus and everything will be alright
Until that day you got your mama to hold you
Don't be afraid when she turns out the light
Cause I know there's an angel just for rock 'n' rollers
Watchin' over you and your daddy tonight

No little guy, don't bother your mamma right now
'Cause I only got a minute and I called to talk to you anyhow
I Know you miss me, God knows I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I got your picture in my wallet, it cheers me up sometimes when I'm blue
Well little guy, I'm gonna have to let you go
You know it's way past your bedtime, and they're tellin' me we gotta roll
