Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go
'Til I outrun your memory
I can't go home 'cause I can't face another day alone
Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me
I want to start all over new
But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go
'Til I outrun your memory

Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly
Just wanna go to someplace you won't be
I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high
Where no one knows what you done to me
A thousand miles between us now
And still some how
These blues'll track me down
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go
'Til I outrun your memory

I'm bound down that long lonesome highway 'cause it's the only place I know
Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me
Leave me alone 'cause it's a long way no matter where I go
Nothin' but blues as far as I can see
I wish I had you back again
But I know I can't
So here I go again
Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go
'Til I outrun your memory
