Here I am sittin' on your porch, dear
Beggin' you darlin', let me in
In total submission I have come here
Oh sweetheart, I know how bad I've been

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door

If you tell me you still love me
I won't drink or cuss no more
I won't call your mama ugly
And I won't chase women like before

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door
If you just opened up your door
