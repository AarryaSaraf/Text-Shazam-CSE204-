I didn't know
You'd be in this place tonight
Then again I thought you might
Now I don't know what to do
Does it show
When my poor heart skips a beat
Each and every time we meet
'Cause I'm still in love with you

There you are
Right across the room from me
Just the way I knew you'd be
Lookin' lonesome wild and blue
I'm alright so far
Just as long as you don't speak
That's what makes my knees go weak
'Cause I'm still in love with you

I've done everything I know
To get you off my mind
But sometimes I can't help but hope
That you won't walk away this time

Then I wouldn't have to watch you go
Wouldn't have to miss you so
'Cause I'm still in love with you

If I knew what I know now
I'd never let you leave
I'd make it up to you somehow
And darlin' you'd come back to me

Then I wouldn't have to watch you go
Wouldn't have to miss you so
'Cause I'm still in love with you
I wouldn't need to be so blue
Wouldn't want you like I do
'Cause I'm still in love with you
