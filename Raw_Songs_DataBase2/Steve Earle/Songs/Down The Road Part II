Woke up in the mornin' with the middle of nowhere blues
Nothin' in my pocket but a ticket that I can't use
Been hangin' around this town and it's startin' to show
Down the road I go

Standin' on the highway with the road burnin' through my shoes
Roll over Kerouac and tell Woody Guthrie the news
Heard it said there ain't nothin' ahead but I don't know
Down the road I go

Blowin' in the wind and flyin' like a cannonball
Never seen a city where I couldn't find a place to fall
But it's only a matter of time before I'm feelin' low
Down the road I go
Daddy was a Chevy mama was a Cadillac
I was gone as soon as I was born and I ain't been back
I'm a rounder and a friend to any old wind that blows
Down the road I go
