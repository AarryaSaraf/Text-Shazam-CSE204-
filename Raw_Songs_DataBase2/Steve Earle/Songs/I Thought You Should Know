I been watchin' you watchin' me
I could feel your eyes from way across the room
But now that I'm holdin' you close I can see
Ain't no way I'm gonna get around you
I won't tell you I don't need you tonight
I won't pretend I ain't burnin' inside
Your skin glowin' soft in the silver moonlight
The shadows where the promises hide
The bittersweet taste of your kiss
It's all more than I can resist

If you're thinkin' 'bout breakin' my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know

Maybe this is all that you want
Maybe you're just as lonesome as me
A shoulder that you can cry on
A warm safe place you can be
Someone to call in the middle of the night
When the ghosts in your bedroom won't rest
Two arms to hold you tight
I promise that I'll do my best
To give you everything I got to give
And keep your secrets for as long as I live
