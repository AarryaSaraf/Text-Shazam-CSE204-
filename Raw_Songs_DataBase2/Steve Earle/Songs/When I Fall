Late at night on some dark deserted highway
On my way to another lonesome town
I thought I might see the first light of a new day
As it lay like fool's gold on the ground


But whenever I'm feelin' low
I won't have to cry alone I know
'Cause you will answer when I call
If I soar above the clouds and then
I come crashin' back to earth again
You will catch me when I fall

All these years I've watched you trip and stumble
There were times that I feared that you were lost
But every tear that I dried after you tumbled
Comes to mind when I'm considerin' the cost



In my heart there's a place for you to run to
Anytime you're tired and hurt and blue
For my part I have only to remind you
You will find me waiting when you do
