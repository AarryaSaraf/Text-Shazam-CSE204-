She's a country girl
Young and pretty
She wanna see the world
So she headed for the city
She was entertained in all the right places
Knew half of the names, and all of the faces
Just a country girl
If her daddy could see her now
Just a country girl
Well you'd never recognize your little angel now
She comes down from way South,
She talks slow and lazy
When she opened her mouth the city boys went crazy
They fed her pink champagne, give her a headache
Cheap cocaine makes her meaner than a rattlesnake
Reelin' and a rockin' couldn't get enough
Crawlin' when the sun comes up
And payback's hell
There's a bag lady talkin' to her shopping cart
Don't you know the scary part
Is she saw herself
