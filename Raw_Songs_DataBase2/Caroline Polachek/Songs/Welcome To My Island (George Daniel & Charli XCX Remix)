I like to live my life luxurious
Eating caviar toast, buying out the Ritz
I've been told I can be tricky in relationships
'Cause I need someone who can take on all the challenges
I won't lie, yeah, I've always been afraid to commit
But now I've fallen so hard, it's a total eclipse
'Cause it's emotional and physical and so legit
He's got my legs wide out like banana split
We're always showering each other in expensive gifts
I put the two-tone Cartier on his wrist
It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed
I want a white dress, country side house, and kids
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
With my face enhanced and my natural lips
I told him, "Catch a flight, see if you can handle it
And if you can then, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I guess I'm on my Richard Branson wave
No virgin, but I knew just how to behave
'Cause I can be a good girl, buxom milkmaid
Or you can drive me down to Florida and fuck me for days
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
I've done a couple bad things if you catch my drift
I told him, "Baby, you can pull up on the landing strip
And if you do it right, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I wanna turn into you
I wanna turn into you
