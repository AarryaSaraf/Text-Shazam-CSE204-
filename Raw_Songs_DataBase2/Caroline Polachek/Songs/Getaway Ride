Pass the screwdriver
(Cha cha cha)
Here's a key
To the courtyard
By the cemetery
(Cha cha cha)
When the world is watching
I'll take the easy way out
To wait until your signal
While you burn the place down

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
(what now)
Of this
(this is)
Desire
(Cha cha cha)
I'm a thief
(Blind thief)
In the schoolyard
(baby)
Or just wanting to be
(Cha cha cha)
Breaking single file
Tell me you want to escape
Down the road to nowhere
To watch my heart break

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what?
And so what?

Ride! We can make it
Oh, I've all but lost my mind
Take the rest of me
Take it all
You're my destiny
Ooh
Baby don't be ashamed

Ride...
Ride...
