Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone, you can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend, oh
Forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
