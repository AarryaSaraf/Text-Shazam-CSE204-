These days
I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right
Instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me
Back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So many stories we were told about a safety net
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn the sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright because it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away (Let's ride away)
