We don't rely on "There's nowhere to go"
We realize that the soul grows
We just deny that the truth is untold
No one to rally us both

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long road home

Doesn't the sky look like maps to our house?
Doesn't the sea look so empty?
Even my dreams kissed in digital gloss
It's my reality

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long road home

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long way home
Alone

I don't
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna transform
