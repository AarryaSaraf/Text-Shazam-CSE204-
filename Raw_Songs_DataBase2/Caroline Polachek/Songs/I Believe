(Look over the edge, but not too far)

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe (Oh)
We'll get another day together (Oh)
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh (Oh)
No, I don't know but I believe

(Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh (Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe (Ah)

Violent love, feel my embrace
(Look over the edge, but not too far)
(But not too far)
