Why is your pretty friend wearing her collar high
Why does she turn away when you look at her in the eye?
It gives me the chills
It's like you to want the one
The one that you couldn't keep
Watch how she holds her breath
And leaves when you go to sleep

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

You'd give everything you have
If she'd just promise to come back
From her unexplained trips to the harbor
Where the tide runs black
There's no sense in trading places
To lock her up and keep her in the bath
Or learn how to hold her breath

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

Watching from the shore
No, you don't want to lose her
To the roar insatiable
Would you rather drown than say goodbye?
