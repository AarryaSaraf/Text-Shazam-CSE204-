Love
What a mean
Poison arrow welcome to me
What a shot
When I
Bent over to tie shoe laces
Cut it out
At the seed
And the rip is a rotation
Drawing O
In the sky
With no answers in the jury

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Backwards and up, up, up up

Take the wheel

Oh, the driver is fine
But the passenger is carsick
Back it up
Turn around
Like a ferris wheel I shift it
"Oh, it burns
But it cleans"
Say the nurses in their tunics
"Just admit
You were wrong
It's the opposite of foolish"

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and up, up, up up

Backwards
Backwards
Uh huh, backwards, backwards
Words, words, words
