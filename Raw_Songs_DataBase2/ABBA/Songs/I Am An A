 I am Frida. hello.
I'm the star of the show.
 That's what she thinks, anyway.
 And I like to perform.
Benny says I am warm.
 Well hot is the least you can say.
 Independant and free,
And ambitious, that's me.
And I'm tough too, you see.
 No she's not. Just ask me.
 Singing and dancing is what I like best.

 I am an A.
 I'm a B.
 He is okay.
 So is she.
 Singing together in harmony.
 He is a B.
 She's a bird.
 Fiddle-dee-dee.
 Yes, you heard.
 We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.

 I am Bjorn. I'm the guy
Who is careful and shy.
Don't like to spend every dime.
But I love my guitar,
And I drive in my car.
 Scares me to death every time.
 And I don't like shave.
 You should live in a cave.
 No, I feel more at home on thew stage.
When I sing and I play
With my group, it's okay.
 Your group?! You're kidding! Or is it your age?

 I am an A.
 I'm a B.
 He is okay.
 So is she.
 Singing together in harmony.
 He is a B.
 She's a bird.
 Fiddle-dee-dee.
 Yes, you heard.
 We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.
Two and two together make four.
Every song opens a door.
 I am an A.
 I am a B.
 I am a B.
 I am an A.

 I'm Agnetha. hello.
I'm the young one, you know.
 She never lets me forget.
 I am gentle and mild.
Underneath it, I'm wild.
 Craziest woman I've met.
 I'm romantic, they say,
But it's not quite that way.
I'm down to earth, yes indeed.
And I like early nights, so I turn off the lights.
 And I never get any chances to read.

 I am an A.
 I'm a B.
 He is okay.
 So is she.
 Singing together in harmony.
 He is a B.
 She's a bird.
 Fiddle-dee-dee.
 Yes, you heard.
 We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.

 I am Benny, at last.
And I'm living quite fast.
I like to travel and see.
I can play in "the mood".
I like wine. I like food.
 Now, that's somthing He just can't deny.
I can play day and night,
If the feeling's alright.
 And that's somehimes a problem for me.

 I am an A.
 I'm a B.
 He is okay.
 So is she.
 Singing together in harmony.
 He is a B.
 She's a bird.
 Fiddle-dee-dee.
 Yes, you heard.
 We are a simple, four-letter word:
A-B-B-A.
