Here's to us
One more toast
And then we'll pay the bill
Deep inside both of us
Can feel the autumn chill

Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over
And the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

In our lives we have walked
Some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified
And not too old for sex

We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love
And thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame
When all is said and done

It's so strange, when you're down
And lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head
Get up and ask for more

Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads
No desire to run
There's no hurry anymore
When all is said and done
