Everybody screamed,
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed,
When I kissed the teacher

All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush,
He looked like a fool
Nearly petrified
'Cause he was taken by surprise

When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes,
When I kissed the teacher

My whole class went wild
As I held my breath,
The world stood still,
But then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven,
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care,
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance,
When I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance,
When I kissed the teacher

Leaning over me,
He was trying to explain
The laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it,
I just had to kiss the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care,
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day,
When I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away,
When I kissed the teacher

My whole class went wild
As I held my breath,
The world stood still,
But then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven,
When I kissed the teacher

(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
