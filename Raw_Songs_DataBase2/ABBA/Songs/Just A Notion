Just a notion, that's all
Just a funny feeling deep inside (A-ha-ha)
That you're out there waiting
You're not sure I'm alone
And you wonder if I'm occupied (A-ha-ha)
So you're hesitating

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from thereon must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
There's something happening that I just can't explain
If I try it's all in vain because it's

Just a notion, that's all
Just a feeling that you're watching me (A-ha-ha)
Every move I'm making
Am I reading your mind?
'Cause it's almost like you're touching me (A-ha-ha)
There is no mistaking

Just a notion
That you'll be walking up to me
In a while and you'll smile and say hello
And we'll be dancing through the night
Knowing everything from thereon must be right

Just a notion
But somehow I know I'm not wrong
If it's our destiny, there's nothing we can do
And tonight is very special
It's a night for me and you

(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
I, I think it's more than a notion (A-ha-ha)
Give me more than you're dreaming, step up to the truth
(A-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
(A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
