I know that this shouldn't be
A traumatic event, but it is
And I feel so bad
My little boy looks so happy
He throws me his "go-mummy" kiss
And he loves his dad
And I've loved him too
Maybe I still do
But, it's over

Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back at on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan

Certain that I'm out of sight
I pull over and turn off the car
And I bang the wheel
I can't believe that I've actually
Held it together this far
Seeing how I feel
But I said good-bye
And I did not cry
Though my heart ached

Keep an eye on Dan
Promise me you can
He gets out of hand if you let him
So keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back at seven on Sunday to get him

I, I think he must have lost some weight
Funny how it takes me back to our first date

So keep an eye on Dan

Keep an eye on Dan
You're a loving man
Make an effort not to upset him
Just keep an eye on Dan
And don't forget
I'll be back on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan
