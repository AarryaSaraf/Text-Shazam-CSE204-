Album: Arrival

// When I Kissed The Teacher //

Everybody screamed,
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed,
When I kissed the teacher

All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush,
He looked like a fool
Nearly petrified
'Cause he was taken by surprise

When I kissed the teacher
Couldn't quite believe his eyes,
When I kissed the teacher

My whole class went wild
As I held my breath,
The world stood still,
But then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven,
When I kissed the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care,
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

I was in a trance,
When I kissed the teacher
Suddenly I took the chance,
When I kissed the teacher

Leaning over me,
He was trying to explain
The laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it,
I just had to kiss the teacher

One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care,
Gonna teach him a lesson alright

What a crazy day,
When I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away,
When I kissed the teacher

My whole class went wild
As I held my breath,
The world stood still,
But then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven,
When I kissed the teacher

(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him)
When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him)

// Dancing Queen //

Ooh, you can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine
Oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

Digging the dancing queen

// My Love My Life //

I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely
(Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

I've watched you look away
Tell me is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

Like an image passing by, my love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
(See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely
(Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Yes I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

// Dum Dum Diddle //

I can hear how you work, practising hard
Playing night and day, woah-oh
And it sounds better now
Yes, you improve every time you play, woah-oh
But it's bad
You're so sad
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum-dum-diddle, your darling fiddle
But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind, woah-oh
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind, woah-oh
You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum-dum-diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum-dum-diddle, your darling fiddle

// Knowing Me Knowing You //

No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're through
This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)
They'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always)
In these old familiar rooms children would play 
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're through
This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know but I have to go
(I have to go this time
I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

[repeat]

// Money Money Money //

I work all night, I work all day
To pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
That's too bad

In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world

Aha-aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world

Aha-aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world

Aha-aha
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

It's a rich man's world

// That's Me //

Are you sure you wanna hear more 
What if I ain't worth the while 
Not the style you'd be lookin' for 
If I'm sweet tonight 
Things look different in the morning light 
I'm jealous and I'm proud 
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud 
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry 
That's me

Are you sure you wanna hear more 
Would I be the one you seek 
Mild and meek like the girl next door 
Don't you realise 
I may be an angel in disguise 
It's lonely to be free 
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be 
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry 
That's me 

I don't believe in fairy-tales 
Sweet nothings in my ear 
But I do believe in sympathy 
That's me, you see 

Are you sure you wanna hear more 
Won't you have a drink with me 
Just to see you're not really sore 
I can't help my ways 
I'm just not the girl to hide my face 
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry 
That's me 

There's a special love 
Like an eagle flying with a dove 
I'll find it in the end 
If I keep on searchin', but until then 
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry 
That's me

// Why Did It Have To Be Me //

When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw them away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

// Tiger //

The city is a jungle. You'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison. You'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me!

I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me
Never come near me
I am the tiger
And if I meet you
What if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you
I always find you
I am the tiger
Tiger!
(Tiger!)
Tiger!

// Fernando //

Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando...

// Happy Hawaii //

Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, we're going to happy Hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance

Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii

It's so exciting, why should I pretend
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii

After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm

I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Somebody's waiting and I'll forget you
Hey Honolulu, we're going to happy Hawaii
