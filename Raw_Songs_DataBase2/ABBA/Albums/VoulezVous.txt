Album: VoulezVous

// As Good As New //

I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta have you near

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near

I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again

As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
Darling, we were always meant to stay together

// Voulez-Vous //

People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

Looking mighty proud

// I Have A Dream //

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream

// Angeleyes //

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
I keep thinking, a-aaah

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angeleyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes
Angeleyes
Once he took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no no no no

Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah
Ah-ha-ha, ah-aaaah

Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah
Keep thinking 'bout his angeleyes
Ah-ha-ha, keep thinking, ah-aaaah
Keep thinking, I had to pay the price

// The King Has Lost His Crown //

I believe your new girl turned you down 
And they say she's pushing you around 
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride 
Tell me my friend how many nights you cried 

Disaster and disgrace 
The king has lost his crown 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Aaaaah 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown 

Was it hard to step down from your throne 
And to know tonight you're all alone 
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl 
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her 

Disaster and disgrace 
The king has lost his crown 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Ha-aaaahh 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown 

Disaster and disgrace 
The word is all around 
Suddenly 
He's clumsy like a clown 
Aaaaaaa-ah 
The world is upside down 
The king has lost his crown

// Does Your Mother Know //

You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe...

// If It Wasn't For The Nights //

I got appointments, work I have to do
Keeping me so busy all the day through
They're the things that keep me from thinking of you
Ohhh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say
And I lose my temper ten times a day
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

No one to turn to, you know how it is
I was not prepared for something like this
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss
Ohhh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it
I got my business to help me through the day
People I must write to, bills I must pay
But everything's so different when night's on its way
It's bad, oh, so bad

Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall
Sitting here alone and staring at the wall
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)
if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)
If it wasn't for the nights
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)

Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights

// Chiquitita //

Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you

Claiming that love's a longevity factor

// Kisses Of Fire //

Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong
Losing you is a nightmare fate and to me it's new
Never before did you see me begging for more

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
Kisses of fire
Kisses of fire

Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
(I'm at the point of no returning)
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)
Kisses of fire, burning, burning
I'm at the point of no returning
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions
Caught in a land-slide of emotions

// Lovelight //

I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

How I remember the first time we went to the movies
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight

And I feel so good
And I feel so right
And I know that you must have a lovelight
You've got lovelight
And I can feel your love everywhere
Maybe even when you're not there
You've got lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night
I won't let you out of my sight
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
Everything about you is right
Let it glow and let it be bright
I don't want to lose your lovelight
Shining like a star in the night

// Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) //

Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight...

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
