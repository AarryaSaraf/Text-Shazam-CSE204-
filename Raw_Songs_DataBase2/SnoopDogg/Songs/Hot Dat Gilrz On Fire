Ladies and gentlemen, I am very honored to present to you
One of the flyest players of all time
My man, Soopafly, go hard on 'em

I said "Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire"
I'm 'bout to get you up out of that attire
Soopa' get by, but I'm not no buyer
I'll give you somethin' else that'll get you higher
Fire, but I'm not Richard Pryor
It's a thing that a bitch admire, check it out
Peep close, baby hot with a deep throat
Navy ho', dong long, with a peacoat
Made me slow, down when that bitch looked around me
Chocolate stepped in, bitch called a brownie
Hoes work together, then the flame got hotter
Stuck out my wand, like my name is Harry Potter
Swing, Soopa' hit 'em off in their hot spot
Stroked up and down the pussy, with Pop-pop
No cock blockin', ridin' like I'm Tupac
Bust a nut, drip, drip down, like a dude drop
It's that nigga, always into somethin'
Plumpin', six years old, I was humpin', like I'm Bobby
I'ma bust a bitch in the lobby
Money is my pro fest, a ho' is my hobby

Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
If that's not the truth, then I'm a liar
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Here I hold somethin' that a bitch admire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
I need to get sucked up, 'til I retire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Have her get low, I'ma get you higher
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire

Got the green, like jumped in, call me chimney
Pussy on fire, like the bitch was a chimney
Play the music low, put the lights on, dimly
Ten hoes, standin' all around, like an assembly
Fucked me up, 'til my thing got soft
Tried to put them clothes on, now they back off
Keep on pumpin', baby, don't slack off
Fuck them other bitches, let them hoes jack off
I'm ridin' in that tutu, in that BP
Keep fuckin' with a nigga, pretty soon, skeet-skeet
Window to the wall, indoor with some hypnotic
Hit the chronic, after that, a bitch got it
I'm like a don, better yet, a cold vet
Moet on the bitch
Get her more wet, bone the bitch
Get her whole check, own the bitch
Never give a bitch up for sex, loan that bitch

Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
If that's not the truth, then I'm a liar
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Here I hold somethin' that a bitch admire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
I need to get sucked up, 'til I retire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Have her get low, I'ma get you higher
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
Ooh, hot, that girl's on fire
