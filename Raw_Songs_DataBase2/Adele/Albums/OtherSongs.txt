// Baby It's You //

Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

How many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
(Sha la la la la)

You should hear what they say about you
(Cheat, cheat)
(Sha la la la la)
They say you never, never, never ever been true
(Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do when it's true

Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Yeah, oh

How many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you

// Black & Gold //

If fish swam out of the ocean
And grew legs and they started walking
And the apes climbed down from the trees
And grew tall and they started talking
And the stars fell out of the sky
And my tears rolled into the ocean
Now I'm looking for a reason why
You even set my world into motion

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold

Oh oh oh oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I looked up into the grey sky
And see a thousand eyes staring back
And all around these golden beacons
I see nothing but black
I feel a way of something beyond them
I don't see what I can feel
If vision is the only validation
Then most of my life isn't real

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Black and gold
Oh

'Cause if you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
Now I'm filled to the top with fear
But it's all just a bunch of matter
'Cause if you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold

If you're not really here
Then I don't want to be either
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold
Black and gold

// Don't You Remember (Live at Largo) //

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye.
Not a single word was said,
No final kiss to seal any sins.
I had no idea of the state we were in.

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong.
The more I do, the less I know.

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head.

But don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember me once more.

Gave you the space so you could breathe,
I kept my distance so you would be free,
And hoped that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me.

Why don't you remember,
Don't you remember
The reason you loved me before?
Baby, please remember you used to love me.

When will I see you again?

// Fastlove //

Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right

But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh...

In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I... I miss my baby

// I Can't Make You Love Me //

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me closely
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I will feel the power but you won't
No you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't
Yeah-hh

I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're home with me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power but you won't
No you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't

// Keep Burning //

Better know that summer is over
I'm not gonna tell if you don't 
Rather wear the sea on my shoulders
Than trust my old umbrella and junk

As the pavement sinks
Autumn rings
Feel my limb 
Heart than sing

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep

Callin' for the winner coke find me
Ship me back to Florence tonight
Draggin' all my mirrors behind me
Which I will never get back inside

Where the lava lies
Watch it rise
Keep my eyes
Hypnotize 

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep

Volcano speak
I'm erupting 
My ground is turning, I keep burning everything 
Volcano please
You're my disease
My core is a aching, I can't shake him out of me
Go back to sleep

// Last Nite //

Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door

Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Ehole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles

But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cause I left that night
Yeah

Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah

// Never Gonna Leave You //

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling so brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm sure of falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt devil, almost fall apart then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is seizing us

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave no
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no

// Promise This //

In the beginning there was nothing
So empty in the space between
And you came in, turned the lights on
And created what is come to be

Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Déployer les ailés

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette
Plumerai les ailés

Though I'm walking through the shadows
You were with me and you comfort me
Lay me down now, time for sleeping
But before that, would you raise on me?

Before I pluck your wings, cover me
Please spread your wings, cover me and

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

By a thread we're hanging on
And I hope you don't let go
If you ever leave me
Know I wanna go with you

Promise this if I die before I wake up
Promise this, take the time to say your grace
On your knees you'll pray for me
Promise this, be the last to kiss my lips

Alouette, -uette, -uette

Alouette, -uette, -uette
Alouette, -uette, -uette

Alouette, déployer les ailés
Alouette, déployer les ailés

// Skyfall //

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
That skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall

[x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together

Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall
Oh-s...

// You'll Never See Me Again //

In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said

At the dawning of the day
I can't bear to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

At the dawning of the day
I can't bear to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you now
It's taken all of my strength
But I'm stronger now

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
