// You Took My Heart //

I don't want to think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart

I took my time, just to find out where your head is at
I guess you don't need my lovin'
But baby, I can understand all of that
It may sound funny, it may sound strange, coming like this
It may sound funny, baby, all because I changed my twist
Ah, it's time for some real good lovin'
And do you think it's time for your good lovin', baby
Ooh, ooh baby, baby, baby

I don't wanna think that you don't want me (Say it to me, baby)
I just want to say that you took my heart (Don't fool with it)
I don't want to think that you don't want me
I just want to say that you took my heart

No, no, don't fool me, baby
Just wanna say that you took my heart
Do you think it's time for some real, real good lovin'?
And do you think it's time for your real, real, real good huggin'?

I don't wanna think that you don't want me (Baby, baby)
I just wanna say that you took my heart (Ah-ha, baby)
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart

// I Refuse To Lose //

1, 2, 3, take it down
Alright
Hard times, hard times
Oh, ain't got no money to pay my bills
Wanna have some fun, keep my lovin' still
I refuse to lose, oh, I refuse to lose

Need more lovin', I need it bad
Recall the good times I used to have
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
Take it up, I refuse to lose
Said I refuse to lose, get down

Looka here now, Ali said, I feel like Ali
I said I sting like butterfly and float like a bee
Don't want nobody to bother me 'cause I refuse to lose
Oh, I refuse to lose
Said I refuse to lose, oh yeah, I refuse to lose
Get down

Oh yeah
In the pocket, sock it in the pocket
In the pocket, yeah, sock it in the pocket
In the pocket, say it now, sock it in the pocket
And let the good times roll, and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha ha, and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha, and let the good times roll
Do the muscle
Get it in the pocket and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha ha, and let the good times roll
Rock it in the pocket, ha, and let the good times roll
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll, ha
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll
Hit it again, ow...

I miss that I need to have
I miss my girl and I need her bad
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
Times are rough and money's short
I lost the things that I thought I bought
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
I refuse to lose, said I refuse to lose
I refuse to lose, said I refuse to lose
Get down, get down

Hey, uh, good God
Sock it in the pocket, St. Pinck, get in the pocket, Pinck
Sock it in the pocket, you did it
Make it squeal, Pinck
Make it super bad
Come on and party
Do the muscle man, bus stop, ha, get down
Sock it in the pocket, get in the pocket
Sock it in the pocket, get in the pocket
Need it in the pocket, need it in the pocket
Get it in the pocket, sock it in the pocket
Sock it in the pocket, get it in the pocket
Hey...hit it!

Oh yeah, I refuse to lose
Oh, I refuse to lose, woo, oh yeah
Said I refuse to lose, ah-ha-ha-ha
I refuse to lose, woo, so good, so good, so good
I refuse to lose
Wait a minute
I had my fun, smart as I can be, ah-ha-ha
I had my fun, smart as I can be
Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
Ali said he refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
The boy said, that I refuse to lose
My woman said she refuse to lose
James Brown said he refuse to lose
I refuse to lose
Elvis Presley said, ha, said I refuse to lose
Shake that thang, shake that thang
