// Bewildered //

Bewildered, lost in a dream
In the love I need why did we part
Bewildered, has love, has love died dear
Wishing your heart could feel, what's in my heart

Must I have sleepless night and endless days
Oh love why did you keep my soul
Without a spark, I'm in the dark

Bewildered, I need your, I need your
I need your guiding hand
I'll never, no I'll never understand

How you can love me, how you can love me
How you can love me, how you can love me
How you can love me and leave me
Bewildered, bewildered

// I Don't Mind //

I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one
You're thinking of

But I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

I don't mind
Your body and soul
I don't mind your
Love growing cold

But I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

I don't mind
This is my song
I don't mind
Goodbye, so long

I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

Yeah
I know, I know
I know, know, know
Know, know, know, know

// In The Wee Wee Hours (Of The Nite) //

Just hold me in your arms
That's where I belong
In your arms, that's where I belong

In the wee wee hours of the night
That's when our love get real tight
I don't wanna be wrong
No, but tell me, you got to be right

Hey, I said love is a many splendored thing
With all the happiness it brings
In the wee hours of the night
That's when our love get real tight
I don't wanna be wrong
No, then tell me you gotta be right, no no

Hey, I said love is a many splendored thing
With all the happiness it brings

// It's A Man's, Man's, Man's World //

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the train
To carry the heavy load
Man made the electrolight
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water
Like Noah made The Ark

This is a man's, man's, man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Man thinks about a little bit of baby girls and of baby boys
Man make them happy
'Cause man make them toys
And after man make everything
Everything he can
You know that man makes money
To buy from other man

This is a man's world
But it would be nothing, nothing
Not one little thing
Without a woman or a girl

He's lost in the wilderness
He's lost in bitterness

// Is It Yes Or Is It No? //

Is it yes, is it no 
Did you ever, making me cry 
Did you ever, making me die 
Was it fun, making me suffer 
Was it fun, making me suffer 
Now is your answer ves ro is it no 

Is it yes or no 

I remember when you went home 
'Cause you left me you'll all alone 
Now was it fun when you said you weren't 
the one 
Was it fun now when he made his little run 
Oh know on the 
Is it yes or Lorg is it yes 
Or is it no 
Is it yes or no 

Oh yes now you won't be back 
But remember you gave me my little sack 
Now darling you made my life complete 
Lord just thrown me out in the street now 
But I want your answer 
Is it yes, is it yes 
Oh Lord is it no 
Is it yes or no 

Tell me, is it yes 
Or is it no, is it yes

// The Bells //

There are four black horses 
With eyes of flaming red 
Their rovers are tied with ribbing 
All around my baby's head 

The bells are ringing And their sail is going to sea 

Yes I know why they're ringing 
They ring on for me 
Oh yea 

I wish I could see my baby 
This can't happen to me 
No, ... 

Baby please forgive me 
I know I've caused you pain 
I'll place your tears with diamonds 
Just to see your face again 
[Repeat]

Ashes into ashes 
Dust to dust 
Ashes into ashes
