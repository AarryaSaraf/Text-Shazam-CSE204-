// Come Rain Or Come Shine //

I'm gonna love you like no one can loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess, when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't, don't ever bet me, baby
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like no one can love me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't you be fine, [?] me, baby

Days may be cloudy or sunny
When we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you, rain or shine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
When, when we're out of the money [?] on
But I'm with you always
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you
Please, I'm with you, rain or shine

// Good Rockin' Tonight //

Well, I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight
Well, I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight

I'm gonna hold my baby
As tight as I can
Tonight she'll know
I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight

I say, well, meet me in a hurry
Behind the barn
Don't you be afraid, darling
I'll do you no harm
I want you to bring
Along my rockin' shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away
All my blues
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight

Well, we're gonna rock. We're gonna rock
Let's rock. Come on and rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rockin' tonight
Have you heard the news?
Everybody's rockin' tonight

I'm gonna hold my baby
As tight as I can
Well, tonight she'll know
I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight

Well, we're gonna rock, rock, rock
Come on and rock, rock, rock
Well, rock, rock, rock, rock
Let's rock, rock, rock, rock
We're gonna rock all our blues away

// Nature Boy //

Sometimes I get a little lonely 
And sometimes I get a little blue

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return
Sometimes I get a little, a little, a little lonely 

And sometimes, sometimes I get a little blue
The greatest thing is just to love and be loved in return

// Mona Lisa //

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?
For that Mona Lisa, strangeness in your smile

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there

Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

// I Loves You, Porgy //

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad

If you can keep me
I want to stay with you forever
And I'll be glad

I love you, Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands

If you can keep me
I want to stay with you forever
I like my man

Someday I know he's coming
Back to call me
He's gonna handle me
And hold me so

It's going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes, I know
I'll have to go

// Fever //

Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Listen to me, baby
Hear ev'ry word I say
No one can love you the way I do
Because they don't know how to love you my way
You give me fever baby, when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Bless my soul I love you
Take this ole heart away
And take this arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say
You give me fever a-a, when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call James Brown
I know you gonna love me right
Mmh mmh, baby, mmh...
Oh - no no - oh
My face is wet, my face, my face
My face is wet, yeah, my face is wet...

// Stagger Lee //

The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that"
"You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat"
Stagger Lee started off goin' down that railroad track
He said "I can't get you Billy but don't be here when I come back"

Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four
Said "I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe"
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door
He said "Nobody move" and he pulled his forty-four

Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass

// I Want To Be Around //

I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company-wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine
