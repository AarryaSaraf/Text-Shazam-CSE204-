// You've Got The Power //

I need you darlin'
You've got the power to love
Mmmmm, you've got the power in your hand
You've got the power to make me
Understand
But oh, I want you to try me
You've got the power to love
Oh darlin'

I told you darlin'
That I'll stand by your side
Remember the day
You made me cry
Oh darlin', oh my little darlin'
You've got the power to love

We belong together
And darlin' you know
I don't have to look no further
'Cause

You've got the power
(Yes you have)
In your hand
(Yes you have)
You've got the power
(You've got the power)
To make me understand
(You've got the power)
You've all I need
(You've got the power)
You're all I want baby
(You've got the power)
You're all I want baby
(You've got the power)
I say it one more time
(You've got the power)
Just wanna hear you say it
(You've got the power)
Make me feel so good now
(You've got the power darlin')
Make me feel so nice
(And I need you)
Make me feel
(I need you)
Let me hear you scream one time
(I need you)
A little bit louder baby
(I need you)
Let me hear you hold it one time
(I need you)
A little bit louder...

// Stone Fox //

Your girl is fine as wine
Let me tell you bout my girl
She don't wear down the black rocks
'Cause she's a stone fox

There you are stone fox
You're mighty mighty sharp
When you walk you make me feel
Baby, you don't know what I see

She's a stone, stone fox
Hey, yeah, oh, ah
All right, there you go, stone fox
You know what you know
When you dance all night
When you prance all night
Stone, stone, stone

Just don't tell, good god
Don't matter who you tell or not
Stone fox, all right
You're as bad as you wanna be
I can't stand it when you touch me
You're bad, the baddest thing I've ever seen
God baby, don't be so mean

No, no, all right
Good god I can't stand it baby
Stone fox, all right
Stone fox, good god

One thing I know all right
Put it on the line
Baby, baby, baby you're mine
Hit it
Gotta, gotta, gotta, good
God almighty
Hit it baby

Oh, yessir
A stone fox, there you are
Stone fox, you're mighty mighty sharp
Baby, you're the best
You gotta be walkin' with your micro mini dress
Stone fox, baby

I like the way, the way you twist
I like to see you when you walk
Got to do it like this
...

// I Got The Feelin' //

Uh huh, uh uh
I got the feeling
Baby, baby
I got the feeling

You don't know what you do to me
People are heavy, down in misery

Hey, yeah, all right, ow
Hey, hey, ah, good Lord

I got the feeling, all right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

I got the feeling, baby
Baby, sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
My heart, I'm around the town

I'm level with the ground, baby
I said level with the ground
Well, baby, you treat me
You treat me bad

No, no, I know
No, you don't mean it now
Sometimes, I roam
But I'll be coming back home
Sometimes I seem to be fly
I just don't want you
To say, "Bye, bye"

Hey, baby, uh uh...
Waaah, baby
I got that feeling, baby
I have it, all right

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby

Come on a
Come on now
Oh, oh, oh, oh ...

// Maybe I'll Understand (Part 1) //

I'm broken hearted
It's my fault
Treated my baby wrong
Now I just got to talk
But help me somebody
I'm a man
Help me somebody
L believe she just don't understand
I'm tryin' so hard
Tryin' so hard
I'm tryin' to do the best I can
Oh yes I am

When I, I lay down
I got my baby on my mind
Yes I have
When I, when I lay down
I got my baby on my mind
Oh yeah
I think about the good things
And the good times
The way she made me feel so fine

I said I'm sittin' in the dark
Right now
And I know I don't need no light
Oh yes I, oh yes I. yes I
I'm sittin' all in the dark
I want the world to know
I don't need no light
I don't need no light
'Cause I'm wondcrin'
I'm wondering where she's gone
And I'm wondenn' what
What she's doin' tonight

And all I can say, all I can say
Is help me somebody
Help me understand
Help me somebody
I know that I'm not a man
'Cause I need her to hold my hand
And maybe
Maybe I'll understand...

// If I Ruled The World //

If I ruled the world
Everyday would be like the first day of spring
Every voice would have a new song to sing
Song of joy
Every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Everyman would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word
And we'd treasure each day that occurred
My world is such beautiful place

Where we would seek such a wonderful dream
My world would have a smile on it's face
Like the man in the moon
Where the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Everyman would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man could end
No my friend
When I rule the world
When I rule the world

So hold your head up high
Let the sun shine
In everyone's sky
Each day will never dawn
When I rule the world

// Maybe I'll Undertsand (Part 2) //

That's the reason she wanted me for, a part time love now
She says baby, baby you don't understand
And oh baby, I swear I just can't be your back door man now
Oh no I can't
I said, I said I just can't be
I said I just can't be your back door man
Oh no I won't
I won't sneak and hide baby
I'm a fool
People say I just don't understand
Oh no
I know

Play it one time Jimmy
Oh now
Take it down some
Can't lose these blues
Can't lose these blues

I remember, I remember
A gambler told one time
He said it's so hard
When you're trying to play a black jack game
Oh yes it Is
I had 15 hit him with a 6
You know, you know, he won just the same
Ain't that a sin
If I couldn't hit that 15 I had
Do you know, that would make me win
I guess I'm, I guess I'm, I'm in hard luck

Oh, Oh
Help me somebody
Help me somebody
Oh, help me somebody ...

// It Won't Be Me //

One of these days, you're gonna need somebody
One of these days darlin'
You're gonna be hurt like me
Don't matter how much you try to apologise
You're gonna need somebody
Gonna want somebody baby
Somebody to dry your eyes

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me

One of these days
You're gonna be alone
One of these days darlin'
You're gonna be so blue
You're gonna try to smile
But the hurt won't let you
One of these days baby
You'll need somebody to be true

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me

You came, you saw, conquered me
I was bound by the same love
I worked hard every day
Gave you all my hard earned pay

Go on your way
The time is gonna come for you
Some day

One of these days, you're gonna want someone
Who don't want you
One of these days, you'll be in misery
Some day you'll take a fall I bet you
You'll need, need
It won't be me

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me
