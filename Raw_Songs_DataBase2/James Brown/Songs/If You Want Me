If you want me, you won't hurt me
If you want me, you won't hurt me
If you want me, you won't hurt me, oh
You, if you, if you want me

I know that someday you'll be true
Stop going 'round doing things that you do
If you want me, you won't hurt me
If you, if you, if you want me

If you want me
Oh, you want me
Oh, you want me
