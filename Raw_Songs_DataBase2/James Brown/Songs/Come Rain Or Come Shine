I'm gonna love you like no one can loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess, when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't, don't ever bet me, baby
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like no one can love me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't you be fine,  me, baby

Days may be cloudy or sunny
When we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you, rain or shine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
When, when we're out of the money  on
But I'm with you always
I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you
Please, I'm with you, rain or shine
