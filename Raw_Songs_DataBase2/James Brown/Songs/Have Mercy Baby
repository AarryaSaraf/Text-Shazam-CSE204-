Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong

My heart is full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

Been reaping all all my sorrow
I don't know what to do

Lord, have mercy, baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong

Been reaping all all my sorrow
Take me back where I belong
Oh, yeah, yeah

So, have mercy, mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong
Oh, have mercy, baby
I know I done you wrong

But my heart is full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

Been reaping all all my sorrow
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
