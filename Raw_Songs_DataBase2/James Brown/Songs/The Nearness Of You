It's not the pale moonlight that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

And oh, it isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no, darlin'
It's just the nearness of you, of you

When you're in my arms
I feel you so close to me
And all my wildest dreams
Don't you know darlin'?
They come true, oh yes, they do

It's not, it's not the pale moonlight that excites me
Darling, that thrills and delights me, oh no, no, no, no, no
It's just the nearness of you

No, no, no, darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', no darlin'
Oh darlin', it's just the nearness of you
When you're close to me
I feel, I feel that, that one, one sensation
