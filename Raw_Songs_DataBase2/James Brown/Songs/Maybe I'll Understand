I'm brokenhearted, it's my fault
Treated my baby wrong, and I just got to talk
But help me, somebody, I'm a man
Help me, somebody, I believe she just don't understand
I'm trying so hard, trying so hard
I'm trying to do the best I can, oh yes I am

When I, I lay down
I got my baby on my mind, oh yes I have
When I, when I lay down
I got my baby on my mind, oh yeah
I'll think about the good things, and the good times
The way she make me feel so fine

Mmm, I said I'm sitting in the dark, oh now
And I don't, I don't need no light
Oh yes I am, oh yes I am, yes I...
I'm sitting alone in the dark
I want the world to know I don't need no light
I need no light
'Cause I'm wondering, I'm wondering where she's gone
And I'm wondering what, what she's doing tonight
And all I can say, all I can say is
Help me, somebody, help me understand
Help me, somebody, I know that I'm not her man
'Cause I need her, to hold my hand
Then maybe, maybe I'll understand

That's the reason she wanted me for her part-time love now
She says, "Baby, baby, you don't understand"
AND OH, baby, I swear I just can't be
I can't be, I can't be your back-door man now, oh, no, I can't
I said, I said I just can't be
I said I can't be your back-door man, oh no I won't
I won't sneak and hide, baby
I'm a fool, people say, I just don't understand, oh no, oh no
Play it one time, Jimmy, oh now

[Jimmy Nolen guitar solo]

Take it down some
Can't lose these blues
Mmm...can't lose these blues
I remember, I remember, my grandma told me one time
She said it's so hard, when you're trying to play a Blackjack game
Oh yes it is
I had 15, hit him with a 6
You know, you know, you know he wasn't just the same
Ain't that a sin?
If I could've hit that 15 I had
Do you know that would make me win?
I guess I'm, I guess I'm, I'm in hard luck
And OH, and OH...help me, somebody, hey
Help me, somebody, OH, help me, somebody
Help me, somebody, OH...
