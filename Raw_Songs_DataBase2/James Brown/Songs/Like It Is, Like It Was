New York City's alright, but I wanna go home
Let me tell you, I wanna go home
Is it alright if a man need to go home?
I don't believe you understand me, I wanna go home
Let me be proud of where I came from when I go home
I know he wanna go home
I know he wanna go home
Hey hey, let me go home
Let me go home

I remember Memphis Slim said, feelin' lowdown, act like a clown
I really don't know what to do, what to do
Feelin' so blue, just thinking of you
You didn't think I could do that, did you, fam?
I wonder just where you could be, you could be
Feelin' so blue, just messing around with the blues
With the blues, with the blues, with the blues, with the blues
With the blues

Haha, you know, let me remind you that the fellas
We say we're down and out in New York City
We're down and out in New York City...


So long, oh, I hate to see you go
So long, oh, I hate to see you go
