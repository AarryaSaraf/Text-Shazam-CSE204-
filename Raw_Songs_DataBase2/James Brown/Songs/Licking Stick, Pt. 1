Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick 
Bring me that licking stick 
Bring me that licking stick 
Bring me that licking stick 


People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag

Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick 
Bring me that licking stick
