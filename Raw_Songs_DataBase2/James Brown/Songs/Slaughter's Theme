You better know it
You better know it
You better know it
Huh

If a hitman don't get you then Slaughter will
Streets don't deal with the funky mind, soon be killed
You better know it, you better know it
Fight for what you think is right, don't give up
Fight it when you know you're right
You sure enough got to pick on him
Either a man with an organization or kind loving slim
You better know it, you better know it, hey
Wait, time for the turnaround, that means change from front to back

Hey hey, it's time for the turnaround, that's change from front to back
Got to do it the new way, keep the people off your back
But when it's time to kill
If the hitman don't get you then Slaughter will
You better know it, wait, let me tell you who Slaughter is
He's a brother who won't answer to Spider, Snake or Sam
Dealin' with his mind...
Deal you can't refuse

Wait! Let me tell you who Slaughter is
Slaughter, ha, he's a brother who won't answer to Spider, Snake or Sam
Dealin' with his mind, brother, don't give a damn
He does what he has to do 'til every man has gone
And nothin', and nothin' left
He fights like hell, keep on livin' and die when he just can't help himself
That's Slaughter
Put that in your pipe and smoke it
Lay it on your funky note then soak it
