I, I, I feel that old feeling coming on
I, I, I feel that old feeling coming on 
I, I've been so unlucky over since I've been born 
Yeah, tell me pretty baby, tell me what you're gonna do 
Yeah, tell me pretty just what you're gonna do 
Yes you're gonna keep on running 
Let your woman make a fool of you 
Yes, I...
I feel, I feel that old feeling coming on 

I've been beautiful pretty baby 
Don't you know I've a scar 
I've been beautiful pretty baby 
Don't you know I've a scar 
I've been thinking about 
That sure hits the bone 
Yes just count all your tinbers 
Can you reach 21 
Yes just keep on counting baby 
You reach 21 
I'm so unlucky 
I'm my mother's seventh son 
Yeah I... 
I feel, I feel that old age coming on
