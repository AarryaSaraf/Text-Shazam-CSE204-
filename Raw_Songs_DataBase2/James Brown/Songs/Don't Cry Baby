Don't cry, baby, don't cry, don't cry, baby
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again

You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you, to treat you so mean
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again
Try me one more time

This could happen to me
My heart and pain

Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, not now
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, baby yeah yeah
Dry your eye, dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again

Gotta tell you one more time
Dry your eye and let's be sweethearts again
Dry your eye and let's, and let's, and let's be sweethearts again
Again, again, no, no, no, no
