Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner

For one command I stand and wait now
From one who's master of my fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner

What's the good of my caring
If someone is sharing those arms
But not with me?
Although she has another
I can't have another for I'm not free

She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Upon my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life, my life, is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner
Don't let me be a prisoner
(Prisoner of love)
You made me a prisoner
(Prisoner of love)
And you made me love you
(Prisoner of love)
Take those shackles of love and go away
(Prisoner of love)
'Cause I love you so much more
(Prisoner of love)
You you you...
