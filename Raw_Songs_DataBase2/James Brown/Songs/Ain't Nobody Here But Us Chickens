One night farmer Brown was takin' the air
And I locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house something stirred
When he shouted, "Who's there?"
This is what he heard

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So calm yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us

We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all

You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground
Kickin' up an awful dust
So point that gun the other way
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, hit the hay

Tomorrow is a busy day
We got ground to dig, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So point that gun the other way
There ain't nobody here but us

We're chickens trying to sleep and you bust in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin
Hey, hey, hey, I gotta poop

Oh, tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
Point that gun the other way
And kick it up an awful fuss

We're chickens trying to sleep and you butt in
And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin

Ain't nobody, nobody here but us chicken now
I gotta tell you all
I wanna give a little soul now
Leave us alone, alone, can't you leave us alone?
And I don't bother nobody
