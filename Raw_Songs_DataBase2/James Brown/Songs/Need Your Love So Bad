I need someone hands to lead me through the night
I need someone arms to hold and squeeze me tight
And when the night begins until it ends
I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lying
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
I need your love so bad

So give it up and bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, plain and simple
So it can be read to me, tell me you love me
And stop driving me mad 'cause I need your love so bad

Oh, darling, I need a soft voice that will talk to me at night
Don't worry, baby, we won't fuss and fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad

So give it up, give it up, darling, bring it home to me
Or write it, write down on paper, plain and simple
So it can be read to me, tell me you love me
And stop driving me mad 'cause I need your love so bad

Oh, I need a soft voice to talk to me at night
Don't worry, baby, we won't fuss and fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad, I need your love so bad, yeah
