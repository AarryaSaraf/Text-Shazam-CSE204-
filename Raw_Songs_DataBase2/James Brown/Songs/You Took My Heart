I don't want to think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart

I took my time, just to find out where your head is at
I guess you don't need my lovin'
But baby, I can understand all of that
It may sound funny, it may sound strange, coming like this
It may sound funny, baby, all because I changed my twist
Ah, it's time for some real good lovin'
And do you think it's time for your good lovin', baby
Ooh, ooh baby, baby, baby

I don't wanna think that you don't want me (Say it to me, baby)
I just want to say that you took my heart (Don't fool with it)
I don't want to think that you don't want me
I just want to say that you took my heart

No, no, don't fool me, baby
Just wanna say that you took my heart
Do you think it's time for some real, real good lovin'?
And do you think it's time for your real, real, real good huggin'?

I don't wanna think that you don't want me (Baby, baby)
I just wanna say that you took my heart (Ah-ha, baby)
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
I don't wanna think that you don't want me
I just wanna say that you took my heart
