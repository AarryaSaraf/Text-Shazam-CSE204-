One of these days, you're gonna need somebody
One of these days darlin'
You're gonna be hurt like me
Don't matter how much you try to apologise
You're gonna need somebody
Gonna want somebody baby
Somebody to dry your eyes

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me

One of these days
You're gonna be alone
One of these days darlin'
You're gonna be so blue
You're gonna try to smile
But the hurt won't let you
One of these days baby
You'll need somebody to be true

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me

You came, you saw, conquered me
I was bound by the same love
I worked hard every day
Gave you all my hard earned pay

Go on your way
The time is gonna come for you
Some day

One of these days, you're gonna want someone
Who don't want you
One of these days, you'll be in misery
Some day you'll take a fall I bet you
You'll need, need
It won't be me

It won't be me
No, no, no, it won't be me
It won't be me
It won't be me
