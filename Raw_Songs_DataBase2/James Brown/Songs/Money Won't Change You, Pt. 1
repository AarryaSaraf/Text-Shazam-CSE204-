Told me, darling, that you had to go
Done take your money, I don't care no more
I know you're happy, try to get along

Money won't change you
Money won't change you
Money won't change you
But time will take you on
Lookie here

If everybody had once been hurt
Then you know how it mean to be treated like dirt
Go ahead, baby, tell the world
That you're my woman and my only girl

Money won't change you
Money won't change you
I said, "Money won't change you
But time will take you on"

I  you're happy

And now you're gone

Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
Money won't change you
I said, "Money won't change you
But time will take you on"

Lookie here, lookie here
Look here

I said, "One time, one time"
Oh, yeah, hold out, hold out
Hold out, hold it, slow it down, hold on

Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it

Get on up, get on up
Get on up, get on up
Come on, baby
Come on, baby

Everybody stand up
Everybody stand up
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
