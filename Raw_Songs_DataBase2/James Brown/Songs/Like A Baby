You gave me love, a joy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
Oh yes I am
I'm just a flirt, prepared to be hurt like a baby
Oh yes I am

Oh, I cried, and I cried
And oh, I wouldn't be satisfied like a baby
I love you so much
I wanna feel your tender touch, like a baby
Oh yes I am

Oh oh, oh oh, I...
Oh oh, oh oh, I...

Oh, I cry, and I cry
And oh, I can't be satisfied like a baby
Oh yes I am
I'm just a flirt, prepared to be hurt like a baby
Oh yes I am

Oh oh, oh oh, I...
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, I...

Just like a baby
I'm just like a baby
I'm just like a baby
Just like a baby
Just like a baby
