I know you're happy
I know you're happy
And now you're gone

Money won't change you
Money won't change you, mama
Money won't change you
I said, money won't change you
But time will take you on
Looka here, looka here
Look here

I said, with a smile as good as gold
With a smile now that can't be sold
You said, baby, that you had to go
Go fetch somebody, I don't care no more
Tell your friends I was a fool
The troubled woman, you got to go to school
And a lover from way back home
I had my ball which will never turn off
Dance in the street, in the car, too
Mashed Potatoes and I Boogaloo
Come on, baby, and let yourself go
Come on, baby, and let yourself go
Come on, baby, and let yourself go, ha ha
Fetch somebody, I don't care no more

Come on, baby
Come on, baby

Everybody stand up
Everybody stand up
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Raise your hands
Let me tell you that I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long
