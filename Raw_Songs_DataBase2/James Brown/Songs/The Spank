Put your hand on your hip
And let your backbone slip
The Spank
Put your hand on your hip
And let your backbone slip
The Spank
Put your hand on your hip
And let your backbone slip
The Spank

Tell 'em again
Get yourself 
Do your do

The Spank
Say it again

Walk accross the floor

Say it again
The Spank

And let your backbone slip
