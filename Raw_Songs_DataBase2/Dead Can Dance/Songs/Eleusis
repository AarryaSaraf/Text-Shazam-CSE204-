Oh come calmly
Over the ocean I beckon to thee
I blow seeds of love to be
Born of my heart
Sown on the breeze

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home

The love you hide inside
Has nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
I can see it in your eyes
Your empty hearts and your wasted lives

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home
