// Nothing But Love //

Mash it up now
That's exactly what we gonna do
Make it good

You are so beautiful
You are so wonderful
And you can make your dreams
Make them come true

You get through everything
And cast a laugh and sing
You can do anything
That you want to

You bring the sunshine when it's dark
With nothing but love sweet love
And make me smile and say it's fine
When I haven't got a dime
Love, true love
And when things are going wrong
We can fix it with a song
I know we can now

We gonna do it

You don't need expensive furs
You don't need no diamonds and pearls
You don't need that witchcraft world
To make your dreams come true

You don't need no Cadillac car
You don't have to be no movie star
Just what you are
And I know that you make it through

You are the essence of
Everything I love
Oh baby oh baby

It's a positive vibration
Going in circulation
We gonna give it to the nation
Through this evaporation

I feel it deep, deep down inside

// Oh Bumbo Klaat //

[Chorus:]
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat

I said I came upon this land
To guide and teach my fellow man
But one thing I can't overstand
Is why them don't love his brother man

[Chorus]

Sometimes I sit and look around
And listen to the daily sound
But when I check, there's so much lies
And that's the reason why the children cry

[Chorus]

It's been so long, we need a change
So the shitstem we got to rearrange
And if there's obstacles in the road,
We got to throw them overboard

[Chorus]

One night, an evil spirit held me down
I could not make one single sound
Jah told me, 'Son, use the word'
And now I'm as free as a bird

[Chorus]

// Wanted Dread And Alive //

[Chorus:]
Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
By the evil forces
Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
Nowhere to hide
They are trying to find me

Babylon charge I for ganja
Which I know couldn't do
How could one man Gang Jah
Must be an ape from the zoo

[Chorus]

I've been accused for a shootin'
Which I know never do
Who dem in prison that willing dey
So I've got to pull my way through

[Chorus]

Yesterday was court day
And I-Man forget to go
Today my name is in my papers
And next warrant they will show

[Chorus]

Now I've got to
Judge two guns
To protect myself from men
'Cause I've never done nothin' wrong
And I hate traveling scared

[Chorus]

// Guide Me From My Friends //

Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Everytime I know...
I know my enemies...

They will come and
Sit round your table
Wanting to kill you like
Cain kill Abel

Only trying to find an easy way
That they can try to eliminate you

Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Everytime I know my enemies...

Anytime you see your friend there
The first thing you see
Is him teeth, yes
But if you could see the inner part
Then we gonna know the sucker have got a wicked heart

May Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know, everyday...
I know my enemies...
Said I know my enemies...

Oh Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Long time I been watching them, I know...
I know my enemies...

Your enemies stay far from you
And they don't...
They don't want to see you
While your friends will come
with a smiling face
And it don't mean another shoe's lace...

So Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know my enemies...
Everyday I know...
Oh my enemies...

Jah Jah guide me from my friends...
I know, I know, I know them, I know them...

// Fools Die (For Want Of Wisdom) //

The lips of the righteous teaches many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in the city

Vexation of the soul is vanity
Destruction of the poor is their poverty
The poor man's wealth is in a holy place

Why do you fight each other?
Why do you kill your brother?
Then your reward will be the cemetery

We got to build a better nation
Clean up, clean up Jah creation
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

// The Poor Man Feel It //

[Chorus:]
Gotta find a solution to this pollution [x4]
The poor man a feel it [x4]

Gas gone up
Bus fare gone up
The rent gone up
For meal gone up?
Lighting gone up
The tax gone up
Car parts gone up
And mi can't take the first law

[Chorus]

Only him feel it - yeah

Time gone up
Scallion gone up
Onion gone up
Red beans gone up
Black pepper gone up
Chicken gone up
And the parents them angry
Cause the pickney them hungry

[Chorus]

// Cold Blood //

Every time I see Babylon my blood runs cold
Every time I see the wicked men my belly moves

You say after me sir
I solemnly swear
That the evidence I shall give
Shall be the truth
The whole truth
And nothin but the truth

So help me God
So help I Jah [3x] ..Rastafari
Every time I see the wicked men my belly moves

You are brought before this court
For having ganja in your possession
Guilty or not guilty
Not guilty your honor

How could one man do such a thing ...Gang Jah
It is totally impossible your honor

I can remember yeah
When I was framed and jailed, brutalized
The grudge would find me guilty
For an exhibit they could not find

Every time I see Babylon my blood runs cold
Every time I see the wicked men my belly moves

When I see the condition
I said it's a curse
For the past 400 years ago
Things get from bad to worse

Every time I see Babylon my blood runs cold
Every time I see the wicked men my belly moves

// That's What They Will Do //

[Chorus:]
That's what your friends will do
That's what they will do

They will come with great pretense
To gain your confidence
They'll take you round the bend
And fry you in the end

[Chorus]

They will look right inna you eyes
And tell you the wickedest lies
Make you promises
But never accomplishes

[Chorus]

They will dress up inna you clothes
And punch you inna you nose
Dress up inna you shoes
And still carry false news

[Chorus]

They will know that you in jail
And never try to get you bail
And know that you in trouble
And try to make it double

[Chorus]

They will steal you only goat
And then them cutting throat
If you ever robbed
Woulda come back for you car
