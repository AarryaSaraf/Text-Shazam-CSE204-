Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teaching the people who don't overstan'
And even though I've tried my bes'
I still don't find no happiness

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east
Some goin' west
Some step aside to try their best
Some livin' big
But the most livin' small
They just can't even find
No food at all

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train I'm leaving...
