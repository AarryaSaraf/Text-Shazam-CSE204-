Lift up thine head, o ye black dignity
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-loving black dignity
And let the King of kings enter thine heart

For in a little while and the wicked shall not be
They shall be cut off like the grass
And wither like the green herb
So trust in the Lord and do good
And wait patiently for Him
And verily thou shalt prevail, Selah

I branches shall not wither
And whatsoever I do shall prosper
I shall be like a tree, planted by the rivers
That bringeth forth fruit in season, Selah

So lift up thine head, o ye black people
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-loving black people
And the King of kings shall come in, Selah
Wake up thine slumbering mentality
Come closer to reality

Recognize thy dignity, thy integrity, thy quality
Fret not because of one who prospereth in his way
For in a little while
The evil-doers shall be killed crum  paralyzed
Love Him and live, hate Him and die

Lift up thine head, ye ever-loving black people
And be ye lifted up, ye ever-living black people
And the Lord, God shall come into thine heart
Seek Him and ye shall find Him 'cause He can be found
Wake up thine slumbering mentality and live up to reality

Live black, love black, think black
Our God is black
