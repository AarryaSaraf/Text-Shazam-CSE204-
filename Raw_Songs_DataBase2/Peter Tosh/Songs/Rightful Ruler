Kings of kings, lords of lords
Conquering lion of the tribe of judah
Elect of god, mighty god
Everliving god, earth's rightul ruler

Blessed be the man that walk'eth not
In the counsel of the ungodly
Nor stand'eth in the ways of sinners
Nor sitt'eth in the seat of the scornful
For I delight is in the law of the lord god, Selassie I
In his laws do I meditate day and night
Therefore I must be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water
And bring'eth forth fruit in due season
I locks also shall not wither
And whatsoever I do'eth shall prosper
The weak heart are not so, oh no!
They are like the chaff that the wind driv'eth away
Therefore no weak heart shall stand in the judgment
Nor no sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the lord god so high
That he know'eth the way of the righteous
And know that the way of the weak heart
Shall crumble, paralyze and burn

Jah Rastafari!
But he delight in earthquake, brimstone and fiyah
To kill, crum

Jah! mighty god! everliving god!

And do away with all weak heart
Conception to my creation continually
And let our righteousness cover this earth
As the waters cover the sea Isaiah 11:9

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord,
As the waters cover the sea.
He reigns from that iwa until this iwa
Hailful I, so high and so mighty

Jah Rastafari!
I am the earth rightful ruler
