I've learned some lessons in my life
Always be careful of mankind
They'll make you promises today
But tomorrow they change their mind

But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people

I'm a truthful man
And I love truthful people
I'm an honest man
And I love honest people

I've learned some lessons in my life
Always be careful of my friends
Money can make friendship end

But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people
I'm an honest man
I love honest people
I'm an intelligent man
And I love intelligent people

I'm an aggressive man
And I love aggressive people
I'm a fire man
And I love the fire people

But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm an intelligent man
And I love intelligent people

I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people
