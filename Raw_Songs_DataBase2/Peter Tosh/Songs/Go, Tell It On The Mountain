Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Who's that yonder dressed in red,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder dressed in red,
Sets my people free?
I'm beggin'

Who's that yonder dressed in red?
Must be the children that Moses led.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Who's there yonder dressed, dressed in white,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder, full dressed in white,
Sets my people free?

I'm beggin'
Who's there yonder dressed in white?
Must be the children of the Israelites.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

Ooh woo woo
Who's there yonder dressed in white,
Sets my people free?
Who's there yonder dressed in white,
Sets my people free?

I'm still beggin'
Who's there yonder dressed in white?
Must be the children of the Israelites.
Go tell it on the mountain,
To set my people free.

I'm beggin
Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.
