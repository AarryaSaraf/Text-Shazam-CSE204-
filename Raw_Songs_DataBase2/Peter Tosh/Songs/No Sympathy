I can't find


No love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me

I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

When I'm in troubles yeah
Only me only me feel the pain
No one good word of advice
From any of my so-called friends



Might as well might as well
I get out of hell
Hell could never be made for me
So I'm gonna search search
'til I'm free

No love no love



I can't find no love
No no sympathy
What kind  of love
They got  for me

They don't love themself
So they can't love no one else




I just can't find  no love
I can't find  no sympathy
I can't find  no love at all
What kind of love 
People got for me

I'm searchin'
