Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
In much confusion as you will see
It was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to merry and a wive of his own
He found a young girl suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
Soon the best cook in the island he found
He went to his papa to make a day
His papa shook his head and to him he say
You can't merry that girl, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

He went to his mama and covered his head
And told his mama what his papa has said
His mama she laughs she said go man go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
