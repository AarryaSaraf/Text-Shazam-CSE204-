Rock with me
Rock with me baby
Roll with me
Come on and roll with me honey
Rock with me
You wanna rock with me baby all night long

I said bless my soul,
I don't know what is wrong with me
I don't wanna go home baby,
Baby can't you see?

Rock with me
You wanna rock with me baby all night long,
All night long

Cause you're the sweetest rocker in town
And I love to see you go 'round
You're the sweetest rocker in town
And I love to see you go 'round

Bless my soul, I don't know what is wrong
Don't wanna go woman
Can't you see?

Rock with me
You better rock with me baby
All night long

You've been rocking me everytime
And you.. you're on my mind
So you better rock with me,
And rock with me baby all night
Yeah, all night long

Cause you're the sweetest rocker in town
And I love to see you go 'round
You're the sweetest rocker I've ever seen
And woman you smile so clean

So you better rock with me
Come on and rock with me baby, baby
Roll, roll with me
Roll with me honey, honey
You better rock with me
Come on and rock with me baby all night long
All night long I said
So bless, bless my little soul 
I wanna rock and roll 
I don't want to go woman, 
Woman can't you see?
