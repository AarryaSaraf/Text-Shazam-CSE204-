Mama Africa
How are you doing Mama
Mama Africa
Long time me no see you Mama

They took me away from you Mama
Long before I was born
They took me away from you Mama
Long before I came on in



There's so many things about you
Wondering where you are
They try their best to hide you Mama
But I search and I find you



In you there's so much beauty
In you there's so much life
In you there's so many kingdoms
To me it's out of sight



You're the maker of gold Mama
You're the maker of diamond
You're the maker of pearls
And the maker of all precious goals



I've been waiting, yearning, looking
Searching to find you
I've been crying, praying hoping
That I may find you Mama



You're my mother Africa
You're my father Africa



I'm proud of you Mama
I love you Mama
I'm proud of you Mama
I love you heavenly
