Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat

I said I came upon this land
To guide and teach my fellow man
But one thing I can't overstand
Is why them don't love his brother man



Sometimes I sit and look around
And listen to the daily sound
But when I check, there's so much lies
And that's the reason why the children cry



It's been so long, we need a change
So the shitstem we got to rearrange
And if there's obstacles in the road,
We got to throw them overboard



One night, an evil spirit held me down
I could not make one single sound
Jah told me, 'Son, use the word'
And now I'm as free as a bird
