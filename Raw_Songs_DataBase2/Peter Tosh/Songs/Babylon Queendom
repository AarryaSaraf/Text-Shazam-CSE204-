Babylon, your queendom is falling
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

Babylon, your queendom is falling (tumbling down)
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

Gimme back mi gold, mi ruby an mi diamond

Babylon, your queendom is falling
and Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

sent I sons & daughters from a far off
I said all those that are called of I name

Babylon, your queendom is falling (tumbling down)
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

I say Babylon, your queendom is falling
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

Gimme back mi Zebra, mi Lion an mi Tiger

Babylon, your queendom is falling (tumbling down)
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

I say Babylon, your queendom is falling
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

Gimme back mi land, mi language and mi culture

Oh yeah

Babylon, your queendom is falling (tumbling down)
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

I say Babylon, your queendom is falling
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling

I said, take back your chink, your roach and mosquito

Babylon, your queendom is falling (tumbling down)
Rahab, Ethiopia is calling...
