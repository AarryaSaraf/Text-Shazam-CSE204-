He was a decent lawfull upright honorary citizen

He deserves respect
Gotta give him respect

Peter Tosh 

He fought for the repressed 
In his music
In his words
He was brutalized
For what he thought was right
For what he thought was true

He was a true prophet
In his music
In his words

He was a rebel 
With a cause
A righteous rastaman

One who did not compromise
To save the world
