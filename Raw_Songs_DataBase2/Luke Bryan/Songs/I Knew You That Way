The secret way long shadows bleed into the night
The desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain
I knew you that way

The way cool mountain waters dance down to the sea
Bound by something strong but still so wild and free
It gives in to the passion of the path it takes
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire
That no one sees but burns all night long with desire
The quiet ease that makes a lover want to stay
I knew you that way

I held you closer than I had a right to hold
But the only thing that time can't take away
Is I knew you that way

The holy way that love knows it should never end
The sacred way that stars got sailors home again
Like teardrops know the words to amazing grace
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
I knew you that way
