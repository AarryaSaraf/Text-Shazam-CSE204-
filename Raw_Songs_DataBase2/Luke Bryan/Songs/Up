Up
Early in the morning wakin' that sun
Up
Fillin' that coffee, crankin' that tractor
Up
Prayin' it rains down on the devil's dust
Them rows come poppin'

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow

Up
Rollin' 'round town in a hand me down old pickup
Pullin' in the driveway pickin' that pretty thang
Up
Just layin' low where heaven and a dirt road touch
Holdin' a cold one

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up

Up
On a Sunday pond bank tearin' that crank bait
Up
Livin' for a Friday, runnin' that scoreboard
Up
Keepin' that faith, waitin' on the day He calls us

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up
