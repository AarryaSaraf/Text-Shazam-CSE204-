That little wrinkle in her smile still drives me crazy
I get a chill on my skin when she whispers "baby"
It don't matter what she's doin' or what she's wearin'
I'm just sittin' there staring

She's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like

The way that second glass of wine gets her talkin'
How her hair on my shoulder keeps me fallin'
When she's messin' with the radio in my truck
Everything she does just tears me up

She's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like

Cuz she's the perfect kinda pretty I like
The way her hair falls down and lands just right
From her head to her toes, man all I know is I can't get enough
I don't know what it is about me that got right here
I just know I'm gonna hold on tight...
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like
Lay here in love with her all night
Cuz she's the perfect kind of pretty I like
