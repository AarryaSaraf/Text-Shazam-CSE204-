I ain't been doing to right,
Since I met her last night,
Some kinda burning breakfast,
Lost at work state of mind,
We're meeting here because,
She mentioned that she loves,
This kind of sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff.
But I'm feeling out of place,
But baby's on the way.



I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy,
My hands are sweating heavy,
Something she's got got me feeling like this,
All I gotta do is play it cool,
And end the night with a kiss,
Hey, hey, baby's on the way.



Ain't gonna try those lines,
Been used so many times,
Like "when you fell from heaven did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile,
Sit back and talk a while,
Pull a few questions from my get to know her better file,
Hey its a real good day,
Cause baby's on the way.



I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy,
My hands are sweating heavy,
Something she's got got me feeling like this,
All I gotta do is play it cool,
And end the night with a kiss,
Hey, hey, baby's on the way.

Oh, yeah yeah.



It's just a simple case of can't wait,
Gonna be great to see her again,
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside,
And in my eyes when she walks in.



Oh, I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy,
My hands are sweating heavy,
Something she's got got me feeling like this,
All I gotta do is play it cool,
And end the night with a kiss,
Hey, hey, baby's on the way.

Hey, yeah, my baby's on the way.
Yeah, yeah, baby's on the way.
