Rocks bang together
Things start blowin' up
Planets all align around a big red sun
Then we're all here
That don't just happen

Two tiny cells collide
Then she feels a kick
Soon the baby cries and your goin' home with him
Then he says daddy
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Crops are in the field
There ain't no rain nowhere
Ground is cracks and dust
The whole town is in despair
Then a farmer prays and the storms roll in
That don't just happen

You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Oh, You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen

Every time we take a deep breath
And every time that the wheels touchdown
Every time we take another step
And have one more day to hang around
Know we didn't get that lucky
Cause that don't just happen
That don't just happen

Someone picked you out
Put you in front of me
In a smoky college bar
The rest is history
That don't just happen
