A boy walks past a window of a glowing, open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, "Sir, I've heard you can build anything"

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make Momma happy, if you could build me a daddy

There's an old Winchester rifle, back home hanging on the wall
He promised me, he'd teach me how to aim
And he said, when I got older, we could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So, here's a little money that I've saved

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make Momma happy, if you could build me a daddy

Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so Mister, I was hoping

You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my momma happy, if you could you build me a daddy

Could you build me a daddy?
