It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But 1 turned to 10 and 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I cant find my keys for all this parkin' lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
'Cause my ex-girlfriend ain't lookin' half bad

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

"Help me up, aw put me back down put me back down"

I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I, I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think its time I call it quits

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yea its time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, cant find my cell phone
Yea my lips all busted and my buzz is gone
Its time to take my drunk ass home

If y'all agree, then sing along
Its time to take, my drunk ass home

"Oh somebody call me a cab, please"
