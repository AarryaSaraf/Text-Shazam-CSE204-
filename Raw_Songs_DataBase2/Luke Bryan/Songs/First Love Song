Ridin' down the road listenin' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said, "Baby this is it,
The one I wanted you to hear.
Don't it sound just like us?"

Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to was
a little "Sweet Home...," "Tuesday's Gone,"
and "Working Man Blues."


This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from-now-on
My first love song

Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love and it woke me up,
made me more aware of somethin' deep inside
Somethin' that I have,
A life I want to share
And I'll rememebr this as long as I live
Every note, every word, every single kiss

This is my first love song
First time I felt the words,
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on,
I just think of you and everything you do
You're my one, my from now on..
My first love song

Baby... 

Yeah baby
My first love song
