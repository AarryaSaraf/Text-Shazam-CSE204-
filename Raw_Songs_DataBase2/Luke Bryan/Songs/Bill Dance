This ain't no lie

Saved all my birthday money up
Put it down on a rod and reel
I got my green and tan Plano loaded up
Permission to fish behind that old sawmill
Momma said, "Watch for snakes"
Daddy said, "Shut the gate"
Brother said, "They're biting on the zoom black and red flake"
Laying in the bed that night
I swear I could barely sleep

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

While other boys were playing ball and knocking heads
I was floating on the Muckalee
While rebel kids were smoking, stealing cigarettes
I was fishing in them cypress trees
Paddle and a Jon Boat, nine pound, no joke
Got him in the net cause I didn't get my line broke
Using every trick in the book Daddy ever taught me

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

There's a lot of heroes out there these days
But if you ask me mine, there's only one name I'll say

Bill Dance, fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From the best damn fisherman the world's ever had
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Bill Dance

Yeah, the sun is just starting to shine up over the treetops
It's gonna be a beautiful day, it's plain to see
