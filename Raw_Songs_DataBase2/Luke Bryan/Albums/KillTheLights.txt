Album: KillTheLights

// Kick The Dust Up //

Kick the dust up
Come on

All week long it's a farming town
They're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Bar downtown, they got a line
Of people waiting out the door
Ten dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ear
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up

Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did
Kick it

We go way out where
There ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up

// Kill The Lights //

High beams, you and me
Little back road, barely see
Right song, radio
Throw it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you, it's just too much

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

We can feel our way through
Let me just hold on to you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Don't it feel right
Until the sunrise
We can just go on what we know

Can't help but wanna want ya
You wanna do this don't ya
Come here, let me pull you closer
You reach over and

Kill the lights, kill the lights
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride, take me high
The yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Skin on skin, don't care where we've been
Pull me in and kill the lights

Kill the lights
Baby you and me, kill the lights
Kill the lights

// Strip It Down //

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Lets whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my T-shirt in the hall

Like a needle finds a groove,
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction,
It's time we made it happen

Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down

I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain't holdin' nothin' these two hands
Until they're holding you again

Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

I don't wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So lets close our eyes

And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down

Strip it down, down, down

// Home Alone Tonight //

(Oh, oh)

What you doing in this place?
Well, I could probably ask you the same thing
Another round, girl. What you think?
If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink

So make it seven on seven
Do you want it on the rocks?
A double shot of heaven
Spilling' off the top

And we'll go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Slow country from a cover band,
I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab.
Girl, we got all night, I've got a bottomless tab
So let's goâ€¦

Shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

It feels too good to let it end right here (I ain't going home alone home tonight)
So let's not let it end, let it end right here (girl, you're going home with me tonight)

So let's go shot for shot for shot 'til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock that's gonna stop a night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up, flip it around and snap a payback picture
I'll send it to my ex, I'll send it to my ex and send 'em both a text
Saying we ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight

Well, I ain't going home alone tonight
Girl, you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go home alone tonight
Baby, don't let me go home alone
Home alone tonight

// Razor Blade //

You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "Hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You ain't
Used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade

You can't escape it if you wanted to
You don't know what you got yourself into

You're blindfolded
Walking south down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
Cut you like a razor blade
She cut you like a razor blade

// Fast //

Fast
That's the kind of car you wanna drive when you're sixteen
Fast
That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team
Fast
Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
Is too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it don't work like that

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, and round it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, yeah man
It goes too fast
It just goes too fast
Way too fast

// Move //

Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Backed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard
To a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern bells
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Your side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you

M-O-V-E, I love it
Yeah, I love it when you get that beat
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting all week to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move

Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love the way you, love the way you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you

Move like you do
Sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Girl, just look at you
Legs and your hips
Live oak, moonlit
When that song hits
Damn, you turn it loose
Stars of a southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ playin' throwback tunes
I wanna move when you
But I can't move when you
No, I can't move when you move
No, I can't move when you move

// Just Over //

She called and said she wanted to see me
I said, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
Except, where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over

Like the page, she's turning over
Like the life, she's starting over
Without me

I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over
Drink over, then it would be over
Back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over
It's just over
It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over

// Love It Gone //

I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that kissing angel good morning song
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone

Why don't you slip into something off the frequent menu
Kick back, let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so good on
Let me, let me love it gone

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
So long

This night looks good on you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it
And every little inch of you
Let me love it, let me, let me love it

Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want
I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
Baby, let me love it gone

Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Let me love it
Let me, let me love it
Baby, let me love it gone

// Way Way Back //

Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in
A little wild and young kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around, we can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then
Girl, close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it

Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back

Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?

Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it

Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back

// To The Moon And Back //

Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you travelled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back

Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back

Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

// Huntin', Fishin' And Lovin' Every Day //

If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field down wind
If I could make a nickel off of turnin' them bass
Never worry bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

I get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a 9.9 two-stroke (Mercury)
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go

And we get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here
Knee-deep in the Muckalee

Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes, let's go there in our minds

Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin, dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

// Scarecrows //

We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a 2 mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

I don't get back near enough and just like these fields
Yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows

So much has changed
But then again, it ain't

Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
Just like the scarecrows

// Corner Booth //

Place is packed, having a blast.
Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back.
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind.
Then the door swings open, I looked left.
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest.
There goes my good time

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now.
Looks like I'll be hanging around.
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care.
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here.
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd.

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

Maybe one in the back with the sear torn,
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor.
Cause, I know you're on the dancefloor baby.

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
I just wanna forget everything we done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
When I need one.

// Little Boys Grow Up And Dogs Get Old //

Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, "Son he's yours from now on"
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said "you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home"
"And be a good boy"
"Now you be a good boy"

And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

// Buddies //

Buddies
They roll up in the mornin'
And hand you a coffee
Tell ya hurry up
The fish ain't gonna wait on you

Buddies
They don't give you no warning
When they shoot up a stop sign
Out on some ol' country road

I've got ones that I've fought with
And out run the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime
If I had it

One on the wagon
And one out there draggin'
A plow behind
an old John Deere

They work hard for their money
Their trucks all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin, deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin' 
Buddies

Buddies
They smell trouble 'fore it happens
And when it starts to happen
They're right with you 
Rollin' in a parking lot

Buddies
They make you girlfriend so mad
Keep your momma from sleepin'
Cause they both know too well that

I've got ones that I've fought with
And out run the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime
If I had it

One on the wagon
And one out there draggin' 
A plow behind 
An old John Deere

They work hard for their money
Their trucks all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Buddies

I got one on a humvee
That keeps all of us free
And one that got his heartbroke
And went half crazy

Got one that moved far away
One that rings my phone everyday
And one when he hears this
He'll shed a tear

They work hard for their money
Their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Trash talkin' buddies
All true
