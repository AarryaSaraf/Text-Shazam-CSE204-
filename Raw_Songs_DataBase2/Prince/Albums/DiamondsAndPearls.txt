// Thunder //

Thunder - all thru the night
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight

Oooo - Thunder
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Love - nobody know just how it was born
Love - first came to me with the radio on
Jumped up in my body with an attitude
Kissed me on the mouth and said "Your leader take me to"

'Twas like thunder all thru the night
And a promise to see jesus in the morning light
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Love's kiss was running all thru my veins
The bed started shakin', I don't know who to blame
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Is this my sweet savior or the devil in disguise

'Twas like thunder (oh) all thru the night (all through)
Promise to see jesus in the morning light
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Thunder - hey hey
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(it was truly truly)
Like rain falling on a window pane
Tears came to my eyes when I asked her name
Made me holler when it finally came
Said "Only the children born of me will remain"

'Twas like thunder all thru the night
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light (mornin' light)
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Thunder

It will be all right (all right)
(it was truly like thunder)
Don't do it like that, do it like this
Oh oh (thunder) oh oh (thunder) oh ohhhhhh

Thunder (thunder)

(thunder)

(it was truley truly like)

Like thunder (thunder) all thru the night (thunder yeah)
Promise to see Jesus in the morning light (it will be all right)
Love say "Take my hand, it'll be alright (it's gonna be alright)
C'mon save your soul tonight"

Ooooo Thunder
Thunder, thunder yeah yeah yeah

// Diamonds And Pearls //

This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away

I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what u're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right
If we always fight
Why can't we just let love decide (Let love decide)

Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan (Love is the master plan)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M (To the M)
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time (There will come a time)
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)
And everything you'll look 4 you'll find (Take a look inside)

That will be the time (That will be the time)
That everything will shine (Forever)
So bright it makes you colorblind (You will be color blind)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just you my love

If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Pearls)
Would you be a happy boy or a girl (Yeah yeah)
If I could I would give you the world (Give you the world)
All I can do is just offer you my love (All I can do)

If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)
Would you be, would you, would you
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy little baby)
A happy boy or a girl
If I could I would give you the world

// Strollin' //

Close the shop, let's take a drive
Take a break from 9 to 5
It's so great to be alive, oh yeah
We could rent some roller skates
We could skate around the lake
If we don't know how, we'll fake it, oh yeah

Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin', oh yeah

Let's forget about the time (time)
Let's relax and ease our mind (mind)
We deserve to just feel fine, oh yeah
We could stroll the mezzanine (stroll)
Buy some dirty magazine
Laugh behind it while we're eatin' ice cream (ha ha ha ha)

Strollin', strollin' we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin' oh yeah

See the man with the blue guitar
Maybe one day he'll be a star
Give him your ice cream and
I'll give him the keys to my car
There's so much hate goin' round
Hard to not let it get you down
Least we can do is make a joyful sound, oh yeah

Strollin', strollin', we could have fun just strollin'
Rockin', rollin', oh yeah

Strollin', strollin'
Rockin', rollin' (we could have fun, we could have fun)
Oh yeah (just strollin')

Close the shop, let's take a ride (strollin', strollin')
Take a break from 9 to 5 (we could have fun just strollin')
It's so great, so great to be alive (Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')
(we could have fun just strollin')
Rockin', Rollin' (Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')

(Rockin', rollin', oh yeah)

Oh yeah, strollin', strollin' (Strollin', strollin')

// Willing And Able //

Said I'm willin' and I'm able
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table
I've been holdin' back this feelin'
4 far 2 long
Now that I'm willin', it's a fact
Is truly mighty strong
Like a child lost in the wilderness
'Till I reach my destination, I won't rest

Cuz I'm willin' (willin')
And I'm able (able)
I'm ready 2 place my cards on the table (table)

There's some kings in my deck and a queen or 2
So u know there ain't nothin',
Nothin' that I wouldn't do (Nothin' that I wouldn't do)
It 'twas a long time coming,
But now that it's here
All the non-believers better fear me

Cuz I'm willin (willin' and able)
And I'm able
I got good and plenty cards
2 place on the table (table)

Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long
(Been holdin' back this feeling 4 far 2 long)
Now that I'm willing, (this feelin')
This feelin'
It's truly mighty strong (truly, I... I)

I'm willing (willin')
And able (able)
My vision is all clear, I'm feelin' kinda stable
U know I am, u know I am
Ready 2 whisper (whisper, whatcha say)
Ready 2 shout (shout, now whatcha say)
Ready 2 scream (scream, now whatcha say)
From the highest mountain top (whatcha say, whatcha say)

Lord, I'm willing and able
I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

(willin')
(able)
(willin' and able)

I wanna dance and sing, somebody watch me do my thing
(dance and sing, let me watch u do your thing)
(bring it to me)

Let me take a bite
2 see if u're ripe
I'm kinda thinkin' about
Takin' a hunk, chunk
A piece of your love tonight

Well hello, MC T on a mello
Swing low to the tempo
As I flow on a roll
Here we go, willing and able
Start the show right
With that type of hype
Lay my cards on the table tonite
Don't take me light
My flow hits u just like a lead pipe
While I'm clockin'
U just say 'fess
About the boots I'm knockin'
It ain't like that
(somethin' to keep the Jimmy so get) off my back
In fact u lack the knack
Step back before I show u how a fool acts, baby

Yeah

// Gett Off //

How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
There's a rumor goin' all round that you ain't been gettin' served
They say that you ain't you know what
In baby who knows how long
It's hard for me to say what's right
When all I want to do is wrong

Gett off, twenty three positions in a one night stand
Gett off, I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off, let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off, if you want to baby here I am (here I am)

I clocked the jizz from a friend
Of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said you told her a fantasy
That got her all wet (wet)
Something about a little box with a
Mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
I knew that we could slide

Gett off, twenty three positions in a one night stand
Gett off, I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off, let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off, if you want to baby here I am (here I am)

Gett off (Gett off)

One, two, three, no, little cutie, I ain't drinkin' (Gett off)
Scope this, I was just thinkin'
You + me, what a ride
If you was thinkin' the same
We could continue outside (Gett off)
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
Strip your dress down
Like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Lemme show you baby I'm a talented boy

Everybody grab a body
Pump it like you want somebody

Gett off (Gett off)

So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (Gett off)
In my paisley crib
Whatcha want to eat? "Ribs"
Ha, toy, I don't serve ribs
You better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when you sat down

Honey them hips is gone
That's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of something James used to say

"I like 'em fat"
"I like 'em proud"
"Ya gotta have a mother for me"

Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight your a star
And I'm the big dipper

(Kick it)

(Gett off)

(Gett off)

How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve (Gett off)
There's a rumor goin' all round that you ain't been gettin' served (Gett off)
They say that you ain't you know what in baby who knows how long
(Gett off) It's hard for me to say what's right when all I want to do is wrong

Gett off, twenty three positions in a one night stand
Gett off, I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off, let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off, if you want to baby here I am

Come on

Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off

// Walk Don't Walk //

Walk on their side of the street?
Don't walk where it feels the best?
Walk away from people u meet?
Don't talk 2 strangers
Unless they walk the way u want them 2?

Don't walk unless the others do?
I said walk, like u could use a ride?
Don't walk with a confident stride
Then people will walk over u
Don't talk until they tell u 2?
Don't talk if it's against the rules?
Just walk away and be a fool?
That's what they wantcha 2 do
Yeah, that's what they want u 2 do

Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

Don't talk if it's against the rules?
Just walk away and be a fool?
That's what they wantcha 2 do
So u got 2 walk like u wanna make it!
Don't walk like u just can't take it
Go on and walk on any side you like!
Don't walk wherever they tell u 2 - psyche!
The sun will shine upon u one day
If u're always walkin' your way

The sun will shine upon u one day
If u're always walkin' your way

Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

(tellin' me now, just walkin')
Said I'm walkin' on your side of the street (tellin' me now, just walkin')
I'm talkin' 2 the people I meet (tellin' me now, just walkin')
Alright

Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk
Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk
Walk - don't walk
Talk - don't talk

// Jughead //

Keep it nice and quiet, keep it nice and quiet

Ha, Germany, Paris France - we gettin' stupid
Yeah, Stockholm Sweden, we love ya

Let me shed, it's easier said code red
Bust the new groove just hyped 4 the jughead
Bass thumpin' everybody's doin the bumpin'
Oops, I slipped on a move
I think it's time 2 bust somethin'
Sleazy, but cool and easy
("Is this the right one?")
Yeah - this is 4 the hood
Better keep it greasy
Better yet on a smooth tip
I don't wanna sweat
I want my slimmie 2 get with this
Move your head and shoulders from side 2 side
Take your back foot, and then u let it slide
Yo, in a fade motion, lots of attitude, coast 2 coast
Then u're floatin' homeboys boastin' 
U made his skeeze freeze
U've been chosen, P
Ladies and gentlemen, NPG introduces the...

Yeah, baby's gettin' busy in my face
Cold housin' a future
Everything has been well placed
This daddy's 2 fly
He bust the jughead as he floats to the other side
U watch the rotation, there's a bit of hesitation
This is some new hype stuff u're facin'

U gotta come with a new git
The J-U-G-H-E-A-D, and I'm flowin' with it
U could say I'm on a roll
NPG and y'all, and we're gettin' bold, oh
Yes - bold steps must be taken
2 bump a nation their scrutiny is what I'm facin'
As u pump the volume to what I'm sayin'
U'd catch me dead before you catch me
Doin' anything but the...

Jughead (Jughead)
Yeah, we gettin' funky in the house tonite
Kickin' the jughead (Doin' the jughead)

Gettin' busy in the corner (Oh yes, is that Levi?!)
Holdin' my own - u think I'm posin'

Clockin' a freak in a low pro

Oh yeah - That's what I'm sayin' (get funky)
That's what I'm sayin'
That's what I'm sayin'

Who turn the mother out?

(That's what I'm sayin')
Tony, you were excellent (That's what I'm sayin')
What you need is a manager (That's what I'm sayin')

For what?
I can make you... Money minders are like parasites
They pose and wheelers and
Dealers for your rights. And most
Companies say that you need em!
Not me... But I've kicked back, observed, and
I'm honest... Watched 'em bleed 'em
Artists young and old
I can bring you to the top! Where'd this unwritten law come from anyway?
That years after the contract you should
Still be gettin' paid? Boy, I go broke
And hit the skids before I take care of
A rich sucker's kids. Hell,
My contract... A contract ain't no pension plan,
My contract... Years after this my kids are still
Gonna make the grand.
Tony, you... And you laugh at my brother Little Richard
When he says you ain't gave him nothing.
Let's leave him out of this Hell, that ain't no joke.
His songs are still sellin', that man
Could die broke. So fellow artists,
U need me... Push for yours, and watch for
Mr. Money Minder, as we settle the score.
Tony...

// Money Don't Matter 2 Night //

One more card and it's 22
Unlucky 4 him again
He never had respect 4 money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough
2 treat his lady right
He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter 2 night'

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night

Look, here's a cool investment
They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in ever color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that...

Money don't matter 2 night (don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
And it sure don't matter 2 night

(ooh-wee-ooh, don't matter)
(it don't matter 2 night, no)

Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
2 send a child off 2 war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying 4? (is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live 4
Then long life will come 2 pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
And u think u got it bad

Money don't matter 2 night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (make certain that your soul's alright)
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,
... it sure don't matter 2 night

Money don't matter 2 night
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday, yesterday)
Just when u think u've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when u find out that u're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
Money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter 2 night

I push for a beat that is greasy
I'll dis a beat if it teases
Mark this down as I state it...
I like my funk concentrated
The pop seem, hmmm, a little overrated
U sure can tell where we're steppin'
There's some grease on the stage
Ooops, I just stepped in it... (push)
Circlin' as we slide
The full stride for the ride
On a watered-down tip
We could never get by (push)
Fellas... (get on the mike)
Check it out, here's what u gotta do (push)
Gotta step in the room with the mood
Never juicin' yourself,
Just a confident attitude (push)
Believe me, u will get busy
Your mouth'll drop open
[As u watch the slimmies funkin'] (push)
But u don't want the one who's jockin'
Cause it's all about the clockin' (push)
Step 1, step off 2 the dance floor (push up on it)
There ya go, y'all, yeah (push)

(1...eno... 1,2,3) (push, push, push)

Push up on it (get on the mike, woman)

U don't want me on the mike Push up on it

No man, u don't want me on the mike (don't stop until u go)
(get on the mike) Push up on it
(push)
It's thunder when I'm on the mike (push) I push
Daddy Pop's in the house
And u're sure 2 like his diamonds (push) I push
Sure 2 like his pearls
I'm good 2 cream every boy and girl
Cuz I'm a stollin',
Steady hip-hop rockin' rollin (push)
A willing and able horny pony
And I'm pumpin' em, I'm pumpin' em, (push)
I'm pump-pump-pump-pump-pumpin' em
From Pakistan 2 Poland (push)
Straight into your town
Snatchin' up kiddies (get on the mike)
Like a circus clown (get on the mike)
(push)

(get on the microphone)

Well, all u people out there, (push)
U'd better be 'ware
Cuz they call me Rosie G
And I just don't care (push)
I like 2 step, all night long
Rappin', hiphopin', and pushin this song
The song gets higher and it sets u on fire (push)
Like the lion in the jungle (get on the mike)
It takes you all higher (push)
My momma said "Girl, u know it ain't cool, (get on ...)
Said ya don't wanna play by nobody's rules"
I said "Momma chill out, (push)
And give me a break, cause
I know I got just what it takes" (push)
I said "Momma don't put me under pressure (get on, get on ...)

// Insatiable //

No one that I've ever, knows how 2 handle my body

The way u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

I got a jones, Martha
Oh yeah, it be like this (I can't have a hug)
I can't have a hug (unless)
Unless I have a kiss

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

Like a wildcat, Martha, in a celibate rage
I want your love, in my dirty little cage
Can u understand, Martha?

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

2 night we video...
No one will ever know
We'll erase the naughty bits
I'll show my...
If you show your...
I can't help it, Martha {'insatiable' repeated in the background}
I can't help what u do 2 me
U are my every fantasy
There's no telling how far I'd go
Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

Please, baby, don't say no
Cuz I'll surely go crazy
OK, so all u do is push the little red button...
And I belong 2 u and your little video box

Hey - don't look at the clock, yeah
It's 2:45, we got all night

First u gotta tell me what u want me to do

My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u
There's no tellin' how far I'd go
Cuz when it comes 2 u, I know
I'm insatiable and I just can't stop
Even if I wasn't thirsty,
I would drink every drop

So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do u really want all my clothes off? (yes)
What are u gonna do to prove it?
Aren't u afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the show
Turn the lights down low (Turn the lights down lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what 2 do
Have u done this before? (I don't know)
U say u want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
I don't know, I don't care

(My body, baby, u truly do)
I know I could be nasty with u

(Up and down, just like a seesaw) ((back and forth))
(back and forth)
Listen (oh girl, I'm fallin')
I love u, baby

I love u baby, you're mine
U're nastier than I thought
It's just 2:49...

// Live 4 Love //

Lauch procedure commence
Countdown start
10,9,8,7,6,5,4

Keep goin'

Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...

30,000 feet and still-a-counting (live 4 love)
The attack on my plane is steadily mounting (live 4 love)
They killed my buddy, but I'm supposed to feel nothing (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love - I'm calling...
Live 4 love

Kicked out of my home at 17 (live 4 love) ((get outta here))
A real family,
Now what does that mean (what does that mean) (live 4 love)
Don't nobody know the trouble I've seen (live 4 love)

How can I live 4 love? I'm calling...
Live 4 love
Live 4 love
Live 4 love - Calling, I'm calling
Live 4 love

My mission, so they said, was just 2 drop the bombs
Acceleration into temporal space continuum now begins...
Just like I got no conscience, just like I got no qualms
Alpha 7, acknowledge
Now what does that mean?

Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go
Go Tommy go, go tommy go

So here, my target is approaching
The angel on my shoulder starts coaching

"Live 4 Love, without love u don't live"

Boom - I take a deep breath
Is it boom - life?
Is it boom - death?

(live 4 love)

Maybe I was better off staying in school (live 4 love)
But everybody said flying planes was cool (live 4 love)
It's so easy 4 them 2 say
Cuz they never have to go through

How can I live 4 love? (live 4 love) I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love - I'm calling
Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love
Live 4 love

Damn, I got hit, but I still complete the mission (live 4 love)
I flash upon my whole life just-a-steady wishin' (live 4 love)
The choice u make is vital
So at the end of my recital
I say - U got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

Keep goin'

Live 4 love
Live 4 love (live 4 love)
Live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love), (live 4 love)
Live (live 4 love)

Live 4 love, without love u don't live
And how u make it is based on what you're givin' back
In fact, only a few of us slip through the cracks
Through generations,
The cards have always been stacked against us (live 4 love)
2 love each other is a must
If we just trust and cut the fuss
Beleive me, unity is a must
Listen everybody, as I spread the word
Everything is hazy when your vision's blurred
I'm kickin' reality in the streets of the city
There's this mentality what goes around comes around
And gangk any clown who ain't down
With the colors that u're sportin' 'round
Listen G, u are supposed 2 be strivin'
2 be the best that u can be
So stop tryin' 2 dominate and push and shove (live 4 love)
C'mon y'all, we got 2 live 4 love (live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)

(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love),(live 4 love)
