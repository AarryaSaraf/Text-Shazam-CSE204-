Album: 1999

// 1999 //

Don't worry, I won't hurt you
I only want you to have some fun

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
Forgive me if it goes astray
But when I woke up this morning
Could have sworn it was judgement day
The sky was all purple
There were people runnin' everywhere
Tryin' to run from the destruction
You know I didn't even care

'Cause they say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999

I was dreamin' when I wrote this
So sue me if I go too fast
But life is just a party
And parties weren't meant to last
War is all around us
My mind says, "Prepare to fight"
So if I gotta die
I'm gonna listen to my body tonight
Yeah

They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
Yeah, yeah, shh

Lemme tell ya somethin'
If you didn't come to party
Don't bother knockin' on my door, oh
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar, yeah, yeah
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day, oh
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away
Oh

They say
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
(We're runnin' outta time)
So tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we gonna, we gonna, oh
Say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
No, no
Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we gonna, we gonna, woo

Alright, 1999
You say it, 1999
Ooh, 1999, oh, 1999
Don't stop, don't stop, say it one more time
2000, zero-zero, party over, oops, out of time
Yeah, yeah
Tonight I'm gonna party like it's 1999
So tonight we're gonna, we're gonna, woo

Yeah, 1999
Don'tcha wanna go? (1999)
Don'tcha wanna go? (1999)
We could all die any day (1999)
I don't wanna die
I'd rather dance my life away 1999
Listen to what I'm tryin' to say
Everybody, everybody say, "Party"
C'mon now, you say, "Party"
That's right, everybody say "Party"
Can't run from the revelation, no (Party)
Sing it for your nation y'all, "Party"
Tell me what you're singin', baby say, "Party"
Telephone's a-ringin', mama (Party)
C'mon, c'mon, you say, "Party"
Everybody, two times, "Party"
Woo, work it down to the ground, say, "Party"
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Party)
Come on, oh, take my body, baby (Party)
That's right, c'mon, sing the song (Party)

Got a lion in my pocket mama, say, "Party"
Oh, and he's ready to roar (Party)
Ah

Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?
Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?

// Little Red Corvette //

I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say - "What have I got to lose?"

And honey, I say Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little Red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class

But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh yeah!

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes you are)
Little Red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little Red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey

Little Red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your Little Red Corvette right in the ground
(Little Red Corvette)
Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
(Little Red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!

Baby, you're much too fast
Little Red Corvette
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
(Little Red Corvette)

Babe, you got to slow down (you got to slow down)
Little Red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Little Red Corvette

// Delirious //

I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer

And girl I got a lot

Delirious (Delirious)
Delirious (Delirious)

Girl you gotta take me 4 a little ride up and down
In and out and around your lake

I'm delirious (Delirious)
You, you, you get me delirious (Delirious)
Baby, lay me down
Delirious (Delirious)
The room, the room, the room is spinnin' around (Delirious)
Yeah, I'm delirio, yeah, oh I'm, oh I'm (Delirious)

It's strange, I'm more comfortable around U when I'm naked,
Can U hear me?
I wonder if U have any mercy, don't torture me

Stop the music baby, automatic fool

Something honey don't compute (Don't not compute)

Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water they drink
Because why else would a woman want to treat a man so bad?

Some people think I'm kind of smart
Why must a fellow stop with you before he starts?
It don't compute, mama (Does not compute)
Something don't compute (Don't not compute)

Taxi! Taxi!

Lady cab driver - Can U take me 4 a ride?
Don't know where I'm goin' 'cuz I don't know where I've been
So just put your foot on the gas - let's drive
Lady - don't ask questions
Promise I'll tell U no lies
Trouble winds r blowin', I'm growin' cold
Get me outta here - I feel I'm gonna die

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds r blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

Lady - I'm so lonely
I know that's not the way 2 be
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me 2 your mansion
Honey, let's go everywhere
Help me girl I'm drownin', mass confusion in my head
Will U accept my tears 2 pay the fare?

Lady cab driver, roll up your wndow fast
Lately trouble winds r blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

Lady cab driver - Can U take me 4 a ride?

Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds r blowin' hard, and I don't know if I can last

This is 4 the cab U have 2 drive 4 no money at all
This is 4 why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
This is 4 politicians who r bored and believe in war
This - Yeah, that's 4 me, that's who that 1's 4
This is 4 discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is 4 whoever taught U how 2 kiss in designer jeans
That 1's 4- That 1's 4- 4 U have 2 live
This 1's 4 the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy -
The ones that don't know how 2 give
This 1's 4 Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this 1- ooh! Yeah - That's the 1.
That's 4- that's 4 the- the creator of man
This is 4 the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is 4 the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is 4- and that's 4 U, and that's who that 1's 4
This is 4 the women, so beautifully complex
This 1's 4 love without sex
This is 4 the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow
Not knowing where I'm going
This galaxy's better than not having a place 2 go
And now I know (I know)
