// P Control //

Nuestra presentacion especial comenzara en breve
(Our special presentation will start shortly)
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores
(But first a message from our sponsors)
Uh, yeah
Uh

Good mornin' ladies and gentlemen ("What hotel number is she in?")
Boys and motherfuckin' girls ("319, 319" "Cool")
This is your captain with no name speakin'
And I'm here 2 rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman U already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books 4 the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat 4 some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did 2 the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work 4 free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are triflin'?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, U need Pussy Control'" (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Verse 2
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick wanna stick her
Uh, talkin' more Schick than a Bic
'Bout how he gonna make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, U crazy if U don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
U can go platinum 4 times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody wanna hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't wanna know
Boy, U better act like U understand
When U roll with Pussy Control" (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

Breakdown
(Are U ready 4 the best Pussy U ever felt?) [x2]

With one more verse 2 the story
I need another piece of your ear
I wanna hip U all 2 the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rollin' 4-deep
3 sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl drivin' her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said "Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that U're here
I fear U're lonely and U want 2 know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that U're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I wanna be
But it's gonna be hard as hell
2 keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want 2 sell, sell, sell (75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!)
Can I tell U what I'm thinkin' that U already know?
U need a motherfucker that respects your name"
Now say it, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make'em act like they know
U are, was, and always will be Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Peace and be wild (Aaah, Pussy Control)

Say what, huh? (Oh)
Oh no, don't U think about callin' her a ho (Are U ready?)
U juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talkin' about Pussy Control
Huh, can U dig it?

Aaah, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Oh (Are U ready?)

Aaah, Pussy Control (Are U ready?)
Oh (Are U ready?)

Would U please look at this mother next 2 me
Frontin' more booty than Peru got keys

Uh huh, uh huh
Hold up, wait a minute

Perhaps U'd like 2 join us in a mission
Of fishin' 4 logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, U're feelin' like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time U must defend
Your right 2 die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't gonna hurt U

// We March //

Uno para todos, y todos para uno [One 4 all and all 4 one]
March, we march

(Whoa) [x6 in BG]
March, we march [x2]

If this is the same avenue my ancestors fought 2 liberate
How come I can't buy a piece of it even if my credit's straight?
If all the water's dirty and I wanna lay the pipe, my dammy
The river that I drink from, will it be the same as your mammy?

Now's the time 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marchin' 4

If this is the same sister that U cannot stop calling a bitch (Bitch)
It will be the same one that will leave your broke ass in a ditch (Ditch)
If U can't find a better reason 2 call this woman otherwise
Then don't cry, U made the bed in which U lie

Now's the time 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)

Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marchin' 4

(Whoa) [x4 in BG]
March, we march (Come on)
March, we march
Yes we do!

Dig..
Now we clarify 4ever, in other words as long as it takes
We ain't got no use 4 ice cream without the cake (Umm)
We ain't got no time 4 excuses, the promised land belongs 2 all
We can march in peace but U best watch your back if another leader falls

March, we march
[Feet stompin'!]
March, we march

He said it, she said it and I say...
Now's the time (now's the time) 2 find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason (Yeah) and frees the mind (free your mind)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line (Get in line!)
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)

Next time we march (Oh yeah) (Whoa)
Kickin' down the door

The fun don't stop the bacon
That's when the money gonna stop the shakin'

I know that next time we march, yeah

// The Most Beautiful Girl In The World //

Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope U are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cuz after U all one can do is die, oh

Could U be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could U be?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see U and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face 2 be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh yes, oh

Could U be (could U be) the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could U be?
It's plain 2 see U're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes U are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, 2 far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason 2 ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

Could U be (could U be) the most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain 2 see (plain 2 see) U're the reason that God made a girl

Oh yeah! (Oh, yes U are)
Girl (Could U be?)
U must be ... oh yeah!
(Could U be?)
U're the reason ... oh yeah
(Could) [x3]

// Dolphin //

How beautiful do the words have 2 be
Before they conquer every heart?
How will U know if I'm even in the right key
If U make me stop before I start?

If I came back as a dolphin
Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins
But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

Why does my brother have 2 go hungry
When U told him there was food 4 all?
This is the man that stands next 2 the man
That stands 2 catch U when U fall (Oh!)

If I came back as a dolphin
Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins
But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

If I'm under water, will U find me? (Find me [x4])
Will U shine a light and try 2 guide me?
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door
But U wouldn't let me in

How beautiful do the words have 2 be
Before they conquer every heart? (Oh!)

If I came back as a dolphin
Would U listen 2 me then?
Would U let me be your friend?
Would U let me in?
U can cut off all my fins
But 2 your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let U tell me how 2 swim
Come back in the end as a dolphin (Oh)
(I'll come back, baby)
(Let me in, let me in) As a dolphin
(Be my friend) Dolphin
(Yeah, yeah)

Dolphin
As a dolphin
As a dolphin
As a dolphin

The ride up front is better when U've been in the back

Anybody can sing
There's more 2 genius than the word my sister anything I would bring
Or would U rather dine alone?
If U change your mind, U can reach me on your video phone
It's a dime, as in dollars and that's my 2 bloody cents

// Shy //

After a month of just bein' alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinkin'"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinkin'
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least 4 2night
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Oh baby (Shy)

After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm goin' back 2morrow 2 make sure he's dead
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but U can call me ... "

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy

Shy - Lips say no but the body say might
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home..
Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

The girl was rough, but he called her bluff
And he told her not 2 know was better
Fact or fiction he wondered
And that's when the rain and thunder got wetter
And at the top of the page he wrote ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

(Oh, say it now, yeah)
(Shy, shy!)
(Shy)

Ooh baby, don't U wanna be alone 2night?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're gonna take the long way home 2night

// Eye Hate U //

U have just accessed the Hate Experience
Do U wish 2 change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience
I never thought that U would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
U gave your body 2 another in the name of fun
I hope U had some baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate U - Now everyday would be a waste of time
Cuz I hate U

I never thought that I could feel this way
2 fall in love was a table reserved 4 fools
Say U're sorry if U wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through

It's so sad but I hate U like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate U - Now everyday would be a waste of time
Cuz I hate U

This court is now in session
Would the defendant please rise?
State your name 4 the court
Never mind (Billy Jack Bitch)
U're being charged with one 2 many counts of heartbreaking
In the 1st degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is U and me

Your honor, may I call 2 the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what U did, how U did it and uh.. who U did it with
So U might as well plead guilty cuz U sure can't plead the 5th
Now raise your right hand
Do U swear 2 tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like U used 2 so help U God?
Nod your head one time if U hear me
If U don't, I'll have 2 use the rod
Anything 2 make U see that uh.. U're gonna miss me
Yeah, U're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!

If it please the court
I'd like 2 have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used 2 be
I want it 2 be so good she falls back in love with me

Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want U 2 pump your hips like U used 2
And, baby, U better stay on the beat
Did U do 2 your other man the same things that U did 2 me?
Right now I hate U so much I wanna make love until U see
That it's killin' me, baby, 2 be without U
Cuz all I ever wanted 2 do was 2 be with U ... ow!

I hate U (I hate U)
Because I love U (Because I love U)
But I can't love U (I can't love U)
Because I hate U (I hate U)

Because I love U
I love U, baby
I love U [x3]

I love U cuz U're all that's ever on my mind
I hate U because I love U

// Gold //

There's a mountain & it's mighty high 
You cannot see the top unless you fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't no where 2 go if you hang around

Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold, mmm

There's an ocean of despair
There are people livin' there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so what you tryin' 2 say?

Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold, no no
All that glitters ain't gold, no no

There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now that's a theory and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way 4 those who want 2 go

Everybody wants 2 sell what's already been sold (Sold)
Everybody wants 2 tell what's already been told (Told)
What's the use of bein' young if you ain't gonna get old? (Old)
Even at the center of fire there is cold (Cold)
All that glitters (glitters) ain't gold, no no no no no
All that glitters ain't gold
Alright

All that glitters, all that glitters, all that glitters.. ain't gold

Na na na na na na na (Gold [x4])
Na na na na na na na (Gold [x4])
Gold, gold, gold
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold (Na na na na na na na)
All that glitters ain't gold, gold, gold (Na na na na na na na)
All that glitters ain't gold, oh
Oh yeah
1 2.. 1 2 3, let's go!

(Na na na na na na na) [repeat]

You are now an official member of the New Power Generation
Welcome 2 The Dawn

All that glitters ain't gold (Gold) [repeat & loop]
