Hey, lover, I got a sugar cane
That I want to lose in you
Baby, can you stand pain
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby

All I want to see is the love in you eyes
And all I want to hear is your sweet love
Hey lover, it's a golden flame
Tell me, tell me baby that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me girl

We'd be so lost
In our mouths
The best
I feel it every day
You feel so wrong
Been alone
If you just follow somebody, someday

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you
You just love me to death
Oh, wee, baby
You leave me without
Breath, oh baby
Ooh, yeah

You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
Hey, lover, will you call my name
Your love is driving me
You're driving me insane

Crazy, baby, oh
Crazy about your love

Soft and wet
You know you are
Soft and wet
Oh, sugar, you know you are
Soft and wet
Ooh...
Soft and wet
