Get wild!
Get wild!
Get wild!
Get wild!

When you're sick of that nine to five
And you're ready to come alive
And you looked both high and low
And you can't find a trumpet that blows

Come on baby, where the good times never die
Come on baby, where the damsels good and fly
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If you wanna get real freaky, now it's time to try, come on

Get wild!
Everybody up in the place
Get wild!
It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild!
All you nasty girls and boys
If you wanna get wild, say yeah
Make some noise!
Make some noise!
