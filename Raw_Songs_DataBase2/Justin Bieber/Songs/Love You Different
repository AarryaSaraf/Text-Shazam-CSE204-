I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different

You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)
When we touch, I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)

There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this

I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for

You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you different
Just the way you are

No matter how different, you're beautiful
I can't make this up, no, baby, ain't no need to beat your face in
Fenty, want you on the cover, under covers ain't no rubbers
On this planet, I'll treat you like a mother, let's make babies

There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I'm not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises
Just remember this

I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for


You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you (Ooh) different (Ooh)
Just the way you are


I and I need you in my life
Even when the fire burnin', I need you fi di light
It's a different night with you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright
This the mutual, it's not usual when I'm around you, I-I-I (Oh)
Dem goosebumps, dem goosebumps, the truth hurt and you know
A real ting we feel this time (Oh)
You gimme goosebumps, yeah, yeah


I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for
