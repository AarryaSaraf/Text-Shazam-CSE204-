Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause, baby, I didn't


{That should be me} holding your hand
{That should be me} making you laugh (Yeah)
{That should be me}, this is so sad
{That should be me}, that should be me (Ooh oh)
That should be me feeling your kiss (Feeling your kiss)
That should be me buying you gifts (Buying you gifts)
This is so wrong

'Til you believe
{That that should be me}
That should be me (No, oh-oh, ooh)


You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
{Did you think that I wouldn't see you out} (at the movies?)
What you doing to me?
(You're taking him where we used to go)

It's working 'cause you know that


{That should be me} holding your hand (holding your hand)
{That should be me} making you laugh (Oh)

{That should be me, that should be me} (That should be me)
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
{This is so wrong}
{I can't go on}
'Til you believe ('Til you believe)
{That that should be me}

I need to know (I need to know)
Should I fight for love or disarm? (Should I fight for love)
It's getting harder to shield (It's getting harder to shield)
{This pain in my heart}
(Woo, hey yeah)
(Ooh-ooh)

{That should be me} holding your hand

Holding your hand, that should be me (Oh yeah)
The one making you laugh, oh baby (Oh-oh, baby)
Oh, that should be me (That should be me)
That should be me giving you flowers (That should be me)
That should be me talking for hours oh (I never should've let you go oh oh, oh baby)
That should be me (Ooh, bab)
That should be me (That should be me, yeah)
