Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me

Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me


Ooh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences

How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no


Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me (Yeah, you really get me, {ooh})
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me *Ooh, that's where you send me*
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me *Ooh, you really get me*


Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Ooh)
