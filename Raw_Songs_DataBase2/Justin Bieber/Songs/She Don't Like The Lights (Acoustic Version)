She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Hate it when we're miles apart

And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
Gonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her
She don't wanna think cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights, whoa
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoa
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights, whoa, babe
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

Now she's giving ultimatums
She don't like this life, yeah
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up, won't think twice, I can't do that

And she's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, yeah

She don't like the lights, whoa
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, whoa
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the cameras
She don't like the lights, whoa, babe
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

How can I choose between the two?
When all the lights are all I know?
I wish she could see how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life without her by my side
Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know, she don't like the lights, yeah

She don't like the lights, the lights, the lights, the lights
Whoa, no
She don't like the lights
Whoa, babe, yeah
She don't like the lights
