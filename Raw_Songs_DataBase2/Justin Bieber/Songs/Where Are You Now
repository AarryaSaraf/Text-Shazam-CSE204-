Where are you now when I need you the most?
Why don't you take my hand?
I want to be close
Help me when I am down, lift me up off the ground
Teach me right from wrong
Help me to stay strong

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Where are you now?

Where are you now now that I'm half grown?
Why are we far apart?
I feel so alone
Where are you now when nothing's going right?
Where are you now?
I can't see the light

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah

I need you to need me
Can't you see me?
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not whole when you're not with me
I want you here with me
To guide me, hold me, and love me now
Where are you now?
Oh, where are you now?

So take my hand and walk with me
Show me what to be
I need you to set me free, yeah
Oh, where are you now?

Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah
