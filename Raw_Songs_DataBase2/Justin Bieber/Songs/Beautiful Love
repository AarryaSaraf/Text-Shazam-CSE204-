More than often
We don't take advantage of the beauty all around us (All around us)
Oh-oh-oh, more than often
We take each other's time for granted 'cause we're always around us, oh, yeah

Like the blue skies
We don't appreciate the sun until it rains (Oh, we never do)
Try to see it like a child
Oh, the innocence in everything we do

A beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are
What a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are

Every day we wake up is a blessin'
Yeah, consider everything we do a new beginnin', a chance to start over
And Lord knows we ain't perfect, that's far from our usual
The journey is more than worth it, I hope this feeling's mutual

What a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are
What a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's who you are, yeah

Your heart is great, yeah, my heart is yours
Wouldn't have it any other way, it's what we're made for
Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's what we are
Beautiful love is what we are, yeah

Like the blue skies
We don't appreciate the sun until it rains (Oh, we never do)
Try to see it like a child
Oh, the innocence in everything we do

What a beautiful, beautiful love
Love, love, that's who you are
What a beautiful, beautiful love
Love, love, that's who you are, yeah

Your heart is great, yeah, my heart is yours
Wouldn't have it any other way, it's what we're made for
Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful love, love, love, that's what we are
Beautiful love is what we are, yeah

Hey, hey, hey-hey-hey
A beautiful, beautiful love, it's who you are, yeah, oh
