I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back

Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer

Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?)
Are we judged for everything we say? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer

We can't write people off
God never writes us off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off (He never writes us off)


You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book
Psalms 139:13-16
