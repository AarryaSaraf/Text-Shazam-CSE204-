Believe, believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here, uh
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

There were days when I was just broken
You know, there were nights when I was doubting myself
But you kept my heart from folding

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Wouldn't know, how it feels, to touch the sky
If you didn't believe, believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing, if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
Believe

Where would I be if you, yeah, if you didn't believe?
Wouldn't know how it feels to touch the sky, yeah
If you didn't believe, believe, believe
Where would I be if you didn't believe?
