You see, my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going, I swear, nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

See, my baby really needs some help
Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah

I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
What you expect me to do?
I'm just trying to find, find, find
The sweet love of mine

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

Why can't I find you love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh I, I must be blind
How did I let you get away?
Yeah, yeah

I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I gave it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
