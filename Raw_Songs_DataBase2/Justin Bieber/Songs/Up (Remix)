It's a big big world
It's easy to get lost in it
You've always been my girl, uh
And I'm not ready to call it quits

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the grey clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard
Baby, believe me

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up


It's a big big world
And, girl, I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in

We can make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make those grey clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard
Baby, believe me, oh, yeah


That we can't go nowhere but up, up
From here, my dear, (yeah)
Baby, we can go nowhere but up, (up, whoa)
Tell me what we've got to fear, (whoa)
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy, (yeah)
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly, (okay), with the strength of our love, (our love)
We can go nowhere but up
(Nowhere), nowhere but up
Nowhere but up

Baby, we were under ground, we're on the surface now
We're gonna make it, girl, I promise


If you believe in love and you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up


That we can't go nowhere but up, (yeah, yeah)
From here, my dear, (whoa, oh)
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
(Just tell me), tell me what we've got to fear
We'll take it to the sky pass the moon through the galaxy
As long as you're with me baby
Honestly, with the strength of our love

Nowhere but up, (I'll take you there), I'll take you there
Nowhere but up, (I'll take you there), I'll take you there
Whoa, nowhere but up, (I'll take you there, I'll take you there)
Whoa, whoa, yeah, (we can, we can), honestly, nowhere but up, (I'll take you there, I'll take you there, girl), yeah, yeah
