The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, whoa

Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, whoa

Remember those stone-washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)
(Just remember) You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (Bigger)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small (so small) from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger (Our love's bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger) and you're bigger (you're bigger), hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, (I'm bigger) I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger (I ain't small no more) and you're bigger, whoa
