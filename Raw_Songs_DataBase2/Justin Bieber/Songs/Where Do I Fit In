When the day is over and those thoughts set in
That's when I start to wonder, where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight
You say the past is behind me and it'll be alright


And You say to me, "It'll be alright"
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)


When I'm all alone and fear is all I see
Sittin' in the silence with these insecurities
And then You remind me, You're holdin' me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side


And You say to me, it'll be alright
(Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)


I know You're not a God out there hidin' on mountains, oh, no
You come right where I am, lost my way, but You found me
Like a ray in the dark, on my ugliest days
You say that You'll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You're holdin' me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright


Oh, and You say to me it'll be alright
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)


Gonna be alright, gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright


I hear those words over and over, "It'll be alright"
Go to sleep, My child, it'll be alright
Sleep soundly, My child, it'll be alright
I'm right here, My child, it'll be alright
I won't go anywhere, it'll be alright
You're in the palm of My hand, it'll be alright
My arms are wrapped around you, it'll be alright
While you sleep, I watch over you, it'll be alright
I'll take care of your loved ones, it'll be alright
Your future's in My hands, it'll be alright
Your past is forgiven, it'll be alright
Your future is secure, it'll be alright
I forgive you, it'll be alright
I'm your friend that's closer than a brother, it'll be alright
Sleep now for when the morning comes
My mercies will be new, it'll be alright


Hallelujah
