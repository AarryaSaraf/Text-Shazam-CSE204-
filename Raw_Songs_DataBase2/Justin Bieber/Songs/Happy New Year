Girl, it's almost a new year, and it's too clear
Me you and a root bear, float in my house
'Bout to count down 'cause we got a whole crew here
Yo, they 'bout to party hardy, looking for a hottie with a nice body
Oh, y'all have fun with that
And we don't need the mistletoe, we was under that
Like 20 minutes ago
And if you gave me all your love, better give me some more
'Cause the new year coming, you ain't trippin' no more
So I don't need music, rather listen to your h-h-h-h-h-h-heartbeat
Try to stop me if you want to but know you don't want to
So don't do it, don't ruin the moment I put me and you in


It's the start of the new year, baby, baby, yeah
And I know what to do with it, baby, baby, yeah
I'ma make your cheeks red when I kiss your neck
Girl, I'm never leaving, 'cause you are the best, babe
'Cause yeah, I wanna give you everything
Never fear, 'cause girl, you're coming home with me, yeah

5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, kiss me, kiss me

It's the new year me and you, dear
Yeah, I know this love was true, dear
I remember when you moved here
Everything was, oh, so new here
Yeah, I promise to be true, dear
And I'll give all my love to you, dear
Jaden Smith is to my right
That's the crew there and he's got a root beer (swag)


Got friends, called 'em all
'Cause 2012 is the year with the love
And we gon' start it off
We can get a plane today and get a car tomorrow, we don't do it small at all

I can do anything, nothing is impossible
Especially with you, girl
And I never need a new girl
This love is true girl
Aye, welcome to the crew girl

Knocking at your door like "Who that?"

Guys, they want you, I say "Too bad"


'Cause yeah, I wanna give you everything
Never fear, 'cause girl, you're coming home with me, yeah
