West coast, this one's for you
Alright

Cause we're California cruising, when we do it, California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, look where we got, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby
Look where we got, look where we got baby

Cruising down Hollywood
Windows down, feeling good, yeah
Feeling better than I've ever been, it must be adrenaline
As we're cruising down Sunset all night, all night

Cause we're California cruising, when we do it
California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby

101 is backed up, Laurel Canyon is the way to go
Windows down, Mac black truck, I can take it where you wanna go
Venice beach, you can see clear, almost as pretty as you dear
Wanna be, you should make it clear, we can roll out, skrr skrr

Cause we're California cruising, when we do it
California cruising, alright
We're California cruising, California cruising
Look where we got, look where we got baby
