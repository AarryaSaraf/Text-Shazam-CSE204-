I don't work harder when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season
And I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one

The one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

Because I'll take you home to mama
Let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends

You're way more than worth it
But I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect


I don't work hard when it's easy
I put in work when it's hard
And girl I never believed in love until I had yours
This is more than a season and I'm not just sprung
I'm not afraid to tell you, that you're the one

I'm the one I wake up thinking about
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is all good when you're around
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now

Because I'll take you home to mama
I'll let you meet my friends
Because you don't come with drama
So I want you 'til the world ends

You're way more than worth it
And I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect
You're my kind of perfect
