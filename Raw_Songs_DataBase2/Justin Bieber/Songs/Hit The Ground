I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home

Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone

And if I could
Forget about the way you loved me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground

Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
That's a part of living, whoa
That's a part of living, whoa, oh yeah

If only I could hit the ground
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
Yeah, whoa if only I could hit it
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the ground
