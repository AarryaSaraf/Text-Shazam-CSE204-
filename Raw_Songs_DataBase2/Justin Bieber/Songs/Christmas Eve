It's a holiday, yeah
Spend it with you, baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hanging stockings on the fireplace
You know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today's all about Cupid, the mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for, it sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's

So land on top of your roof, them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you, them carols are singing
Japan to Peru, baby, me and you
This Christmas Eve

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, whoa)
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

You leave some cookies out, I'mma eat 'em all
Nobody can see me but you, it's so magical, oh-oh
When we use imagination, we can fly to Never-Neverland
(Neverland)
The north pole ain't that cold, if you wanna go, I got you baby, girl

Be my date this Christmas Eve
Be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, whoa)
Kissing underneath the tree
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be, I promise I won't do you wrong

Be my date this Christmas Eve (Be my baby)
Be my holiday, my dream (Oh, whoa)
Lay your head on me, I got you, babe (Whoa, no no, oh no)
Kissing underneath the tree (I just want you right here)
I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need (Oh-oh)
Let me give you all of me each year
Together on this Christmas Eve

Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be
