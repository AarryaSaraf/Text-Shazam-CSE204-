I guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to 'em
Yeah they tryna get at me yeah but I ain't gonna feed into it
Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down

Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping

Hoping you would change me, hoping you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good, they try to break me

Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping


Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me? I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in it then they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it


Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
