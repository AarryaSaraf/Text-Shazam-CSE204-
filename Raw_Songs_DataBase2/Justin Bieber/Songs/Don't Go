Don't go, don't-
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't-
Don't go

My Mona Lisa, baby
My masterpiece, baby
When I'm in pieces, baby
You give me peace of mind
You tell me we'll be fine
You always get me right
When it's dark, you're my light

Baby, that's why I need you on the regular
And if it wasn't you, no, it would never work
Got me going out my way to show you what you're worth, don't go

(Don't go)

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)

I woke up in the city
I ain't see your face
Almost lost my mind medication
Five stars for participation
It's a COVID operation
Hope you hear this where you're stationed
I lost my Bonnie
By that time you already banged it
She armed and dangerous
That long hair got me tangled up
You are my Topanga
Stood your ground even when they aimed at us
Even through all of that pain
None of it was in vain
And I'm proud of who you become
I hope you feel the same

Frozen
Don't let me go
But let it go, please
We been so close
Don't go ghosting me
My vital OG
That's on the record
You made me better

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)

Peace and love
You talk about him like he's decent enough
See you moving, is he keeping up?
Don't know what you're doing, but you needing love
Needing love

How far can you get, girl?
You know I been in love with you since the beginning, girl
Talking out of tone to me, gotta be kidding, girl
Get you all alone with me, gotta be committed, girl

Girl, I need to see your face
Hit the gas to win the race
30 pounds of loaded bass
Move it, babe
I love the chase
Do your dirt
I keep the taste
Pop that shit
And make me wait
Shorty like that
On the up but
I might be late

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
