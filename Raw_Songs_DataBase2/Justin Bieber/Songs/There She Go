Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors
Jaws droppin', watch 'em hit the floor
Ain't even fair, no point in keepin' score
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

One, two, three, I'ma show you how you can count on me
Talk is cheap, so I'ma let all my actions speak, yeah
Centerfold, baby, goin' vogue, crazy
Rock and roll, you're my rollin' stone, baby

Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice (Oh-oh)
How you don't go nowhere without going unnoticed (Oh-oh)
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Head spinnin' like revolvin' doors
Jaws droppin', watch 'em hit the floor
Ain't even fair, no point in keepin' score
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go

Hey, mami, that's my baby
That's my best friend (That's my best friend)
I hear you callin', see you ringing from your left hand (Brr-brr)
Locked it down when you wanted, that hopeless romance (Uh)
This happened so fast, I love it when we slow dance
You can break it down, you don't need a pole
I'm so proud of you, I bust you down in rose gold
Don't be ashamed, girl, I messed around, you messed up too
It all changed when you took my name and went insane, mmm

Must be natural 'cause you don't even notice
How you don't go nowhere without going unnoticed
It's tunnel vision, baby, way you keep me focused (Focused)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Yeah)

Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Yeah)
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah)

There she go, lookin' like a shinin' star now (Woah)
I'm takin' time out just to figure out your heart now (Woah)
I'm feelin' different every time I hear your heart pound (That sound)
Automatic lovin' when we make them car sounds
I'ma beep-beep, go fast, I can't park 'round (Yeah)
Nobody that don't respect late-night talks and all sounds (Ayy, ayy)
That's from the Skybounds, I'm a good guy now (Huh, what?)
I'm no dog, no, no, I am no hound (No hounds)
Your beauty brighter than the light, like what is dark now? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
From dedication, I can't lie, it made you smart now (Yeah)
I took my shot and yeah, I missed, but got the rebound (Yeah)
Diamond so-so cool, got you high now (Ayy)

(There she go) Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go
Dirty dancin', both hands in the air, there she go
Make you stutter, make you stop and stare
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Ayy, woah)
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Ayy)
Hands in the air, there she go
Yeah, that's my baby right there, there she go (Damn, uh)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there she go (Yeah)
