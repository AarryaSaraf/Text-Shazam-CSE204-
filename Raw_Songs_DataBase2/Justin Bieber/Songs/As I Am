By myself sometimes, to give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts when I push your love away, I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies so your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

Sometimes I don't know why you love me
Sometimes I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"


A thousand miles apart, yeah, you're the one that holds my heart
It's no surprise, and I tell you all the time
And when life gets way too hard, I'll meet you in the stars, you know I will
I'll keep you near (Mmm), as I wipe away your tears (Mmm), yes


Sometimes I don't know why you love me
Sometimes I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"


Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
(Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere") {Yeah}
(Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can)
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"


You were there for me when I was actin' selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away (Yeah)
(You were there for me when I was actin' selfish)
And you (prayed for me when I was out of faith)
You (believed in me when ain't nobody else did)
(It's a miracle you didn't run away)


Sometimes I don't know why you love me
(Sometimes I don't know why you care)
Take me with the good and the ugly
{Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"}
