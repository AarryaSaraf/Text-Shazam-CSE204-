Be myself with you
Be myself with you
I can't be myself when you're not there, oh-woah-oh

La-la-la-la-la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you-ou-ou?
La-la-la-la-la-la, ten thousand faces
Still your eyes are the view-iew-iew

What can I do-ooh?
Oh, when the chances are of a billion stars, they can't compare to you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Nowhere to mo-ove
'Cause it's new to me, consumin' me, I might be scared of ya, oh, yeah

I could travel any place, but without you, it's just runnin' around
They could open Heaven's gates, but without you, I'm just stuck in the clouds (Yeah, yeah)

I can't be myself when you're not there (Yeah)
The sweetest dreams turn into nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there
Oh-woah-oh


{La-la-la-la-la-la}, I'm talkin' backwards
High on you, high on you-ou-ou-ou (Oh)
{La-la-la-la-la-la}, don't know what's after (No)
But I know it's with you-ou-ou-ou


What can I do-ooh?
Oh, when the chances are of a billion stars, they can't compare to you-ou-ou-ou (Yeah)
Nowhere to mo-ove
'Cause it's new to me, consumin' me, I might be scared of ya (I might be scared of ya), {oh, yeah}


I could travel any place, but without you, it's just runnin' around {Girl, I'm just runnin' around}
They could open Heaven's gates, but without you, I'm just stuck in the clouds (Yeah, yeah)


I can't be myself when you're not there (Oh)
The sweetest dreams turn into nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there (Be myself)
Oh-woah-oh

La-la-la-la-la-la, I feel amazing
How are you? How are you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou?

I can't be myself when you're not there (No, I can't)
The sweetest dreams turn into nightmares
I can't be myself when you're not there
Oh-woah-oh

Oh-woah-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Be myself with you)
Oh-oh-woah-ooh-woah-oh-oh (Be myself with you, when you're not in my arms)
I can't be myself when you're not there (I need you close)
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't be myself when you're not there
