Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down

You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti (Yeah)
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already (Yeah, ayy)
My bed is depressed (Depressed)
My pillow's a victim (Hmm, hmm)
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (B-O-I)

And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Hey)
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone

Hoppin' on the red-eye (Ha)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Hey, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh)

Got a new job, for a big bag
You better go get it
You'll be gone for a few days, posin' in the heat
I ain't gon' sweat it
I miss your distractions
My touch is in distress
You're just a plane ride away from my permanent visit

And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Only been an hour but I'm feelin' all alone

You should be hoppin' on the red-eye (Right now)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Right away)
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route (Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh)
See you when I touch down

(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah (Oh)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah (Hey)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah
See you when I touch down
(Hey)

Big bag (Oh)
Big, big
Big bag (Hey)
Big, big
Big bag (Oh)
(T-R-O-Y-B-O-I, oh)
