// Shake The Frost //

You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ole' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' to the pines
And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun

So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones

Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
Til' they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played

So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones

Darlin' will ya stay right here
And shake this frost off of my bones

// Deadman's Curve //

You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down

All the things you put me through
Safe to say I'm tired of you
Had our times, yeah we had a few
But where we gonna be when the pills run out

Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave

I reckon if I chose to stay
It'd be better for a few more days
But it the end it always rains
And honey, you can cause a storm

But I'm tired and soakin' wet
And hunkered over trying to catch my breath
Broke my back and did my best
To hold you through the shakes

But it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat

My heart was never much on games
Let alone the ones you play
I've only got one and it's already broken
So why you wanna throw it around

I wish I had the strength to go
But it's a long and hateful road
And I just now got to feelin' at home
And the frost you put on me

Where we gonna go when the dam breaks loose
And the white line fever gets a hold of you
How we gonna make it to higher ground
If you won't get up and leave

And it's hard to keep floatin' on foundered dream
You're takin' in water at crazy speed
How can I get to the shore on time
If you won't keep afloat

You can go to hell, my dear
You'd probably like it better there
With all them boys who thought they could make it
Deadman's curve gonna lay them down

// Charleston Girl //

Charleston girl in a darkened room
And you don't know her like I do
We took the fire escape to her room
And got stone-raging blind

Left my money in the trusting hands
Of them old Steel Brothers in a 'fastgrass' band
One day I'm gonna drive up there
And give them half my mind

I don't know if it's the wine or the coke
That makes her sound like her jaw is broke
She's working hard to make some sense
But she ain't got a dime

I wish to God that I could help her out
I wish I knew what she was talkin' bout
I wish to God that I could get away
But I'm way too drunk to drive

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why, but every time I cross that river, Lord
There's somethin' tears me up and makes me wild

Charleston girl with raven hair
Bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys
I'd try to drive away

I never planned to leave so soon
I didn't know that he was sweet on you
Go ahead and take her
Cause she ain't worth the time

All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leavin' West Virginia for a while
Don't know why but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild
