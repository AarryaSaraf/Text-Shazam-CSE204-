// Bottles And Bibles //

Bottles and bibles
Litter the floor
An all night revival
Passed out around 4

Now the preacher's been drinkin'
But it's hard not to do
Since she ran out the screen door
And swore they were through

Oh Lord, if you care, send a spirit down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do

He didn't believe her
He just knew she'd come home
But the nights kept a' crawlin'
As he laid there alone

And he'd call up to heaven
And he'd hope and he'd pray
But the line's always busy
Since he went astray

Oh Lord, if you care, won't you answer his prayers
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do

Now the bottles and bibles
Broke out in a fight
The whiskey fought hard, son
And took the victory that night

They found him a' layin'
Face down by the stairs
Dressed up for a sermon
Nobody would hear

Oh Lord, if you care, send your angels down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do

// Rock Salt And Nails //

By the banks of the river
Where the willows hang down
The wild birds they warble
With a low moanin' sound

Way down in the hollow
Where the river runs cold
It was there I first listened
To the lies that you told

Now I lie on my back
And I see your sweet face
The past I remember
Time can't erase

And the letters you wrote me
They were written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name

Now if the ladies were blackbirds
If the ladies were thrushes
Well I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly cold marshes

And if the women were squirrels
With them high bushy tails
Well I'd load up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails

I'd load up my shotgun
With rock salt and nails

// Coming Down //

Don't you wish that you could go back sometimes
Don't you wish that you could go back home
Tryin' to remember just where it was
Remember you ain't alone
Remember you ain't alone

Every day's another pointless job
And every night's another lonesome song
Tryin' to remember when your bed wasn't leather
And you were the one singin' along
Lord, where did we go wrong

Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til you can't hear the darkness call you

There was a good man in the makin' once
In the light of yesterday
Tryin' to remember just who he was
Tryin' like hell to recall his name
Well it used to be my name

Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til you can't hear the darkness call you

// Follow You To Virgie //

Back before these calloused hands and all this work
We used to sit up at the flats
Actin' like we'd live forever
Gettin' high and skippin' class

Yeah, I reckon we were heathens
But in her eyes we were saints
Now you're callin' all the boys home
'Cause heaven's angels carried her away

So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

Back when all us boys were tryin'
To make sense of all these strings
I can see her in the corner
Singin' along to all our crazy dreams

So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

I will follow you to Virgie
'Cause that's what us boys are for
To help you out when you get weary
And you can't go no more

And can't you see her up there, Cody
I can see her through the pines
Sayin' "Boys be good"
