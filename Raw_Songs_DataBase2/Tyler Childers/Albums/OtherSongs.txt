// A Song While You're Away //

Up in your nephew's room playing on his cousin's guitar
I wrote a song for you
You have done drove off with everything I need
My box and my tumbleweed

I picked it up on the way to Flagstaff years ago
I was hanging on to everything you had the grace to show

You were young and you were hungry
Lord knows I was hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Looking over the hill at the lights of your hometown
I wrote this song for you
Thinking of the way we met:
A girl home from school and a boy just passing through

I got a job as a cut man at a house just down the road
I had never been to town before and I didn't know a soul

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Agate white wedding dress
Turquoise on your ring
Upright bass and violin
As you walk the aisle to me

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

// Back Home //

I was meltin'
Through the box springs
I was drippin' on the floor
Watchin' the dark dance surplus
On another hotel door

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

I was hurlin'
[?]
I was swingin' ceiling fans
Cause and effect and towards
A cold and lonley man

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

Now I'm reachin' for the bottle
While I'm pouring over my phone
I'm throwing down the other
As I drain one to the bone

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

// Cane Break //

Bring me a beer
Get me too fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
With the last of my smokes, the last of my tears
She was a freight train made of gold
And she got the high ball and she was ready to go
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forevers a word that I seldom use

So I guess I'm to blame
For thinkin' she'd never leave
But I hope and I prayed
That wherever she is lord she thinks about me
Cuz I miss her like the wine
We drank while the fireworks covered the sky
And the radio sang out our tunes
We danced down the hill all the way to my room

So laugh in my face
Tell me that you told me so
But I'll tell you one truth
At least at the time I didn't feel so damn cold
She's a cane break, up in flames
You can't put her out and she burns through the rain
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forever's a word that I seldom use

So, bring me a beer
Get me too fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
With the last of my smokes

// Cinder And Smoke //

You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away

Well you see these boots I'm wearin'
They're tough enough to go
And they'll take any road to reach you
Honey won't you light the way

You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away

You see this train I'm ridin'
It's burnin' up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey won't you jump my train

You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away

// Her And The Banks //

Hair like the sun
And eyes just as green as the ridge line we'd walk
Scannin' the trees for the wave of a tail
A shake of the leaves
Lord I'd give the world for a sight of those things

Hands just as soft
As skin on the fruit
That breaks down the branch
'neath the bluest of moons
Lord we'd eat til we's sick
And grab all we could hold
Then we'd run through the yard
With the fruit that we'd stole

And her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good company wherever I go
When I'm smilin' it's her and the banks
The big sandy river that colors my face

Love just as strong
As Lawrence County shine
It'll mow ya right down
It'll make ya go blind
I would ruin my life
And use up all my pay
Just to have her tonight
Just her and the banks

Her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good company wherever I go
When I'm smilin' it's her and the banks
The big sandy river that colors my face

// Highway 40 Blues //

Well, these Highway Forty blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Counted the days since I've been gone
And I'd love to see the lights of home

Wasted time and money too
Squandered youth in search of truth
But in the end I had to lose
Lord above, I've paid my dues
Got the Highway Forty blues

The highway called when I was young
Told me lies of things to come
Fame and fortune lies ahead
That's what the billboard lights had said

Shattered dreams, my mind is numb
My money's gone, stick out my thumb
My eyes are filled with bitter tears
Lord, I ain't been home in years
Got the Highway Forty blues

You know, I've rambled all around
Like a rolling stone, from town to town
Met pretty girls I have to say
But none of them could make me stay

Well, I've played the music halls and bars
Had fancy clothes and big fine cars
Things a country boy can't use
Dixieland I sure miss you
Got the Highway Forty blues

// Honest Work //

Let's pack our bags and go to Florida for the winter
And meet ourselves some real nice folks
A little on the older side, and little on hope
We'll hold their hands as they walk across the street
Help 'em wipe their goddamn ass
And when they're all fast asleep, steal their medicine cabinet
Take it back home for the kids to go to school
Make enough damn dough to burn a wet bank mule
I'm in between jobs with nothing to do
Girl, it's vacation time

It's honest work, I mean it's honestly a hassle
Folks get madder than fire
If they catch you in the witching hour
Trying to steal their copper wire
But if we get it, got a cousin at the scrapyard
Aunt Betty raised a goddamn saint!
He always offers top dollar
He's always giving me a fair shake
We oughta save a little while we're still around
We gotta keep ourselves busy as we're coming down
And it sure beats diggin' underneath the ground
Savin' vacation time

Ain't hard, I taught Junior how to do it
And he's touched in the head, dark child
Blames it on the drug use, honey
What does he know anyhow?
Takes a little honest work
But pretty much cooks itself
I got a buddy on the mountain having
Trouble keepin' it on the shelf
And if we turn a profit, don't you worry, boo
We'll put a couple good snorts back for me and you
It'll keep you tweakin', keep ya going through
Til we get vacation time

// Jane //

Well she don't like it when I ain't sober
And I can't say that I blame her
I don't see how she takes it, boys
I don't how she takes it

And she done told me that it's all over
If I walk through the front door
Three sheets to the wind again
Three sheets to the wind

And I just laughed it off
How you gonna get back home?
If you ain't got a dime
And it don't come from me
And that's a long way to walk
And you ain't the ramblin' kind
So I just think it's best
If you decide to stay

Well those mountain women gonna get their way
Or they'll sure die of tryin'
I don't know why she tries so hard
I don't know why she tries
Cause us mountain fellas are awful stubborn
And we don't give a god damn
We don't give a damn
No we just don't care

And we can't get enough of all these neon nights
Barroom brawls and bedroom quarrels
And we come home too late
And it ain't nothin' new
And it's just the same ol' thing
And I work way too hard
To take this shit off Jane

Well she went down to the Western Union
Called her country cousin
I need to get back home right now
I need to get away
Cause it ain't funny when he ain't sober honey
Get me on a Greyhound
Get me on a Greyhound home
Get me to the hills

And I went out one night
Came home when the rooster crowed
And there weren't nothin' left but the smell of her perfume
Ain't never felt so small, ain't felt so much pain
And I'm just way too drunk
To take this shit off Jane

// Jersey Giant //

I remember all them summers
Playing 'til my fingers bled
You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with you
We'd get drunk and go to bed

Looking back at all them memories
Lord, I hate to sleep alone
But if you ever get the notion
That you need me, let me know

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon

I remember all them winters
Drinking Woodford 'til we drowned
We'd get wind about a party
Bundle up and go to town

Never worry 'bout the police
Never worried much at all
I miss those nights of reckless glory
I'd come back if you just called

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon

I left town when we were over
'Cause it didn't feel the same
Every backroad had a memory
And every memory held your name

'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
The one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warnings signs
But Lord, I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon

// Long Violent History //

It's the worst that it's been since the last time it happened
It's happening again right in front of our eyes
There's updated footage, wild speculation
Tall tales and hearsay and absolute lies

Been passed off as factual, when actually the actual
Causes they're awkwardly blocking the way
Keeping us all from enjoyin' our evening
Shoving its roots through the screens in our face

Now, what would you get if you heard my opinion
Conjecturin' on matters that I ain't never dreamed
In all my born days as a white boy from Hickman
Based on the way that the world's been to me?

It's called me belligerent, it's took me for ignorant
But it ain't never once made me scared just to be
Could you imagine just constantly worryin'
Kickin' and fightin', beggin' to breathe?

How many boys could they haul off this mountain
Shoot full of holes, cuffed and layin' in the streets
'Til we come into town in a stark ravin' anger
Looking for answers and armed to the teeth?

Thirty-ought-sixes, Papaw's old pistol
How many, you reckon, would it be, four or five?
Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Of tucking our tails as we try to abide?

Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Of tucking our tails as we try to abide?

// Messed Up Kid //

She likes stealin' from Salvation Armies
She says it makes her feel like the movies
Battin' her eyes with a crooked smile
Wonderin' why the hell I'm pissed

This ain't like any film that I recall
It ain't exactly The Italian Job
This kinda shit is for soccer moms
Dyin' to be young again

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah print body suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She tells me I got a problem with drinkin'
But loves going out on the weekends
Throws me the keys with a "pretty please"
And wonders if I'll drive her home

You'd think if she knew my weakness
She'd try and help me to beat it
That's why I love her so but since Roanoke
I don't take her out to shop no more

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah print body suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She likes stealin' from Salvation Armies
She says it makes her feel like the movies
Battin' her eyes with a crooked smile
Wonderin' why the hell I'm pissed

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah print body suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

She's dancin' around the room
In a cheetah print body suit
Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

Roll the credits when the scene is through
Of the story of a messed up kid

// My Woman //

My love is like the whippoorwill
She bellows out across the hills
Hits me where I need it son, keeps me up at night

She dances cross the threshing floor
O'er the grain till her feet are sore
And the men line up to lay her down
But she don't even see

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My woman loves just like a train
Eight and the sand through the pourin' rain
Takes a lot to wear her out
Buddy she could run for days

Looks my way and I get weak
Calls my name and I can't speak
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My love is like the gospel truth
Puts my hands to proper use
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away

She dances cross the bedroom floor
Shuts the blinds and locks the door
Always leaves me wantin' more each time she turns away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

// New Circle Road //

Crazy as hell
And hotter than fire
Brianna, won't you walk my way
Well I'd give you the world if I knew you weren't leavin'
The minute the band stops the music they play

Well I'm drunker than hell
And I'm young and I'm rowdy
I doubt I'll ever change
But I'd give it all up if the good Lord would let me
Stay here forever just watching you sway

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

I wish that the stars
Stayed out for ages
I'd sit right in this chair
Watching you dance for the boys and your wages
Lustin' in vain just like every boy here

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

When I was just a young boy
My momma told me, son
She said don't go chasin' night owls
Cause they'll leave you when mornin' comes

So the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

// Nose On The Grindstone //

Daddy worked like a mule mining Pike County coal
Til' he fucked up his back and couldn't work anymore
He said one of these days you'll get out of these hills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

See, the ways of this world will just bring you to tears
Keep the Lord in your heart and you'll have nothin' to fear
Live the best that you can and don't lie and don't steal
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Daddy I've been trying, I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord they bring me the chills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Keep in mind that a man's just as good as his word
It takes twice as long to build bridges you've burned
And there's hurt you can cause time alone cannot heal
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Well daddy I've been trying, I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord they bring me the chills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills
Keep your nose on the grindstone

// Oneida //

Back before birthdays were something she dreads
Back before children had settled her friends
Back when the radio spoke to her heart
Oh, girls they wanna have fun

I lay here awake and I laugh at her jokes
She is referencing movies I'm too young to know
And I'm letting her lead as we dance in the dark
Oh girl, I'm falling in love

Oneida, I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I've played my guitar
I've been working on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back and come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you

Pleading my case with the bro at the door
Buddy, I know we've been through this before
You can't let me go in but if I wait outside
Will you give her a message for me

Tell her, Oneida I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I'll bring my guitar
I've been working on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back and come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you

// Pray Over The Moonshine Still //

Well call up the reverend
Won't you get him up here now
That old gal won't get to work till every head is bowed

We got new copper wire
She's lookin' pretty nice
And we can't start the corn
Till we take it up with Christ

So pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still

Well mama needs a Maytag
And the babies all need shoes
But at the rate that we are goin'
We'll never see the blues

Our corporations boomin'
Were known both near and far
But if we're gonna reach the masses
We're gonna have to buy a car

But first pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still

They say that I'm a sinner
They say I'm bound for hell
But I know every baptist boy
And I know them very well

So if I don't reach glory
If I ride that long black train
Well I'll be in good company sippin' moonshine all the way

So pray o'er the moonshine still
Pray that the money rolls through them hills
We'll strike gold if it's your will
Just pray o'er the moonshine still

// Redneck Romeo //

Lexington's a city
But it ain't so big it freaks me out
And if I need a breather I can hit the parkway
Be home before the bars all close
And drink away the lies she told
And think about the days

She was a few rides shy of a rodeo queen
High school lovin' in a badass Jeep
Far from the eyes of a watchful town
Her mama didn't need to know
Good corn liquor to shake this cold
And good hot lovin' on a gravel road
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

When push came down to shove
I'd be a bandit for her love
Shoot sharp and walk away
She was good before she changed her name
And I bet that ain't all that's changed
Goddamn, I remember the nights

I was a young punk kid from a dried up town
Coal-car country full of huntin' hounds
She was the one who kept those boys at bay
Her high heels and my red wing boots
Cuttin' couches in the living room
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

I can't win for all this losin'
I can't see for all this boozin'
By God, I can keep it together
Just to hold my baby close
Get her movin' down a county road
Make up for lost time

She was a few rides shy of a rodeo queen
She ran on sex and gasoline
Far more money than a boy like me could hold
She went off to paint the town
And I'm stuck holdin' these mountains down
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

// Shoot Low Sheriff! //

Well, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Old Uncle Bill's got a still on a hill
He never worked a day and I guess he never will
He runs shine liquor and he sells it to Paw
It made Maw mad and she called the law

Well, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Maw put the sheriff on Uncle Bill's trail
Said, "Catch that sot and throw him in jail"
Run out on his wife with the little kids squallin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Yeah, you'd better shoot low, sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Uncle Bill held the bottle 'tween his finger and thumb
Said if I leave any, you can have some
Make him reach in his pocket for his last thin dime
And wear summer britches in the cold wintertime

Yeah, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'
Yeah, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

// Take My Hounds To Heaven //

Now you tell me that there are streets of gold and angels in the air
Now all that's fine and dandy and I'm sure it's nice up there
There's just one thing that I need to know 'fore I settle down
Can I take my hounds to heaven
Can I hunt on God's ground

Now you say if I quit drinking and try to toe the line
I can make it up to glory at the end of my life
Now whiskey's hard to throw away something I might try to do
If I could spend forever running round treeing coon's

But if I can't take my hound's to heaven
If I can't hunt on God's land
Then I'd rather load my dog box up and go to hell with all my friends
Now I'll wake up in the morning and follow you to town
If I can take my hounds to heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground

Now you say if I quit smoking and my rough and rowdy ways
We'd walk together forever on streets of gold someday
But the only way I can stand it now and I hate to say it's true
Is when you start your bitchin'
I can run off and hunt till my face turns blue

If I can't take my dogs to heaven
If I can't hunt on God's land
I'd rather load my dog box up and go to hell with all my friends
Now I'll wake up in the morning and follow you to town
If I can take my hounds to heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground
If I can take my hounds to heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground

// That Thing You Said //

Was it with your eyes
Was it with your tone
It won't leave me alone
Uneasy safety's on

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said

Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said

Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait all alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said

// Woodward Creek //

I've ran around
And I've seen a thing or two
Leave that highway black and blue
With the will beneath my feet

And I can tell ya now
Them girls and the whole delight
The way you look tonight, smilin' back at me

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I got kin
Up north where the wind blows cold
We'll leave tomorrow
Stay drunk for a few good days
When we've spent every dime I've worked to save
We can pack it up
Come back to woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I've got plans
That'll take me far from Irvine
But if I could, Lord knows I'd love to stay
We've got time 'fore I leave these mountains
One more night on the banks of woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

// Yes I Guess They Oughta Name A Drink After You //

Oh I get drunk most every night
Seems like all we do is fight
The more I drink the less I feel blue
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool
Spendin' my life on an old bar stool
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you

If this date were to be our last
I'd never sit down this glass
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you
You've left my heart a vacant lot
I'll fill it with another shot
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you

Looks like I had my fill
Guess I better pay my bill
When I started out I only meant to have a few
Someone just said that you left town
I better get a double round
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
Yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
