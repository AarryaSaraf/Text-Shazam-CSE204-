Lexington's a city
But it ain't so big it freaks me out
And if I need a breather I can hit the parkway
Be home before the bars all close
And drink away the lies she told
And think about the days

She was a few rides shy of a rodeo queen
High school lovin' in a badass Jeep
Far from the eyes of a watchful town
Her mama didn't need to know
Good corn liquor to shake this cold
And good hot lovin' on a gravel road
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

When push came down to shove
I'd be a bandit for her love
Shoot sharp and walk away
She was good before she changed her name
And I bet that ain't all that's changed
Goddamn, I remember the nights

I was a young punk kid from a dried up town
Coal-car country full of huntin' hounds
She was the one who kept those boys at bay
Her high heels and my red wing boots
Cuttin' couches in the living room
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?

I can't win for all this losin'
I can't see for all this boozin'
By God, I can keep it together
Just to hold my baby close
Get her movin' down a county road
Make up for lost time

She was a few rides shy of a rodeo queen
She ran on sex and gasoline
Far more money than a boy like me could hold
She went off to paint the town
And I'm stuck holdin' these mountains down
Juliet
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?
Won't you crawl outside your window
And dance in the arms of your redneck Romeo?
