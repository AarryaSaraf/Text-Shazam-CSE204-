My love is like the whippoorwill
She bellows out across the hills
Hits me where I need it son, keeps me up at night

She dances cross the threshing floor
O'er the grain till her feet are sore
And the men line up to lay her down
But she don't even see

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My woman loves just like a train
Eight and the sand through the pourin' rain
Takes a lot to wear her out
Buddy she could run for days

Looks my way and I get weak
Calls my name and I can't speak
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go

My love is like the gospel truth
Puts my hands to proper use
Gets me through the loneliness
Takes the blues away

She dances cross the bedroom floor
Shuts the blinds and locks the door
Always leaves me wantin' more each time she turns away

Honey take my hand
Take me home
And if the good Lord comes to fetch me
Then he knows just where to go
