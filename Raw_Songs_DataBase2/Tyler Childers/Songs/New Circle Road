Crazy as hell
And hotter than fire
Brianna, won't you walk my way
Well I'd give you the world if I knew you weren't leavin'
The minute the band stops the music they play

Well I'm drunker than hell
And I'm young and I'm rowdy
I doubt I'll ever change
But I'd give it all up if the good Lord would let me
Stay here forever just watching you sway

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

I wish that the stars
Stayed out for ages
I'd sit right in this chair
Watching you dance for the boys and your wages
Lustin' in vain just like every boy here

But the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road

When I was just a young boy
My momma told me, son
She said don't go chasin' night owls
Cause they'll leave you when mornin' comes

So the time has come for the club to close
I'll go my way and you'll go home
With the money you've earned and the hearts you stole
Up on the stage down on new circle road
