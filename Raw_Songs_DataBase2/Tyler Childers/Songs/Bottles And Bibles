Bottles and bibles
Litter the floor
An all night revival
Passed out around 4

Now the preacher's been drinkin'
But it's hard not to do
Since she ran out the screen door
And swore they were through

Oh Lord, if you care, send a spirit down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do

He didn't believe her
He just knew she'd come home
But the nights kept a' crawlin'
As he laid there alone

And he'd call up to heaven
And he'd hope and he'd pray
But the line's always busy
Since he went astray

Oh Lord, if you care, won't you answer his prayers
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do

Now the bottles and bibles
Broke out in a fight
The whiskey fought hard, son
And took the victory that night

They found him a' layin'
Face down by the stairs
Dressed up for a sermon
Nobody would hear

Oh Lord, if you care, send your angels down here
Cause the preacher's been drinkin' again

But it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow
When everybody in town points a finger at you
But they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled
They don't know you at all, but they think that they do
