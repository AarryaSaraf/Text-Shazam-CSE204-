Was it with your eyes
Was it with your tone
It won't leave me alone
Uneasy safety's on

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said

Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said

Crippled up inside
Without a place to hide
I sit and I wait all alone
Tryin' to make it
Leave me alone

That thing you said
It's all bottled up and spinnin' in my head
Can't escape it in my bed
That thing you said... That thing you said
