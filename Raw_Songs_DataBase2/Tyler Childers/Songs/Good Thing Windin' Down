Don't hold me
If you don't mean it
'Cause I'm tired of waistin' my time on things set on leavin'
Don't kiss me
If it really hurts you
Though I can't see how you could change after all that we've been through

I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight

In my dreams
We're always laughin'
But I wake up to find that that very rarely happens
So go on and leave me
If it'd really please you
You'll be hard pressed to find you a man that will treat you like I do

But I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight
