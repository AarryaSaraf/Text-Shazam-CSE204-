They got my favorite lotion here
Something in a hotel I admire
I got the pictures that you sent me
How they fill me with desire

Tonight we've all got our own rooms
I'm about to burn mine down
Because I miss you somethin' fierce
In this quaint New England town

I read the texts you whispered plain
Everything you aim to do
Sure do like the way you think
That's the way I'm thinking too

I see it play out in my mind
You and I unite as one
The van don't leave 'til 10 A.M
And we've only just begun

This one here goes out to you
Lord wherever you may be
When you're reaching for a fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand

For a moment you were here
Moment passed and you were gone
Didn't even clean the mess
That you clearly helped to cause

When the boys asked how I slept
I'll just look 'em in the eye
Tell them all you'd come to visit
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night

This one here goes out to you
Lord wherever you may be
When you're reaching for a fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand

It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand
