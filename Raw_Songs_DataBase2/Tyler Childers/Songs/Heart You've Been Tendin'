All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

Ain't no way to fake it
No way around it
No time to tear it
And there ain't no excuse

And it ain't that hard
When you get down to it
Only tool that you'll need
Only one that you'll use

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

Now hearts they can wilt
When they're left in the window
Without any shade
From the sun beatin' down

And they ain't maintained and kept in water
But it's the only thing that you'll take to the ground

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

It'll show in your stride and the songs you been singin'
It'll give you some pride and then further along
When you've left it all
It can help someone else get back to their home

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
