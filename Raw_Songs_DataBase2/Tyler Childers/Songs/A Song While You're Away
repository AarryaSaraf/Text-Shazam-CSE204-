Up in your nephew's room playing on his cousin's guitar
I wrote a song for you
You have done drove off with everything I need
My box and my tumbleweed

I picked it up on the way to Flagstaff years ago
I was hanging on to everything you had the grace to show

You were young and you were hungry
Lord knows I was hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Looking over the hill at the lights of your hometown
I wrote this song for you
Thinking of the way we met:
A girl home from school and a boy just passing through

I got a job as a cut man at a house just down the road
I had never been to town before and I didn't know a soul

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times

Agate white wedding dress
Turquoise on your ring
Upright bass and violin
As you walk the aisle to me

I was young and I was hungry
Lord knows you were hungry too
We were both flat-out starving
For something worthwhile to lose
You were my bread and I was your honey
Up against the dark red wine
Trying to hold on to the lovely
Through the bitter of our times
