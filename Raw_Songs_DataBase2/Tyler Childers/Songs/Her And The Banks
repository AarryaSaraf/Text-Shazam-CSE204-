Hair like the sun
And eyes just as green as the ridge line we'd walk
Scannin' the trees for the wave of a tail
A shake of the leaves
Lord I'd give the world for a sight of those things

Hands just as soft
As skin on the fruit
That breaks down the branch
'neath the bluest of moons
Lord we'd eat til we's sick
And grab all we could hold
Then we'd run through the yard
With the fruit that we'd stole

And her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good company wherever I go
When I'm smilin' it's her and the banks
The big sandy river that colors my face

Love just as strong
As Lawrence County shine
It'll mow ya right down
It'll make ya go blind
I would ruin my life
And use up all my pay
Just to have her tonight
Just her and the banks

Her love makes me feel like I'm home
Keeps me good company wherever I go
When I'm smilin' it's her and the banks
The big sandy river that colors my face
