Daddy worked like a mule mining Pike County coal
Til' he fucked up his back and couldn't work anymore
He said one of these days you'll get out of these hills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

See, the ways of this world will just bring you to tears
Keep the Lord in your heart and you'll have nothin' to fear
Live the best that you can and don't lie and don't steal
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Daddy I've been trying, I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord they bring me the chills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Keep in mind that a man's just as good as his word
It takes twice as long to build bridges you've burned
And there's hurt you can cause time alone cannot heal
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills

Well daddy I've been trying, I just can't catch a break
There's too much in this world I can't seem to shake
But I remember your words, Lord they bring me the chills
Keep your nose on the grindstone and out of the pills
Keep your nose on the grindstone
