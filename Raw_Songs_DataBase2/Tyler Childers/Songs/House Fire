You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see these boots I'm wearing?
They're tough enough to go
And they will take many roads to reach you
Honey, won't you light the way?

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see this train I'm riding?
It's burning up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey, won't you jump my train?

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You could set my house on fire, baby
