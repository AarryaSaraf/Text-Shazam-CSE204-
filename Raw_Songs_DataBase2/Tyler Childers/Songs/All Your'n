Drivin' through the roadwork
Oh the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like memories
Of the miles we shared between

The place you learned to say your prayers
The place I took to prayin'
Loadin in and breakin down
My road dog door deal dreams

Long before we ever met
I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half
Of half that I'm sure of now

Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd a gone about it
Follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn I wanna taste with you

The goddess in my Days Inn pen
The muse I aint' refusin'
The part of me that ain't around
I'm always talkin' to

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

No there ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' about it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine
