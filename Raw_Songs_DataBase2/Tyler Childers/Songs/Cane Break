Bring me a beer
Get me too fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
With the last of my smokes, the last of my tears
She was a freight train made of gold
And she got the high ball and she was ready to go
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forevers a word that I seldom use

So I guess I'm to blame
For thinkin' she'd never leave
But I hope and I prayed
That wherever she is lord she thinks about me
Cuz I miss her like the wine
We drank while the fireworks covered the sky
And the radio sang out our tunes
We danced down the hill all the way to my room

So laugh in my face
Tell me that you told me so
But I'll tell you one truth
At least at the time I didn't feel so damn cold
She's a cane break, up in flames
You can't put her out and she burns through the rain
And she warned me before I took off my boots
She said forever's a word that I seldom use

So, bring me a beer
Get me too fucked to walk
And I'll crawl out of here
With the last of my smokes
