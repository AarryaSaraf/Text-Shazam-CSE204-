Well it all seemed so happy
But how can that be?
When there's a whole class of people
Just as lonesome as me

You asked me to tell you
How I can be so blue?
But you'd be the same
If the girl of your dreams
Broke your heart in two

So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Brother, what can I say?
I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away

Ol' KG's my buddy
We go way back
To the times back in high school
When I was too poor for Jack

But even he knows that sometimes
You can't help right the wrongs
By gettin' stoned blind
You need to sit down and pine
To a Hank Sr song

So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Brother what can I say?
You know I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away

Well I hope that she's happy
And I hope that she's free
I hope she finds her a man
To treat her like a queen

And then up out of nowhere
When she needs him around
She wakes up to find
She's ran out of time, and he's ran out of town

I hope she needs her a Hank song
To ease her pain
Because it'll help to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Honey what can I say?
I hope you feel like a Hank song
One of these days
