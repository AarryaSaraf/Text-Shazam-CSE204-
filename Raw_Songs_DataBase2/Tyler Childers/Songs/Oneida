Back before birthdays were something she dreads
Back before children had settled her friends
Back when the radio spoke to her heart
Oh, girls they wanna have fun

I lay here awake and I laugh at her jokes
She is referencing movies I'm too young to know
And I'm letting her lead as we dance in the dark
Oh girl, I'm falling in love

Oneida, I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I've played my guitar
I've been working on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back and come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you

Pleading my case with the bro at the door
Buddy, I know we've been through this before
You can't let me go in but if I wait outside
Will you give her a message for me

Tell her, Oneida I know that I'm younger than most
But I'm willing if you've got the time
To buy us some wine
I'll bring my guitar
I've been working on learning that song you've been dying to sing
About weddings and rings
I'll strum in the back and come in where I can harmonize on a line or two
But this song's all you
