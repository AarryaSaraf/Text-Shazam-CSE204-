I was raised in the house of a real holy roller warnin' people bout the ways of the sin
He said go out out yonder to the water and travel cause disciples they fishers and men
Yeah disciples they were fishers and men

So I got me a job on the first boat rowin' and it's been a mighty long time
Since I sat in the house of my father and my mother or I seen that woman of mine
Yeah that good lovin' gal of mine

I said babe I'm a'goin' on a little bitty journey I'll be back when the fishin' is through
While I'm away make haste to get ready for when Jesus comes for you
When the good lord comes for you
When Jesus comes for you, here it comes

Sayin' shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god

Truth it lies in the love of a woman lord don't sink this boat
I got a pretty little thing waiting in New Orleans with a dagger buy her throat
And she don't wanna do it but she's that crazy and if I don't make it back
She'll probably die alone and cold as the Creole night turns black

Sayin' shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god

Shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god
