If He knows how it feels to be beginnin' and the end
I reckon He knows the feelin' 'tween the now and then
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place friend
Lord, won't you help me carry my load?

I borrowed me a hammer, I swung it for a dime
I got to where I finally could afford me mine
But in between the swingin' and the idle time
I got to thinkin' heavy on the road

Now I'm hid out in the upper room
With walls so thin I could bust right through
Give all my buddies a ramblin' to
About the shit that really blows my mind

Back when I was younger, I didn't have a clue
Come to think of it I still doubt I do
But every now and then I get to thinkin'
"You know, I've got it all worked out."

I used to take my time and burn it in a bong
Iced down with the lights turned off
And somethin' in the speakers I could ponder on
Somethin' I could mull around

Now I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Check one-two can y'all hear me?
The sights are somethin' but they ain't for free
Lookin' at 'em wired for sound

The road goes on forever, the party it will tend
To run forever if ya never let it end
I got a part of me that's wonderin' when
I'll finally kick the urge to roam

Part of me just wants to live forever on the road
Split me down the middle, ship my southpaw home
If she gets to askin' tell her you don't rightly know
What happened to the rest of me

Aw, weep no more, girl don't cry
Hellfire ya married you a Gemini
This is the half of him you always liked
Looky here his heart still beats
