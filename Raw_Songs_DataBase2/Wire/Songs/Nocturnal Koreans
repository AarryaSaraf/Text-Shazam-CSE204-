I dressed and I showered
Before I awoke
I was fit for one purpose
I was going for broke
I brushed out my trail
Concealed my advance
Changing wheels often
There'd be no second chance

Do you think you are able
Of finding your way?

Bipolar opps met
Under sodium lamps
Five miles out from
The runway ramp
Drug impaired drivers
Lost in the woods
Believe sea-burnt nurses
Never tasted so good!

Um-um-um-um-um-um
Um-um-um-um-um!

Nocturnal Koreans
Are walking the halls
They missed their connection
They're climbing the walls
Cracker barrel kids
And their cracker barrel folks
Beavis and Butthead...
Thro' their cracker barrel jokes!

Her-her-her-her-her-her
Her-her-her-her-her
