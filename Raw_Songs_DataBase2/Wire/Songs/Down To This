Replaying accidents
Deploying precedents
Before the trial by fire
The evidential weight
The lens that can't create
The signal stretched on wire

Before you know it's
Taken hold it's coming down to this again
Before we know we're
Running scared it's coming down to this again

Fragmented symmetry
A tarnished history
A haunted youth in fear
No guiding principle
Coded invincible
No heaven far from here

Before you know it's
Taken hold it's coming down to this again
Before we know we're
Running scared it's coming down to this again

All I know is, time will waste us all
Time will fade us all from sight
In between clouds, spirit moves us on
Stretching time across the night
