With colour in your life there's a reason to explode
To set the world on fire
To skid and leave the road
In a black and white life there's a column of smoke
You don't burst into flame, you stop
When you're broke

In vitrio in vivo
The revolution's begun
In vitrio in vivo

In a star-filled world the full moon crosses the sun
Four minutes up
Two million's gone
And bang: he invades
The son of a gun, the son
Of a gun

The chemical defeater saved the elephant's life
A wild type junk genie
With a car-bra heaven wide
And bang, he invades
The son of a gun, the son
Of a gun
