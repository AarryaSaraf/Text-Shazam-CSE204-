Reliable, reliable witness

In the room full of tame Mary's
It's hard to find the truth
If you ask me, "Is this normal?"
I'll say, "I've got the proof"

In the room full of tame Mary's
It's hard to find the truth
If you ask me, "Is it normal?"
You'll find me on the roof
(Searching for the truth)

Get on parade, a full display
Heed the warning, please don't delay
A shading of eyes, a turning of heads
A dig in the shallows, a collection of lead
