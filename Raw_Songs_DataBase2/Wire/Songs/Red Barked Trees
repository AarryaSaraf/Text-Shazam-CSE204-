Find yourself in opposition
Rid yourself of superstitions
Deploy a mask, get night time vision
Safety off, get in position

A mother's guilt, a daughter's pain
The father failed to take the blame
The search is on, in southern seas
To find the healing, red barked trees

A day of pain, of push and shove
A hidden strength in velvet gloves
Sky writing planes sketch oaths above
In graphic loops an act of love

Traders rampage, on the loose
Dealers howl and hurl abuse
The market growls it eats the weak
Buys children farms in busy streets

A privileged few, a charmed elite
Can slash and burn as they retreat
The search is on, in southern seas
To find the healing, red barked trees
