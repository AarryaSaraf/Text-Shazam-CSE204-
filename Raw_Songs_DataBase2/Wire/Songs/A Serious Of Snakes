It looks serious
Is that a paper I see in your hand?
Then a pause for a German phrase
"Nie weider nie weider, nie weider nie weider"
Never again, none of your lip, y'tulip
Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued snake
I'd rather make furniture than go to midnight mass

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

He's a genius in research, I simply fell in love
I've got your ZIP code
Over there U.S.A., green turbaned angels
Annex the right bank
Baby, in a shambolic sideshow
They abandoned the baby
The baby trained, baby returns
Baby kills Mary and Joseph

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

Talk about laughing, I might have defeated cancer or so they say
Electrocuted, I was transformed into a foot soldier of the good general
Passionate for knights in the heart of ancient Persia
Fearless to go forth, fearless to adapt then blow to pieces

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

Please send your god my very best wishes
Does he still sing?
Does he still fish?
Does he still help you on your days off?
Don't stop that dripping
I prefer the old tortures
It's only when you stop that I feel it

Y'tulip, y'pea brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver tongued
Snake

When you lose the ship, it's like losing a part of you
I have a sense of my exposure, it's all on the neg
I try to use two instead of three, ah, but I have secrets
And there's a story in me, it starts

Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot...
