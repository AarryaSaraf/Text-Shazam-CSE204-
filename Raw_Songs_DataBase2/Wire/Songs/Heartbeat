I feel icy
I feel cold
I feel old
Is there something there behind me?
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime
I'm sublime

I feel empty
I feel dark
I remark
I am mesmerised
By my own beat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
In its own beat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
Like a heartbeat
