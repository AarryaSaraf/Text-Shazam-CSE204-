Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows
Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're captivating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're charged and waiting
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're celebrating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're hesitating

Slow so slow and so it grows
And so it shows and so it grows
And so it's slow so slow it grows
It's slow it shows for those who grow

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're fascinating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're scintillating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if your breath's escaping
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if it makes you happy
