I didn't see it coming
I was taken by surprise
There was something in the air
But I failed to read the signs

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies

Didn't see the bigger picture
Failed to read between the lines
Your agenda, you had hidden
In my blue and cloudless sky

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies
