I hire an idiot to flood
A canvas in a riot of red
I hire an idiot to flood
A canvas in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy heartache in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy jaundice in a riot of red

In the colour of the red bull
I envelop you
Whilst more red planes they still fly east
I envelop you

Ooo, up to the sun shall go
Thy heartache in a riot of red
Up to the sun shall go
Thy jaundice in a riot of red
May this person go unscathed
And be free of yellow colour
May this person go unscathed
And be free of yellow colour

In the colour of the red bull
I envelop you
Whilst more red planes still fly east
I envelop you

After a dawn of anxious waiting
To swim in the streets is scintillating
