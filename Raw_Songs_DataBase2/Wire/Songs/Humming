Spy the Russians
Brushing scandals
Under oligarchy rugs

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

Scope the bushes
Rustling longhorns
In a dust-cloud, Texan fog

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

Sinal dredges
Fashion wedges
At all end by vacuum fills

I can't quite remember
When it went wrong
Someone was humming
A popular song

I've been wronged in rumor
Got to do with lies, no
From the Rockies to Chicago
From free zone to no-go
