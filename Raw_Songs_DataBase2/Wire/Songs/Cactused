The collective hive-mind
Algorithmically scanning
Defending exploration
And language hair extensions

You'd better watch your step
You shouldn't place your bet
You may have played your hand
You didn't gauge demand
It's a throw-down
It's a tag-team angle
It's a face-off
Then a cheap shot low blow

Figuratively speaking
The meaning: quite porous
You are well-versed in verses
And chorus the chorus

Cactused informants
Scaling involvement
Discard new litanies
Deride conventions
