Love bends the earth, it straightens the road
It dives for pearls, it lightens the load

Love bends the rules, making good out of bad
Opens your eyes, helping you understand

Love bends are worst, drive you out of your mind
Stop you from eating, losing track of all time

Love bends are cursed, strike you down from behind
Give you night vision, makes you soft, make you kind

Love bends are bad, they quicken the blood
They make you better, they make you feel good
