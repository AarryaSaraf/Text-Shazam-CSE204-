Doubting Thomas parks his car in his Sunday best
Taps his wallet, straightens tie, lights a cigarette

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

Through the door he scans the bar, then a space appears
His drink is poured, for he is numb, the service it starts here

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

He sees it in the barmaid's face, a winning smile's caress
A million eyes in public stalk, the queue up to confess

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

Lost causes, loves, hates and shames, old battles fought and won
Bad debts, bad tips, the graveyard song, the dreamers talk in tongues

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

Haloes swarm, the air is thin, thick smoke in tights of blue
Elvis has a wooden heart, eyes dart across the room

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

Empty heads and stomachs full, the ashtrays overflow
Drinks are raised and voices praise good deeds of long ago

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

He drains his glass and makes a sign, the Virgin Queen appears
The Prince King needs a tender touch, his sacred heart knows no fear

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

Upon a cloud on optic shrine, he can't control his tears
On his knees, hands held in prayer, a practice lapsed for years

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

The altar clears, the light grows dim, the sanctus bell is rung
A miracle at closing time, our lady holds her son

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end

The faithful come to celebrate the vision Thomas saw
A rail now stands around the spot where Thomas... kissed the floor

Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
Pilgrim's progress, no journey's end
Which way Michael?
