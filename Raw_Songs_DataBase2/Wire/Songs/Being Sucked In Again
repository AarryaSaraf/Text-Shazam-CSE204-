A dorsal fin breaks the water
Salted meat, a sullen relapse
Inference drawn from every word

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked

Feeling numbed from anaesthetised flesh
Avoid disgrace, ideas still fresh
The gaping mouth, a fishwife's dream

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked

Bound and gagged, your labour's saved
The cost minute, the rules are waived
No hand, no step, your labour's in vain

Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked, being sucked in again
Being sucked
