Hearts are tried
In the intermission
Rien a voir
Only indecision

A tried heart popcorn
In the intermission
A tightening corner where no one belongs

Desole
In the intermission
The silent ones
Waiting for decisions

The bomb has landed
On the deputation?
Where's the rack across your back?
Scratching a living
