The windy city swallows corn
Volcanic princess brings a storm
Count me out, I love the spring
Curdled creams another thing
Heaven's open, there's no space
For a future Afghan ace
Testosterone plus, and gym built strong
The meat is off, gravity blonde

A heavy elder mans the door
Working girls, man, man the floor
They scope the room, enhance the groove
Teaching aliens shamanic moves
It's in your face that dumb arse smile
Not worth a piss, ain't got no style
The white kids are a crying shame
They've got it all but parked their brains
