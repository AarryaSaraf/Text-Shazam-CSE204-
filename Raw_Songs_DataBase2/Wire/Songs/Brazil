It's true darling, I'll walk you home
I'll be your date forever
I love you girl, I love you
Until they split the atom

So many times, there's nothing left
There's nothing left at all
I know I'm right 'cause when you're gone
There's nothing left at all

Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right, oh
Salute
