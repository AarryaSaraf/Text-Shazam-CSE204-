The consequences are mainly underrated
Flat glasses full, the prize inflated
Sharpen the weapons of your trade
To endure, as well as you gave
Spinning often, in a trance
The surface smooth, don't take the chance

Aqua plane in torrent pelt, skid across MacAdam's belt
Was it a miracle? That's how it felt

Launch into attractive space, falling from that pure state of grace
52 feet per sec per sec per sec per sec

To free my mind and break my neck
