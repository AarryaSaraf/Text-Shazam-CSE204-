Fun in the manscape
It's coming apart
The soul is for hire
And they've sold the heart
Operate the radar
Hit the switches
Try to find a way to live
Please by the brochure

Life in the manscape
It's part of the deal
The pope of pop
Drives a church of steel
Deep pile acquaintances
Hollow after dinner
Accommodate inflation
Nervous fingers on the trigger

Love in the manscape
Guaranteed real
You feel what you pay
And you pay what you feel
Unfamiliar letters
Anagram situations
Silence please!
Poets at work

Free speech and more TV
Distribute liberally
I'd like mine to be
A true facsimile
