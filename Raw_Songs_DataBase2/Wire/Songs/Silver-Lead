Unholy wisdom, stupid hung
Emptiness compressed your lungs
Strung up for strategic leaks
Swaying strong, the taut rope creaked

Gathering clouds anoint the dead
Mass of rooster, silver/lead

Erase the past and change the sheets
Turn the screws and pawn the weak
Abandoned! Can't afford to keep
The punch is spiked and words are cheap

Gathering clouds anoint the dead
Mass of rooster, silver/lead
