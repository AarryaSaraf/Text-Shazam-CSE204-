With all the front and more besides
Bitch, thrust, and parry and a few asides
With considerable charm
You chose not to decide

I really like you becomes my massage
I really want you becomes my message
And how long can we sustain ourselves apart?
The pressure's increasing, it squeezes my heart

I bought a ticket, you took a walk
So much to say, we're unable to talk
Suffering in silence, our eyes give it away
So close as we part, a touching display
Colouring my thoughts, predominately grey and

Fighting bravely
Oh, will she save me?
From what or who
I do not know
