Please take your knife
Out of my back
And, when you do
Please don't twist it
I felt the stab in my blind side
A poisoned blade to paralyse
A cosh of cash, a net of drink
To anodise, no longer think, so
Please take your knife
Out of my back
And when you do
Please don't twist it

Fuck off out of my face
You take up too much space
Move! You're blocking my view
I've seen far too much of you

Please take your knife
Out of my back
And, when you do
Please don't twist it
I won't hear another word
Another sugared lie
I won't be a part of your
Latest alibi, so
Please take your knife
Out of my back
And when you do
Please don't twist it
