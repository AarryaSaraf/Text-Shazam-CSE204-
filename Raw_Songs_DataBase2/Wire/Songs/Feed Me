What's the point
It's your table
I alter my altar
For every mouthful
You're unable
For every mouthful
I hunger

Feed me
Ooh, feed me

Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ooh, feed me
Ooh, feed me

Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by in inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ooh, feed me
Feed me
Ooh, feed me

How fast do you run?
How fast can you run?
