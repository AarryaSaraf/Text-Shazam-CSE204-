Are you scoping the future?
Are you scouting the trail?
Are you opening the door?
Are you female and male?
Are you groomed for success?
Are you expecting to fail?
Are you digging in deep?
Do you intend to prevail?

A three hundred and sixty?
First class degree deal?
Are you primed?
Are you ready?
Re-inventing the wheel?

One way or another
Are you ready to bail?
Are you muddled or puzzled?
And all that it entails
Are you feeling quite smart?
Are you hiding your tail?
Are you facing extinction?
Are you under full sail?
