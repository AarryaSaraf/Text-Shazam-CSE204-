Wakened from a living sleep, demons rise up
Violent tremors, aftershocks. Toys are banished
Attempts to vanish, all had failed

Broke your heart, blew your brain out
No wholly grail for staunch believers

Brave the nights, face your fears: hidden, passive years
Deep inside my time lock fog, faith and god were lost
Abandoned, enveloping smoke

Tears fell where there was no hope
No wholly grail for staunch believers
