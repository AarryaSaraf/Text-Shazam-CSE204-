// In The Art Of Stopping //

Trust me
Trust me
Believe me

Believe me
Don't trust me
Don't trust me
Believe me

Believe me

It's all in the art
It's all in the art
It's all in the art
It's all in the art of stopping

Trust me
Trust me
Believe me

Believe me
Trust me
Trust me
Believe me

It's all in the art
It's all in the art
It's all in the art
It's all in the art of stopping

// Mr Marx's Table //

It's a long long climb
It's the wrong wrong time
It's a bad bad sign
You have crossed the line
You have crossed the line

You have come a long way
For such a short stay
And I'm sad to say
It's too late to pray
It's too late to pray
...

// Being Watched //

You're a voyeur junkie, you're a problem boy
The peeping Toms regard you as their toy
The keyboard cowboys have stolen your voice
You'd like to give it up but you haven't got a choice

You've got a morbid fascination and a twisted view
You want big brother to spy on you
The trouble is (and you know it's true)
You like to be watched and be the watcher, too
You tap your Morse from your specimen jar
You are the audience, you are the star

You like to be watched and be the watcher, too

You've got mail - you'd better read it or you will become detached
And you wouldn't want that
Would you?

You like to be watched and be the watcher, too

// Comet //

It's coming fast
It's a comet
Coming this way
With your name on it
It's a heaven-sent
Extinction event

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
Then a whimper

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes

// The Agfers Of Kodack //

Nest in a bird, an enemy flew in
Fashion a life out of audio ruin
Farmers of God, is it good what you're doing?
Chanting a curse whilst religiously chewing

Is it time to repair? Is it time for unlocking?
To the shrine of the nomads, the pilgrims are flocking
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings

Hearing the cheering of mothers and daughters
There's change in the air and a shortage of water
A bounty is posted, conditions: no quarter
Don't bargain with fish which are still in the water

A love of the camera; a stomach for slaughter
Fresh from the front: our favourite reporter
The risks are increasing, she'd hang if they caught her
The odds on survival grow shorter and shorter...

Is it time to repair? Is it time for unlocking?
To the shrine of the nomads, the pilgrims are flocking
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings

// Nice Streets Above //

Nice streets, such nice streets, such nice streets above...

// Spent //

Experts in paradise, religious extremism
Toxic stimulation, enforced radiation
Fail safe, cut price, quick save, quick fix
Bostik, headfix-speedy guzzle, licks lips
Signal, ratio-whores and Byrons everywhere
Reject, fundraiser, well spent parasite
Cool jerk, widow-work, punk chaser and a tango
Rich lice, avarice, brutalised and mummified
Lifeless, limelight, ape man, keep your hair on
Ten years later, kill your poor and break them up

Rancid battery acid: fuel for dirty minds
Two-piece generator, neither art or science
Empty distillery, who's the hero tonight?
Sceptic industry, fucked it just for spite

Spent...

Flaccid cat, hairy assets, cool fur, 30, blind
Deep space simulator, needs a sex appliance
Tempted by symmetry, threw a certain dice
Septic hugging tree, sucked its crust for spit

Spent...

// Read & Burn //

Read
And
Burn
And

You
Never
Know
Never

They can
They might
They can
They will

// You Can't Leave Now //

The dogs wait in the street
Sensing fresh meat
It's time they were fed
Even though you're as good as dead
You know you have to go
But your movements are too slow

You've eaten your way through
The whole menu
You've savoured every thrill
But haven't paid the bill
And you can't leave now

Your options have run out
Leaving you on your own

You've eaten your way through
The whole menu
You've savoured every thrill
But haven't paid the bill
And you can't leave now

// Half Eaten //

The world is half-eaten
Mother Nature is nearly beaten
And the signs are everywhere
My DJ can't mix it
And God can't fix it
Because his plane is already in the air

The temperature is rising
It isn't surprising
The fires are everywhere
There won't be any water
The winters are getting shorter
I'd like to leave
But have not got the fare

// 99.9 //

Faith never skirted sense
Man has a wooden master
Chewing makes you anxious
Monkey neglected the needle

Pulsating Venus popped my sonar
Accorded temptation by symmetry
In event of lightning striking twice
The road ahead looks quite uncertain...
