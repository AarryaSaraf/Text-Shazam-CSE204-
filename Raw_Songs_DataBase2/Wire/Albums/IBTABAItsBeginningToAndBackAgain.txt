Album: IBTABAItsBeginningToAndBackAgain

// Over Theirs //

Something snapped, over and over
Something snapped, over the horizon
Something burst, over and over
Something burst, just out of sight

Like a rope on the border, over and over
Like a damn on the boundary, just out of sight
Over and over, just below the skyline
Over and over, just out of sight

Something broke, over and over
Something broke, over the way
Something dropped, over and over
Something dropped, just out of sight

Over and over, just below the skyline
Over and over, just out of sight
Over and under, under the sideline
Over and under, just out of sight

// It's A Boy //

Hook fear lashing
Spit-gas sinking
Tired reflections
In a broken eye

You're a strange one
Are there any more like you?
You're a rare one
I want one too

Head collections
Private view
Flood damaged
In a baby plague

Effete means funny dreams
Offence on refusal
Look out Dr. Up
It's a boy as usual

// Boiling Boy //

Gifts of the west winds
Dark and deep
In secret sunset
Places creep

Lock up your hats
Lock up your hats

Progress with a vision
To practice with at home
A schism with an ism
To practice with at home
A collision with decision
To practice with at home

He transferred his soul
To his imagination
His atoms were excited
And he glowed in the dark
The boiling boy
Was a picture of confusion
But he had the advantage
Of a cold start heart

// Finest Drops //

The island monkeys love the dark
No one is home, they're thin-skinned sharks
Hue exchanging gives sea-leg walks
No one is home, the chemicals talk

Load up the spoiled goods
Hook up the spoiled gods
Fill up the kindness cups
Drink up the finest drops

Feeding frenzy, sleepless attacks
No one is home, power attracts
Death on a raft, life in a whale
No one is home to finish the tale

Paint it red, light it in blue
No one is home over at the zoo
Lashing together, a timbre design
No one is home, no one is blind

The last boat launched, cling to the rail
No one is home, they're in full sail
Forging chains, caught on the tracks
No one is home and they're not coming back

The island monkeys love the dark
No one is home, they've gone for a walk
The island monkeys love the dark
No one is home, the chemicals talk

// Eardrum Buzz //

No switch in this dark, but you search anyway
This is the night, here in the day
One thing remains perfectly clear
It's the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

Now you live in the world of the wave
And you scratch your name on the walls of the cave
Instincts never leave you perfectly clear
There's always a buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

Marco Polo has lost his way
The Louisville Lip has nothing to say
One thing remains perfectly clear
The buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

Custard Jack has lost his Mac
Captain Flash won't give it back
It seemed to them both perfectly clear
The buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

Buffalo Bill, deprived of will
Chasing a hamburger down the hill
It seemed to him perfectly clear
The buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

Adolf turned out very nice
Hannibal is afraid of mice
One thing remains perfectly clear
It's the buzz buzz buzz in the drum of the ear

Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum
Zee zee zee, zum zum
Buzz buzz, buzz buzz in the eardrum

// German Shepherds //

I saw three dogs flying, there was a man on the end
Squaring a circle and studying its end
I saw a drunk old lady pissing in a bin
It was far too high, she couldn't stop

The man with the photograph failed to appear
In that kind of rain where an umbrella's no use
The bird lay bleeding, I couldn't break its neck
I get anonymous footbells from a pope I never met

Don't start me off
It's beginning, to, and back again
Don't start me off

Right now there's a man who could take advantage
I wouldn't like to spend an hour locked inside him
He always had an eye for it, we all threw a shoe
Nicely underlined, our table turned again

// Public Place //

In this public place
Pigeons move busily
Through the contents
Of a man's life
In this public place
His last mortal remains
Reflect a private lake
In this public place

Lies fly in formation
Candid fiction spreads its wings
It's deceptive at this angle
Does truth dance?
Does truth sing?

The private hedge pissers
In anxious alleys
The village boy-wide-men
With a game on their hands
Wait for the sign
That will take them to Heaven
Wait for the sign
Only they understand

In this public place
A carved tree
Burst through an atheist's heart
And broken promises
Drifted into the shape of footprints
In this public place
Lies fly in-formation
Candid fiction spreads its wings

// Illuminated //

Would he say, "yeah"?
Would he say, "no"?

What would he say?
What would he say?

Give them the chance
Give them the chance

What do you like?
What do you love?

Where did he go?
What did he do?
(What have you done?)

(Give them the chop?)

// The Offer //

I got to be for the offer of virtue
Once in and taken apart
This is the shape of interference
Please don't adjust your heart

Now touching the edges of something
Wanting to find truer response
Could I ever erase the influence?
Brushing in against what's (already) understood

Dredging shifting basing phrasing
Once in and taken to heart
I fought your red colour
I scratch your head again

Staring trying embracing gazing
I shot your silver dollar
Fill the space within your heart
You wear my golden collar

// In Vivo //

With colour in your life there's a reason to explode
To set the world on fire
To skid and leave the road
In a black and white life there's a column of smoke
You don't burst into flame, you stop
When you're broke

In vitrio in vivo
The revolution's begun
In vitrio in vivo

In a star-filled world the full moon crosses the sun
Four minutes up
Two million's gone
And bang: he invades
The son of a gun, the son
Of a gun

The chemical defeater saved the elephant's life
A wild type junk genie
With a car-bra heaven wide
And bang, he invades
The son of a gun, the son
Of a gun
