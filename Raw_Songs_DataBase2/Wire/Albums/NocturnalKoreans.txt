Album: NocturnalKoreans

// Nocturnal Koreans //

I dressed and I showered
Before I awoke
I was fit for one purpose
I was going for broke
I brushed out my trail
Concealed my advance
Changing wheels often
There'd be no second chance

Do you think you are able
Of finding your way?

Bipolar opps met
Under sodium lamps
Five miles out from
The runway ramp
Drug impaired drivers
Lost in the woods
Believe sea-burnt nurses
Never tasted so good!

Um-um-um-um-um-um
Um-um-um-um-um!

Nocturnal Koreans
Are walking the halls
They missed their connection
They're climbing the walls
Cracker barrel kids
And their cracker barrel folks
Beavis and Butthead...
Thro' their cracker barrel jokes!

Her-her-her-her-her-her
Her-her-her-her-her

// Internal Exile //

An idle glance absorbs the terror
The weight of proof brings little pleasure
The trick's the thing, a cereal measure
Mao sifts the shit from trash to treasure

Marching! Marching!
Primed and armed, a loose projectile
Forced into internal exile

In Apple light, the laptop lackeys
Software pedlars rake the readies
Backstab sermons sitting pretty
Bankrupt, cynics leave the city

Marching! Marching!
His cupboard bare; his vision hardwired
Roving tamer; empty larder

Hearts of gold; no pot to piss in
Join the queue of future has-beens
A worker's thirst to be at leisure
Dissatisfied without measure

// Dead Weight //

Every risk you take could end in a thousand tears
Even triumphs turn to pain as they disappear
Strategies are all fine and good if they play out well
But you might be better off with a wishing well

Buried in a distant forest
Chapters lost and then retrieved
All the unheard answers fly
Glide like butterflies

Simple acts of faith can become a strategy
Elegance of considered thought leading to synergy
Create new pathways between the hemispheres of the brain
An unlikely path that might just keep you sane

// Forward Position //

Shake me if there's any movement
Warn me if you hear a sound
Coded, flickered, triggered
Signals buried underground

From my ruin, long forgotten
Dreams of hope arise in smoke
I am black box, I remember
Every promise that you broke

Knowing there's no point in running
At daybreak, we'll soon be found
Wake me when you see them coming
Hear their steel keels run aground

From my ruin, long forgotten
Dreams of hope arise in smoke
I am black box, I remember
Every promise that you broke

The canyon floor provides protection
The star-filled sky is dark remote
Satellite and drone detection
Seize the time and catch your throat

Buildings opened to the sky glow
Timbers tumble through the floor
Chopper downwash; overhead noose
Jet buzz lasso, stay indoors

// Numbered //

Believing in something
Believing in nothing
Reliving each moment
Or forgetting everything in time

Our days may be numbered
Our nights remain slumbered
Our meter is measured
Or regretting everything in time

You think I'm a dreamer
I've never really been there
A presence conjured from thin air
You think I'm a number
Still willing to rhumba
To lay it bare as if I care

Some people have questions
Some people have answers
Some people have nothing
They're holding everything in time

The spell may be broken
The demons have woken
The days are still pressing
And regressing everything in time

You think I'm a dreamer
I've never really been there
A presence conjured from thin air
You think I'm a number
Still willing to rumba
To lay it bare as if I care

// Still //

Not with standing
Still alone
Inside outside
Above and beyond

Play box foot fall
Light fails
Art crossed
Between

Sun fun under
Everything
Over round on
Twist up

Empty looks
Indians
Too few
Too men
Cooks

// Pilgrim Trade //

Our African sisters have a spiritual plan
They follow the teachings of a triangular man
The AD to BC, the black and white gang
Amazed by cheap lasers, they're getting a tan

Magnetic steps funnel a babel of tongues
Sucking cash out of pockets, air out of lungs
The hordes that are eating a path through her doors
Record digital memories of her ceilings and floors

Harvesting pilgrims is an eternal trade
Sins are forgiven, indulgences gained
Confessions are heard; contrition is made
Entry to heaven will not be delayed

// Fishes Bones //

The back door
The back door
The back door's open
Are you needing a boost?
Inside is where my chickens roost
Just because you haven't got a TV in there
Are you needing a boost?
Just because you haven't got a TV in there
A person must be who they am
Doing the very best they can
How you get here
How did you get here?
I've often wondered
How will you get there?
I haven't a clue
What's the plan?
How will you get there?
How do you plan?
No!

I've often wondered what the fuck was going on in there
I'm counting fishes
Am making the dishes
I will... make all your wishes come true
Come true
Come true
They'll come true
I sent a message to your mobile home
I'm counting rings in a fish's bones
I'm counting rings/bones

Bones/rings
Bones/rings
Fishes!
Bones/rings
Bones/rings
Fishes! Rings!
Bones/rings
Fishes! Rings!

Rings and rings and rings and rings and rings...
