// Blogging //

Three king researchers, use Google star maps
Bethlehem manger, a high-rated app
Book rooms at the inn, flags first born male traps
Amazon wish-list, delivery elapse

Blogging like Jesus, tweet like a Pope
Site traffic heavy, I'm YouTubing hope

Shepherds are wanted, to mesmerise sheep
Taste-makers prosper, profits are reaped
Market moves fast in, a blink of an eye
The needle is broken, the camel has died

Blogging like Jesus, tweet like a Pope
Site traffic heavy, I'm YouTubing hope

Voting by proxy, buying online
Selling on eBay, all that is mine
BlackBerry hedge fund, new Apple's divine
Dream time destruction, outback becomes mine

Blogging like Jesus, tweet like a Pope
Site traffic heavy, I'm YouTubing hope
Blogging like Jesus, tweet like a Pope
Site traffic heavy, I'm YouTubing hope

Hope!
Hope!
Hope!
I'm YouTubing hope

// Shifting //

I didn't see it coming
I was taken by surprise
There was something in the air
But I failed to read the signs

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies

Didn't see the bigger picture
Failed to read between the lines
Your agenda, you had hidden
In my blue and cloudless sky

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies

I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
And you knew it was over
I could see it in your eyes
I gave you one more chance
I gave you one more chance
A shifting of position
An omission, telling lies

// Burning Bridges //

The sun was going down
Shadows lengthened on the ground
Snow fell silently and deep
Blanketing the empty streets
In a fragile way, couldn't face another day
In need of love and care, broken, under repair

I'm the quicksands of despair
In the desert of unfair
You found me drowning there
Caught my glance of do not care
You took me to your bed, laid your hands upon my head
Said, "Sleep now have no fear, you are safe for I am here"

We'd talked the night away, into another day
In the morning, you were gone, now every moment seems too long
My thoughts went round and round, impossible to sleep
I started burning bridges, when I gave up counting sheep

An asbestos chimney, can shorten your life

// In Manchester //

One of the men that spawned fibre optic prawns
Barely concealed a grand canyonic yawn
Passed a Nationalist getting buried in Manchester
In Manchester

Tricolour flying, the sun shining, large crowd around
A freshly dug grave, priest arm blesses, the flag is waving
Stern Indian serves original flavourings, in Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah huh

I don't yet know how my story will end
Dead or in prison or completely around the bend
A strong punch was essential, dust heads exploded

In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah huh
...

// High //

High on snowploughs
Escape brief loveless
Our maple leaf
Ancestral shame

The where and when to, you aspire
A Wren born guide, to London's spires

Denounce the church
Of herding cats
Build pyramids
Of acrobats

The who and what to, you desire
An arsonistic, love of fire

The how and if
For budding liars
The Trappist guide
To happy hours

// Sleep-Walking //

We're at a tipping point
The arguments may lead
To less cohesion
A mere collection of parts

Sleepwalking to separation
Who'd give the perpetrators
A second chance
If reason could prevail

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal

Whose rights to shout the loudest?
Should bully tactics triumph
When no one cares
And all stand idly by

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal

// Joust & Jostle //

The joust and jostle
Cooking, rolling
Bingo bombing
Off the wall plane
The reason that you're late
I don't speak to them
Winding up they, smell defeat
Crumble dice games
To the [?]
Ice climb dancing
Dancing shoes on
Whistle for love song
Game is on the move
In a place in which
We belong

The Flying Dutchman
Touches land, he
[?]
Tends the land
The lunar land
But the [?]
Touches gently
It's that moment
Safe from hazard [?]
Make her stronger
Way that type is
I'm in love with you
Cross our hearts and
Hope to die
The love we're hoping
Start to fly

// Swallow //

The windy city swallows corn
Volcanic princess brings a storm
Count me out, I love the spring
Curdled creams another thing
Heaven's open, there's no space
For a future Afghan ace
Testosterone plus, and gym built strong
The meat is off, gravity blonde

A heavy elder mans the door
Working girls, man, man the floor
They scope the room, enhance the groove
Teaching aliens shamanic moves
It's in your face that dumb arse smile
Not worth a piss, ain't got no style
The white kids are a crying shame
They've got it all but parked their brains

// Split Your Ends //

Under the hammer
A celebration of childhood
An impeding stammer
Words alone matter
When visual sense fails
Estimates broken

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

Tiny terror
Orange fly weight
Box above don't hit below
Speeding through the ever
Changing seasons
Come, and people go

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

A trawler captain
Scoops the loot
As prices shoot
Purple panther
Pulls the shades
And draws my fire

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Ends

// Octopus //

She opens her mouth and seems to swallow us all
She shakes off taboos and unwanted organisms
There's a man outside who says he's come to read, the ether
Picking up bonus points when it's time for dinner

There's always someone who thinks they've got a plan
Someone with a whip in hand, who thinks they are a man
A rescue package that will barely save the day
Even when implemented with no further delay
Delay

Predictive octopods, enchanting and seductive
Even the most mundane thoughts seem quite sensuous
This installation seem to bathe us all in sound
Picking up clues from penitential saviours

There's always someone who thinks they've got a plan
Someone with a whip in hand, who thinks they are a man
A rescue package that will barely save the day
Even when implemented with no further delay
Delay

There's always someone who thinks they've got a plan
Someone with a whip in hand, who thinks they are a man
A rescue package that will barely save the day
Even when implemented with no further delay
Delay

// Harpooned //

Day delayed messages, arrive and repeat, ah, ah
Ernest T. died, so we'll now never meet
I set fire to the kitchen, the damage was bad, ah, sad
I sat down by the fountain, went quietly mad

I'm worried, I'm worried, there's cause for concern
I lit the touch paper and it started to burn
I'm worried, I'm worried there's cause for concern
Ignited and cornered, there's nowhere to turn

Better 'fess up, you're right off the scale, ah, but
Lately the second, swallowed a whale
Reality bends, and the hospital curves, ah, ah
Was it the weather, which got into your nerves?

I'm worried, I'm worried, I'm frightened as hell
I heard voices echo way down in my shell
I'm worried, I'm worried, I'm frightened as hell
Walls closing in, I'm feeling unwell

Oh, was it the weather, which got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
