// One Of Us //

Can I make it plainer?
I misjudged your intentions
Misread behaviour
That beggars many questions
What happened to our plan
The one that we began?
Are you an also-ran?
Finished? Inconsequential?

Declining, and divining
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
Breaching, over-reaching
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other

It's a no-brainer
It's time to test the mettle
Reasoned? Insaner?
Infected scores to settle
No safety-netted plan
We're here, we will, we can
Finish what we began
Never, ever damned for trying...

// Circumspect //

Can you tell me what you saw?
Can you tell me what you thought you heard?
Or were you just oblivious?
No recall to re-assess

Was it true or simply words?
Was my answer fully understood?
Or were you just oblivious?
No will left to re-address

Did you believe a thing I said?
To put it yet another way
Was it just too obvious?
Lost between the two of us?

Had you faith in what you tried to do?
Or simply had to have another view
You were being devious
Always dark and circumspect

// Mekon Headman //

Mekon Headman
Combed Camp Delta
Down the path
Of no return
Refused demands to
Pay at gunpoint
A loco trio's
Doorstep plan

Please let me
Help you remember
Your memory's shot
You've lost the plot
Please reveal
Your whole agenda
Your time is up
(You fuckin' crumb)

The windshield holds up
On my auto
After a freeway
Bridge attack
Surgeon General's
Package warning
If you persist
Your time is up

// Perspex Icon //

Is it Art or Artifice?
Can you save your prejudice?
Would you call it low or high?
Can you declare your interest?

An icon in perspex
Sustained exposure, increased risk
Perspective lost and concept shattered
Maintain your prerogative
Self-promotion, motor spinning
Palms are greased and egos flattered

Create the market
Can you find out where to park it?
Will you play your favourites?
The way to lighten your pocket

An icon in perspex
Sustained exposure, increased risk
Perspective lost and concept shattered
Maintain your prerogative
Self-promotion, motor spinning
Palms are greased and egos flattered

// Four Long Years //

A collapse of concentration
A futility of words
A loss of all sensation
An arbitrary world

Too fast, too slow
The operator does not know
Can't sleep, can't weep
For years and years, not much to show
With luck, with charm
The operator may succeed
Impact, in fact
Today's inspection may proceed

Finese, deceive and flatter
The chemically mis-matched
The sound of missing matter
Advances sealed and snatched

// Hard Currency //

Exotic syntax strange
Is it an increase in pressure?
Everyone looks insane
It came with the change in weather

Hard currency exchange
No credit cash in pocket
Everyone's made the same
Erotic body socket

I've taken an early train
So we can be together
Arrival's re-arranged
It's strictly for your pleasure

// Patient Flees //

Heartaches are anodised, mid-sentence accusations
Turncoats and cutting throats, agreed at the inception
The never, ever poison, starts with cash injection
Improvise a compromise, cruel credit-card rejections

Premonition, humiliation, inspiration, intoxication
Provocation, subjugation, discrimination, motivation

Every joke an alibi, a wretched truth extension
Each word a sugared lie, a sweet-coated deception
Pull out the poisoned darts of paranoid perception
Witness the fitness of impatient interventions

Resurrection, insurrection, defection, disaffection
Infection, imperfection, disinfection, rejection

Facts have been analysed, conditions now are stable
Operations paralyzed, instructions on the label
Cut out the poisoned parts; leaving something able
Salvaged the savage, the patient flees the table

Demolition, substitution, resolution, evolution
Devaluation, inspection, abjection, deselection
Resurrection, insurrection, defection, disaffection
Premonition, motivation, inspiration, intoxication

// Are You Ready? //

Are you part of the future
Part of the plan?
Are you willing and able
To do what you can?
Are you part of the problem
Or part of the band?
Are you willing to draw
A line in the sand?
Are you true to your friends
Loyal to your brand?
Are you smoking for China
Iraq or Japan?
Are you searching for something
You don't understand?
Do you still hold ambitions
Of being a man?

Are you ready to live?
Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to live?
Are you ready to die?

Are you sickening for something?
Feeling unwell?
Are you drawn to corruption
In love with its smell?
Are you keeping a secret
Got something to tell?
Are you fighting for reason
Under its spell?
Are you dreaming of Heaven
Living in Hell?
Are you preaching for Jesus
For Apple or Dell?
Are you doomed to succeed
Are you happy to fail?
Are you facing extinction
The end of the trail?

// All Fours //

Sensitivity levels, confusion limits
The density of unresolved ideas
In the field of view, energy emits
A fluxus level ride of evolution

Rethinking strategies
Terror forms in liquid slums
Dictators' ships supplied at all costs
Sulphur spots and rising tides
Fetid chancellors of taste
Lowest counts since moonman walked on all fours

Understanding formation and evolution
Starburst galaxies and population
Energy budgets of luminosity
Occurring daily to gauge determination
