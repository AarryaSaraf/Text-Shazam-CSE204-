I look at my telephone book 
I can't stand the way it look 
I hate to think the way you took 
me down into a burnin' rage 
I wrote your name on every page 
but you don't return my calls 
you don't return my calls 
you don't return my calls 
I'm ready to bust down the walls 
I'm going down Niagara Falls 
in a barrel of fun 
hey ain't I a lucky one 
you don't return my calls 
my telephone book is the color red 
my telephone book is the color red 
the red is all in my head 
some things are left better unsaid 
is that why you don't try 
to acknowledge or reply 
you don't return my calls 
why did you hear from an old friend 
I knew once way back when 
I did some bad things to myself and my health 
or did you happen to hear an old song I once sang 
did it make your sweet sweet blood run cold in your veins 
and will you never think of me the same
