In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
Kind and kindly 
Soft and silly 
Wile and willy-ling-ly-lessness
Much less much less 
What's best what's best 
Lifelessness 
My doll is dead 
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along

In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
Kind and kindly 
Soft and silly 
Wile and willy-ling-ly-lessness

Lifelessness 
My doll is dead 

Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along
Listen to the song sing along

In the mourning
Of the morning 
I hear mourning 
Of the deepest kind 
...
