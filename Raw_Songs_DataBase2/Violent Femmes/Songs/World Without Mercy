When your words have no meaning
and you're known as no one,
am I someone to you,
someone to turn to,
even when others turn away?
Even though others turn away?

When history blurs,
and every man, women, and child,
are left outside with no phones to be dialed,
you can't call me, I can't you.
You can't call me, I can't you.

In a world without mercy,
people dine outside your door.
In a world without mercy,
you don't have to lie anymore.
You don't have to cry anymore.

When laughter loses all its humor
and the joke is on you,
don't take it so personal,
all this world reversal.
The things they said don't matter anyway.
The things they said don't matter anyway.

In a world without mercy,
people dine outside your door.
In a world without mercy,
you don't have to lie anymore.
You don't have to cry anymore.

Oh, can it be so painful?
Can it be so blind?
Love is vicious angel,
fluttering wings, trapped inside your mind.

When your words have no meaning
and you're known as no one,
am I someone to you,
someone to turn to,
even when others turn away?
