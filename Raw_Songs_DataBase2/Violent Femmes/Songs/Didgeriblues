Once I knew a dude who blew the didgeridoo.
He knew a girl who he decided to woo to
under her balcony with a didgeridoo
and did she know you would do the digeridoo too,
if you knew she'd do, do the didgeridoo.
Then a baby came one day
and daddy would stay by the cradle to lay.
Cooche, cooche, coo.
Cooche, cooche, coo.
on his trusty didgeridoo.
and did she know you who do the digeridoo too,
if you knew she'd do, do the didgeridoo.
When A and R man heard that rumble,
he signed him up man, quiet little bundle.
Made a record in L. A.
where I here the people still will say,
damn, that cat, he really moved.
He knew what to do on the didgeridoo.
Now all over the world this song debuts,
its hitting the charts,
all number ones and number two's.
This song has swept the nations.
The didgeridooblues.
If that you would love it too,
if you could do the didgeridoo.
Now, if that she would love you too,
if she knew you could do the didgeridoo.
if she knew you could do the didgeridoo.
if she knew you who blew the didgeridoo.
