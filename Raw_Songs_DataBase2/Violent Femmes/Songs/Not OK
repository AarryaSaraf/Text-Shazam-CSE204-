I could write something better in my sleep
I could sing so pretty it'd make your heart weep
I could steal a kiss but it could not keep out love

I could read something better in a book
I could break your heart with just one look
You could tear me apart and that's what you mistook for love

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And it is not okay

I can hear so much better than you can speak
I can see right through you with just one peek
So why'd you go and try to seek more love?

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And it is not okay

You can sing so much better in the shower
You can count up the minutes that make up an hour
That's all it did take to crush and break our love

But I could write something better in my sleep
I could sing so pretty it'd make your heart weep
You can steal a kiss but it will not keep my love

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And I am not okay
