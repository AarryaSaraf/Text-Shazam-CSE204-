The prophet is a fool
the spiritual man is mad
For the multitude of thy iniquity
And the great hatred...

Everyone's tryin
to decide
where to go
when theres no place to hide
I follow the bombs as theyre coming down
This must have been
Hallowed Ground

Ooooooo ooo ooo ooooo ooo oo o o

No matter what
they decide to have done
burn up the clouds
Block out the sun

My hope is in 
one they cant bring down
My soul is in
Hallowed Ground

Oo ooo oooo oo

I see the fear
Its on the rise
Lets catch the enemy
By surprise

Bury your treasure
Where it cant be found
Bury it deep
In Hallowed Ground

Ooo ooo ooo oooo oo ooo oo o
Ooo ooo ooo oooo oo ooo oo oooooooo
