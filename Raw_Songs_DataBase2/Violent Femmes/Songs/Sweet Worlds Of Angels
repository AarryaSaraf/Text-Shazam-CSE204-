I think that I would like to
stroll down a street or two.
Stop by some places that I know
and see whats become of me.
Stay close and comfort.
The winds that tear em up.
Now, they're breezing out to pasture
and I'm breezing in and out.
Flow, let it flow.
It's just so mellow under my pillow.
It's just so mellow I'm surrounded by pillows.
Don't feel afraid.
I'm a little out of sleep.
Just me come to call
With my frozen teeth and melted lips.
I will come and run to meet the sun
when my songs for the morning
and then I will smile upon you
with my peace and my yearning.
Flow, let if flow.
It,s just so mellow under my pillow.
It,s just so mellow I'm surrounded by pillows.
The sun was yellow.
Beneath the streaming through the trees. 
Clouds are great pillows
Floating so grandly above the trees
Why is everybody so hollow
So I kill everything.
Sweet worlds of angels. 
Sweet worlds of angels.
Sweet worlds of angels
Some never never never die die.
Sweet worlds of angels.
Some never never never die die.
Sweet worlds of angels.
Some never never never die die.
Beautiful angels.
Don't ever leave me behind.
Your all too perfuming of my life.
I think that I would like to
stroll down a street or two.
Stop by some places that I know
and see whats become of me.
