Don't remember anything you said
I don't remember any books that you have ever read
I don't remember the sound of your voice
I don't remember but it's not by choice

So I wish I could remember something you said
I wish that I could read every book that you ever have read
I wish I could hear the sound of your voice
I don't remember but it's now your choice

To come back from that well of a void
Come back so that I could tell you how I'm annoyed

By the fact that I can't remember your smile or your frown
I can't remember the name of your hometown
I don't remember the color of your eyes
I don't remember so hey, I guess it's a little surprise

That I want to will you wonder would you wander back from where you are
You see I see I can not see but I come so far with a little guitar
That I play in bars and I'm lost in stars

Memory

Oh, come back from that well of a void
Come back so that I could tell you how I'm annoyed
Because come so far with a little guitar
That I play in bars and I'm lost in stars

Memory
Memory
Memory
