I don't wanna see my brother die 
We don't want no killing Lord 
I don't wanna to see my sister cry 
I don't wanna see 
I don't wanna see I I I I I 
I know that bad things are going down 
I, I know that loneliness is all around 
I know that the world is starved for love 
Love 
Y'know that there's good 
And there's evil 
And there's evil 
Disguised as good 
They're knocking at my door 
They're knocking at my door 
Don't let them in 
Don't let them in 
I think it's the Milwaukee Police 
I think it's the police 
I think it's the polizei 
I think it's the polizei I I I 
Everyday everyday everyday everyday 
I need your love love 
And it's a bad bad score 
And I need you all the more 
I need your love 
Love
