I see no way out.
I feel a closing in.
Living this way, I won't live this way.
Its no way to live.
I am not grateful.
I am hateful.
I see stupid things,
So I say stupid things.
One thing I know I want to go
Where my heart can't hurt no more.
I am not grateful.
I am hateful.

I am not grateful.
I am painful.
