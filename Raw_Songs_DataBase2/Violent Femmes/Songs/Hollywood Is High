Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high

Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
All the wood is dry
No place to go
Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
Cars all pass by
With no place to go

And I don't wanna have fun
Fun always lets me down
And I don't wanna stay young
And always be just hangin' round

Sir where do they sell this magazine?
Calculation to excite
And sir you can tell it's not obscene
Penetration in black and white

And I don't wanna look
Lookin' always let me down
And all the paths he forsook
Only left him hangin' round

L.A.
From the valley to the shore
It's OK
But I don't want nothing from you anymore

Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
Do not ask why
Thomas Guide says so

And I don't wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna have fun
Fun it always lets me down
And I don't wanna stay young
You know I'd be just be hangin' 'round

Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
