We got the mother and her kids
We got the guy and his date
We all get mad
We all get late
Looks like somebody forgot about us
Standing on the corner, waiting for the bus

Say hey mr. driver man, don't be slow
Cause i got somewhere i gotta go
Say hey mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past

Let's call the mayor, let's complain
Looks like the city's done it to us again
Tied up in traffic, what do you know
The damn city bus, it moves so slow

Say hey mr. driver man, don't be slow
Cause i got somewhere i gotta go
Say hey mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past

[*talking, instrumental*]
