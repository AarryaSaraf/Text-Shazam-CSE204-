Every time you start to whine
You could stop on a dime
You could change your mind
Have you done your best
Can you pass that test
That's a hundred percent
It's just like payin' the rent

'Cause its all or nothing
Yes its all, all or nothing
And when you fall, it's really something
But you give your all
Or you give nothing

If you like me like I like you
Let's take it slow
That'll make it grow
I can't tell you what you should do
But I thought you should know
I'm only good to go

If it's all or nothing
With me it's all or nothing
And if I fall, that will be something
But I give my all
Or I give nothing

Oh it's all or nothing
Life is all, all or nothing
And when you fall
It's really something
But you give your all
Or you get nothing, nothing

You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing
