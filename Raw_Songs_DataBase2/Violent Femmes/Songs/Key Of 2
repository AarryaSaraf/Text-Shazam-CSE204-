Well I was sentenced to prison
To do about one year
They said it isn't so bad 
We got a good band here
We play every Wednesday night
Sometimes Tuesday too
It's the music of the future and it will get to you
When I heard the band for the first time
They has no (rhythm). They had no (rhyme)
Well it almost like a dream
I never wanted to have
It drove me (crazy). It drove me (mad)
The man said: "C'mon and play
And here's an instrument for you
It's an ancient flute

It's in the key of 2. Blow..."
I gotta get more time. I gotta stay in here
I used to be foggy
But the music made me clear
Now the jail in rockin' like Elvis never knew
I'm on the inside now. I'm in the key of 2
Now we all are lifers and I'm in the band too
We play my favorite song. It's in the key of 2
And it will get to you
It's the music of the future and it will get to you
And it will get to you
It's the music of the future. It's in the key of 2
