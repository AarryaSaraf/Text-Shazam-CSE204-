I'm free and I'm happy 
I am free from your hatred 
I've parted from the part 
that I participated in 
so I'm free it was easy 
I know nothing of your hatred 
I've known and shone the light 
and the darkness abated 
so I'm free 
run skip jump play 
my little boy is happy 
look he's smiling because 
he knows no fear... hear... 
my mommy's calling me 
and I'm running thru the fields 
because I'm free... 
every day in every way 
I'm getting better and better and better 
and better and better and better, etc 
because there's no fear... here why 
I can't tell you now cause 
I'm runnin through the woods 
and I just jumped a little bit higher... 
cause I'm free 
and that's the way he created me to be 
I have turned from your hatred 
I turned on the light 
and there was nothing there that waited to get me 
this ain't a song about that this is a song about this
