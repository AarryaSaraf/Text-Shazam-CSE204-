he's in the dark
night is his friend
he's on a mission that can never end
he has a hart that was broke long ago
he has more women than you'll ever know

hi daddy hi daddy hi daddy ho
hey daddy hi daddy no one will know
no one will know

he has a laughter and he has the fame
gets what he's after and wins the last game
knows how to kiss and he knows how to fly
his life at risk but he never will die,

hey daddy ho daddy hey daddy hi
hey daddy ho daddy never will die
never will die

what does he get out of playing his game
life of regret and a mother's shame
when he is done and his task it is through
his race is won and is completed too
then to unwind with a close friend or two
ask not for me but he'll give it to you

hey daddy ho daddy hi daddy who
hey daddy ho he will give it to you,
give it to you

he's in the dark and the night is his friend
he's on a mission that can never end
