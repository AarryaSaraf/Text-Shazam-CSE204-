I needed time to realize my crime
It was let me love and steal 
I did dances inside my mind 
Now how can I be real 

Do you really want to hurt me? 
Do you really want to make me cry? 
No I don t really want to hurt you 

Then lovers always asked me: 
Why why why why in my mind my memory's burning 
What's your favorite color of your favorite car? 
I took a step 
The step was learning that that's a step beyond a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me? 
Do you really want to make me cry?
No I don't really want to hurt you 

I told the truth but it was still a lie 
The words are few 
Some are unspoken 
I could sleep four thousand years 
Man of sorrows word unbroken 
His sweat like blood came down like tears 
I've been talking 
But believe me 
I know that it's true now that there's no more 
I don't know 
I'm in love and love's the reason I'm not prepared to let you let me go 
So if it's love you want 
Then take all of me 
It's this love I want 
I can finally see 

Do I really want to hurt you? 
Do I really want to make you cry? 
Yes I suppose I want to hurt you 
You told the truth but it was still a lie
