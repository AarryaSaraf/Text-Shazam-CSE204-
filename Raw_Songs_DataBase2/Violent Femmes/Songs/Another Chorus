This place is alright and the band is okay
Took a bit to get here so we might as well stay
But what's the singer saying, it's hard to really know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that starts to bore us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing

A verse is like a chorus if you sing it more than once
This feels like it's been going on for days and weeks and months
What's the singer saying, i'd give it up to know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing

Some things go on forever
Seemingly and endlessly
Like this band's best endeavor
To sing a chorus unceasingly

Oh this place is alright and the band is okay
Took a bit to get in so we might as well stay
But what's the singer saying, I don't even wanna know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no
Here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing (please don't sing)

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing (please don't sing)

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing
