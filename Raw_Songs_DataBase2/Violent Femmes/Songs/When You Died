I quit thinking about killing myself
when you died
just for a day or two
i must have wanted to
just for a day or two
I must have wanted to live

I quit believing these lies I tell myself
when you died
just for a day or two
I must have wanted to
just for a day or two
I must have wanted the truth

I will always love you my friend
now that you died
but just for a day or two
I'd like to be with you
just for a day or two
I'd like to have you alive
