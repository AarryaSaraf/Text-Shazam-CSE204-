I can't go out no more
I just better stay at home
I can't go out no more
I just better stay all alone

'Cause what am I gonna do
If I see someone I'd like to do something to
What am I gonna say
If I see someone I'd like to say something to
If I see someone who'd like to do something too

I can't help being careful
Did you notice the world
That we're living in
Did you notice, did you see
Something might happen to me
Ddid you notice a chill in the wind 
People are dying
Just because they had a little
Girlfriend is not my girlfriend
Ny neighbor is not my lover
Boyfriend is not my boyfriend
My brother is not my lover
Behavior is not my behavior
My neighbor is not my savior
Didn't you notice the world
That we're living in
