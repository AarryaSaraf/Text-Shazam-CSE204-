// American Music //

Can I, can I put in something like... "This is "American Music"... take one." 1-2-3-4!
Do you like American music? I like American music.
Don't you like American music, baby?

I want you to hold me, I want your arms around me.
I want you to hold me, baby...
Did you do too many drugs? I did too many drugs.
Did you do too many drugs, too, baby?

You were born too late, I was born too soon,
But every time I look at that ugly moon, it reminds me of you.
It reminds me of you... ooh-ooh-ooh.

I need a date to the prom, would you like to come along?
But nobody would go to the prom with me, baby...
They didn't like American music, they never heard American music.
They didn't know the music was in my soul, baby...

You were born too soon, I was born too late,
But every time I look at that ugly lake, it reminds me of me.
It reminds me of me...

Do you like American music? We like American music.
I like American music... Baby.
Do you like American music? We like all kinds of music.
But I like American music best... baby.

You were born too late, and I was born too late,
But every time I look at that ugly lake, it reminds me of me...

// Out The Window //

Life was fun
life was great
til I made my big mistake
oh no it'll never happen to me
life was short
and life was sweet
I was thinking as I hit the street
I could hardly beleve
I could scarcely conceive
but I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
I had gone out the window
she was fine
she looked great
and so we made our big mistake
I swear I swear I swear
it'd never happen to her
but the pavement knocked her head around
when she hit the solid concrete ground
from 30 flights above
and she was thirty something loving nothing
gone out the window
she had gone out the window
she had gone out the window
catch me if I'm falling,
catch me if I'm calling
he was smart he was wise
he'd profoundly philosophize
empathy for all humanity
'til one day by an open window
there's a note that read
I've gone out the window - I'm dead
he said yes to life for all of his life
but then one day he said no
I gotta go out the window
we all go out the window
catch me I am falling
catch me I am calling
catch me we are falling
catch me we are calling

// Look Like That //

I like his shoes I like his hat
I'd like me better if I looked like that 
uh -huh uh-huh 
I like her shoes I like her hat 
I'd like you better if you looked like that 
uh-huh uh-huh 
but then my love starts burning 
for what we are yearning to ignore 
I like her clothes I love her dress 
I'd like her better if she loved me best 
I like his shoes I love his pants 
I'd want him better if he wanted to dance 
uh-huh uh-huh 
but then our love starts turning 
for what we are learning to adore 
I'm meeting people nice people too 
I'm meeting people nice people like you 
we're meeting people nice people too 
we're meeting people nice people like you

// Do You Really Want To Hurt Me? //

I needed time to realize my crime
It was let me love and steal 
I did dances inside my mind 
Now how can I be real 

Do you really want to hurt me? 
Do you really want to make me cry? 
No I don t really want to hurt you 

Then lovers always asked me: 
Why why why why in my mind my memory's burning 
What's your favorite color of your favorite car? 
I took a step 
The step was learning that that's a step beyond a step too far

Do you really want to hurt me? 
Do you really want to make me cry?
No I don't really want to hurt you 

I told the truth but it was still a lie 
The words are few 
Some are unspoken 
I could sleep four thousand years 
Man of sorrows word unbroken 
His sweat like blood came down like tears 
I've been talking 
But believe me 
I know that it's true now that there's no more 
I don't know 
I'm in love and love's the reason I'm not prepared to let you let me go 
So if it's love you want 
Then take all of me 
It's this love I want 
I can finally see 

Do I really want to hurt you? 
Do I really want to make you cry? 
Yes I suppose I want to hurt you 
You told the truth but it was still a lie

// Hey Nonny, Nonny //

Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her...
The winds blew calm, the birds did sing, the cool streams ran beside her.
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden,
But better memory said "fie" so vain desire was chidden.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

Into a slumber then I fell when fond imagination,
Seemed to see but could not tell her feature or her fashion.
But e'vn as babes in dreams do smile and sometimes fall a-weeping,
So I awaked as wise this while as when I fell a-sleeping.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

Say, man, are you down for doing something positive in the community?
No, I don't think I'll ever do that again.
Well, ain't you worried about doing the right thing?
Well, I don't care if I hey-nonny-nonny-nonny-ho-nonny-nonny-nonny...

Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her...
The winds blew calm, the birds did sing, the cool streams ran beside her.
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden,
But better memory said "fie" so vain desire was chidden.

Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.
Hey, nonny nonny, oh, hey nonny nonny.

// Used To Be //

I used to be happy
I used to be
Such a loving man
I used to be
That was before
The end of my world
That was before
The end of my world
She used to be happy
She used to be
Such a loving woman
She used to be
That was before
The end of her world
That was before
The end of her world
We used to be happy
We used to be

Such a loving people
We used to be
That was before
The end of our world
That was before
The end of our world

// Girl Trouble //

Have mercy on me 
I got girl trouble up the ass

I need the cure

I need the cure

hey james brown 
I need a woman or a girl

and don't tell me no joke 
cause I'm not gonna laugh

// He Likes Me //

He likes me

ooh... isn't that nice 
that your brand new friend 
he likes your old true friend 
and isn't that the way 
that it ought to be 
that your brand new friend 
he has good will to send 
and you're so free 
you're so free

and I am history

he says that he loves you 
ooh that's good to know 
you like him 
I hope you don't love him 
and ooh you should know 
that your old true friend 
he doesn't like your brand new friend 
person to person it's not on purpose 
but I take it personally 
and soon your brand new friend 
I hope I'll have a bon voyage to send 
and you're so free

that I should love my enemy 
darling my heart's in pain 
that's why my song's insane 
and you're so free 
and I am history 
he likes me 
but I don't like him

// Life Is A Scream //

She said to me oh I don't know what you mean
All I'm trying to do is
Trying to make your scene
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem
Well don't you know baby that life is a scream - aagh
She came up to me in her high fashion and sheen
Well don't you know that she was trying to come clean
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem
Well don't you know baby that life's a scream - aagh
She said to me oh I love it when you're mean
Don't you know it's boring when it's quiet and serene
I said to her no way baby life ain't what it seem

Got to get it through your head that life is a scream - aaheeii!

// Flamingo Baby //

You're a flamingo 
you stand on one leg 
you're a flamingo baby 
you hatched from an egg 
well you hold your foot up 
so delicately over the sea 
and when it comes down 
it comes down on me 
well it used to want to hump you 
I used to want to rock and roll 
I was attracted to your gracefulness 
but your surprise sure took its toll 
now I guess I'd better go out now 
gonna try to find something new 
and all I'm left with is this craving 
for some flamingo stew 
now the beauty's in the gutter 
the loveliness is off her throne 
in the eyes of the beholder it's gone 
and now he feels kind of alone 
but this feeling it's the kind that will shortly pass 
I'm gonna find myself another bird 
and roll on down the grass

// Lack Of Knowledge //

I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do 
I'm doing something I'm not supposed to 
I don't know about that 
I don't know about that 
I don't know nothing bout nothing like that 
destroyed my people are 
destroyed my people are 
destroyed for lack of knowledge 
I wonder if I'm happy 
wonder if I'm mad 
I wonder why the whole wide world is so wonderfully sad 
I don't know bout that but I can tell you this 
that when I drink a lot of beer y'know I gotta piss... off 
people should be pissed off 
people should be pissed off 
for lack of knowledge 
read read read read read read read everything you can read and 
learn learn learn learn learn learn learn everything you can learn 
cause there is no tomorrow like today 
and there is no today like tomorrow 
and they will stick you and they will stick you in the end

// More Money Tonight //

I always felt that I was different 
I always thought that that was good 
I always thought that I was different 
I always felt that that was good 
sometimes in school people pick on me 
in the gym locker room or in the hallway 
cruel things people do and say 
wait a minute wait a minute 
I'll make more money tonight than you ever dreamed of 
you thought I was strange well just look at me now 
if you are lucky I'll play in your city 
and you can come see me if you got the... 
somebody stole all my clothes that I like to wear 
but I'm so rich and famous baby what do I care 
wait a minute wait a minute 
if you got the money

// I'm Free //

I'm free and I'm happy 
I am free from your hatred 
I've parted from the part 
that I participated in 
so I'm free it was easy 
I know nothing of your hatred 
I've known and shone the light 
and the darkness abated 
so I'm free 
run skip jump play 
my little boy is happy 
look he's smiling because 
he knows no fear... hear... 
my mommy's calling me 
and I'm running thru the fields 
because I'm free... 
every day in every way 
I'm getting better and better and better 
and better and better and better, etc 
because there's no fear... here why 
I can't tell you now cause 
I'm runnin through the woods 
and I just jumped a little bit higher... 
cause I'm free 
and that's the way he created me to be 
I have turned from your hatred 
I turned on the light 
and there was nothing there that waited to get me 
this ain't a song about that this is a song about this
