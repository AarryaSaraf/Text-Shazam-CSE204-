Hello

Where are you

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

So now you keep your distance
Double on the nuisance
Avoid the situation
Avoid your occupation
Hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

You're never here when you're needed
Nothing ever heeded
The lying and the faking
The lying and the waiting
It's hardly surprising
Too busy socialising

The lying and pretending
But you don't even try

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Now

A car without an engine
A plane without a pilot
It's hardly surprising
Too busy socialising
The lying and the faking
Fake
Fake
Fake

Where are you

Where are you now

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you
Where are you now
