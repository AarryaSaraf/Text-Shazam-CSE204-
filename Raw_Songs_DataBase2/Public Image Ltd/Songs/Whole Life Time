We have a blood
Scaled to travel
Just let it clickle in the mind
Just to know
It learn
And hold it, oh!
Even seems unkind

It takes a whole lifetime
Me saying to you
It takes a whole lifetime
Oh what happened to me

It when like nothing happened
But something happened alright
But it weren't alright
And it's still not
Not
What happened to me

It takes a whole lifetime
Me saying to you
It takes a whole lifetime
Oh what happened to me

Well lost and found
We found
Another other
In each other
And this love and lust and anger
And the rage and the coincidences
In the sentence until the pages have sense
Picture the puzzle
