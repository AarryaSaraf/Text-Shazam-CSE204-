Could have been a major problem
But I did not - I didn't look back
And all you dirty druggies
Chicken shit - sad sacks
Rewriting history
Tampering in my story
Standing in my shadow
But still so pale, so shallow

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, loser takes blank

Mother nature's kind regards
Balancing the house of cards
Assuming and consuming
Of the peg commodities
The politics of common sense
Violence as self defense
Smiles and metaphors
The languages of lesser whores

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, I'll let you dream

Dream on
I might no know much - but I know all this
Did you think I would not notice
Dream on

Love loves money and delights in praise
Easy money as a virtue, just watch it quickly fade
And it could have been a problem
But I did not - I don't look back

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, loser takes blank
Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, I'll let you dream
Dream on
