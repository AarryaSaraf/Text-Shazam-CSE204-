None of us are the enemy
And they are the same as you and me
Save for the trick of education
And the parental politician
People what are you doing here?
Who are you listening too, and who are you looking up into?
Are you looking up into?
If these are your leaders, they're not good enough for you

Because I'm human
I've just been thinking
About getting it right

I'm only seeking
And to fight the good fight

I'm only seeking
Because I'm human
Listen to me, they are not good enough for you
Human!
It's like looking across the great divide
Trapped in a class system
It's pushed you all aside
All to the left, all to the right
Your doomed to slip, doomed to slide
Because I think: England's died
Because I think: England's died
Most of all, above the screaming and the poseurs here
I miss the roses
Those English roses, of salad and beer and summer here
And many mannered ways
Of cotton dresses
Skipping across the lawn
Of happy faces, when football was not a yawn
And clear the bomb sites, and all the days were long
November into winters here, snows would turn my page
But school was always torture here
Derision turns to rage
Because I'm human, I've just been thinking
About getting it right

I'm only seeking
Because I'm human
