A bed in the corner
The suffering suffragette
Such an obvious trap
Imagine that
A Butterball turkey
Spread her body
Naked and silly
A bulbous heap
Batting her eyelids
The lights go down
Erupting in fat
The blackwall tunnel
An elephant's grave
A second-hand mattress
Come and play total commitment
Premenstrual tension

Alright, I finished
