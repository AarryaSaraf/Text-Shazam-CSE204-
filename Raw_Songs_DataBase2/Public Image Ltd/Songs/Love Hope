I can see potential
I can see intention
With a pocket full of seeds
Hope keeps me alive
I can see contention
Financing situations
And maybe may never be

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

Love bites trivia severely
It has to be treated with respect
And taken seriously, seriously, lonely
I want to belong

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

I want to belong...

Nothing comes from nothing
No wisdom than the silence
Negotiable affections
Even lovers need lessons

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on
Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

I want to belong...
