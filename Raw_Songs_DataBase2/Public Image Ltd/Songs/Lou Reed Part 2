Hello...

Where are you?...

So now you keep your distance
Double on the nuisance
Avoid the situation
Avoid your occupation
Hardly surprising
Too busy socialising
The lying and the faking
The lying and the waiting

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you now

You're never here
When you're needed
Nothing ever heeded
Pretending and pretending
But you don't even try

Where are you
Where are you now

A car without an engine
A plane without a pilot

Where are you
Where are you now

Where are you
Where are you now
