Jackson stood 'cause he could
'Cause he should looking good
To the woods and the stood, to the wood understood

Well here we are the unfar
As you are, here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are

Up to the woods as we should
Through the wood, secret would, secret should, secret would understood
Through the wood

And as we march far as far
What last dark from my heart
Secrets could in the woods, through the woods

Jackson could understood they they are
Here we are come too far secrets are
Ready are, ready are, ready are

Well,  bullets are, soldiers are, horses are
Jackson could 'cause he should from the wood

Jackson could 'cause he understood the dead I are
And here we are come so far, secrets are, ready are
