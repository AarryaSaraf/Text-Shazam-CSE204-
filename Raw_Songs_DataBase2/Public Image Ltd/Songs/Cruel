Body and soul, an animal
As a sword, swing double edged
Dig deep down, that monthly frown
You have the tools, to make men fools

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(It's so cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Cleopatra, the rat catcher
Preambling eyeball shopping
Measuring, your next victim
Too good to be sin, far too entertaining

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(You're so cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(So cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel

She said, "The most evil thing I can do
Is to give my body to you"

Silhouette, the suffragette
Behind the scenes the deadly schemes
Your best nightmare, without a prayer
From ship to shore paramour amour

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(So cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Inside our head, twenty two to lead
The modern miss, with modern gifts
In the tragedy hilarity
Never sin, far too entertaining

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
