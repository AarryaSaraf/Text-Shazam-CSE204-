The path that lends
To the way by the sea
Away from the harbour
Where their eyes cannot see

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

Well hid are the cattle
From the long ship the enemy
All of us are abandoned here
And branded to pity

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

The gods have spoken
You can see them in me
We're all together
In our sandals by the sea

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge

Gather little children
Gather around me
Don't tell your parents
They'll steal your destiny

I'll see you there
You'll be seeing me
Early morning in the fog
The depth of misery

Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
Welcome to Penge
