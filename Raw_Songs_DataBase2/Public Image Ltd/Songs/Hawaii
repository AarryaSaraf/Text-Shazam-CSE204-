Falling in our hearts
Here again, Hawaii
We're here, you and me

Aloha (aloha), well hello there
Aloha, Hawaii (hawaii)
Aloha, well hello there
Hawaii

All journeys end
Some begin again
We're here, you and me
Hawaii (hawaii), remember me
I remember you, Hawaii (hawaii)
Hawaii (hawaii), remember me
I remember you, Hawaii

Don't fly too soon
No need to cry, in pain
You are loved
Again again
Hawaii
You and me
All those good times

Aloha (aloha)
Well hello there
Aloha Hawaii (hawaii)
You are loved
Hawaii
Remember me, I remember you
Hawaii, Hawaii
Remember me, I remember you
Aloha (aloha)
Hawaii
