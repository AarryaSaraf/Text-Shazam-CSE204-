I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night

I'm not an actor
I cannot hide away
Whatever I want to say
I let it out
Maybe I'm wrong
The games you play
Go on too long

I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night

I put my foot in it
I said the wrong thing
I opened my mouth
I let the rubbish flow out

I wish that sometimes
I wouldn't talk so blind
And I always guess
The hard rules of life
