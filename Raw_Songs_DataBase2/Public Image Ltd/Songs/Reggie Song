And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
He don't see no evil, just Eve and Adam
And only innocence, but in the garden
Acting the, man
He is a new sense
You've been dreaming, we've all been dreaming
We see no reason for leaving the, shine
We trying like, shine
There are no bad seasons, no reason for leaving

And so we shine, so we shine, now shine
You see Reginald, he is a reasonable man
And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
You see Reginald, he is a reasonable man
And being uncomfortable, with a bit of a later plan
He don't see no evil, just Eve and Adam
And only innocence, but in the garden

Shining like a beacon in the garden of Eden
There are no bad seasons, no reason for leaving
And if you shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden
No reasons for leaving, shine

Many of us come from London
But no matter where you come from

Shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden

And while you wait for the penny to drop

And you do not know the

Back in the garden

And so we like a beacon in the garden of Eden, shine
There are no seasons, no reason for leaving
Shine like a beacon in the garden of Eden, shine
I've been seeing no reason for leaving
I've been dreaming, see no reason
