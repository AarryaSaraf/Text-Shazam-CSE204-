With the fly in my eye
It didn't take long
To realise
The desert sun
Might be good for some
Oh no, not for I

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel

I get bored in the brain
Out here, doing nothing at all
Some useless holiday
This turned out to be
The dinner gave me
The splattery botty

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel

Burning, all day long
I, I don't belong,
Itching in frustration
This, is not my ideal vacation

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel
