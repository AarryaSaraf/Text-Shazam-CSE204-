What does it mean, what does anything mean
Sending out signals I see the smoke screens
What is not dirty, what is not clean
What should we not hear, what shouldn't be seen
Running off verbals like a runaway truck

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
Forget me, forget me not
Remember me like acid drops

Mind over morals, anything banned
The zealots are marching with Bible in hand
Keyed to the roof 100 proof
Some of them hairpins, some of them clams
Desperate Susans, desperate Dans

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
You read but missed my plot
You only see that what is not

These are clueless, living in fear
Scared of their own sex or anything clear
Still looking down proboscis crown
Vague hope and no charity - welcome to the 21st century

The hush puppy hushes, a dummy dumb struck
What is bad language, what shouldn't be heard
Or used as a token or used as a word
What is not dirty, what is not clean
What is not filthy, what is obscene

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
Forget me, forget me not
Remember me like acid drops

These different colours, different style
Different cultures - these blend in a while
Prejudice prods through a big picket fence
Divided we fall without a defense

The seat of easement, the privy parliament
Petticoat merchants bent on intent
There everywhere, these tricks of the trade
Some in the light, some in the shade
