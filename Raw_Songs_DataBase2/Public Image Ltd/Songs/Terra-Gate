Matters you are, you probably fake
Interrogate into hate operate tomorrow terra-gates
And what you take
What you make
And what you hate you probably fake
Put other  like in something to take
And like an  one drop at the time
All I could terra into hate

Take what you make what you hate into gray
Into hate, it's too late into fake
What's your gate, what's your gate, what's your gate separates

And if for a million turn to reject
And they expect suffering suffer hate
Separate separate separate separates

Madness you are, interrogate into hate, operate into hate, operate
Tomorrow it's too late
And it's terra into terra-gate

Take what you make what you hate into gray
Into hate, it's too late into fake
What's your gate, what's your gate, what's your gate separates

Separates I know it's time
I'm taking enough friends

Whipping running wanting me out
Like you got something to tell
I like you got to tell are you tearing me out

Swell and well for personality
Will never blondy you through
Not this time, you're in my own time
And I  enough now out of you
You can go but you cannot stay, no

I want no more out to you
Another four on the other two
You're too late
You can go now if you want to now
But you cannot stay
You cannot stay
Another you 
No wake up in your 

And take away into fight share the gate separate
What you may understand tell the gate
Terra hate, terra gater, you go gater separate
Too late
