I can see
I can see when our hands are tied
I was a victim when you lied
Attack
Attack attack attack attack attack
I was a victim of your pride
I will survive 
Attack, attack
You who smile back legislated
You who made me stupid hatred
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack attack
You who made me ignorant
You will face the consequences
Attack

You who sits on golden arses
Tinkering your cocktail glasses
You who smiled so politely
You who make us so unsightly
You who used your money taking
Attack, attack, attack attack attack attack attack
You who tax and persecute
You who guarded all the loot
Attack
Attack
Attack
All our deals confiscated
Legaling with magistrate
Attack
Attack

You who buried me alive
I will survive 
Attack
Attack
Attack
Destroy
Eliminate
Wipe out
Burn
Gave me your manure
Made me insecure
Attack
Attack attack attack attack attack
Attack
Attack
