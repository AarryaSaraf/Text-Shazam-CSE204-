Maybe you have
Or maybe you can struck with me
Somebody there
Or maybe they are with me
And in the embers veil
Get up in the fire
So when the boat comes in
You're not be the one
So when the boat comes in
You're not be a clown
Yeah you got that one
You're not be a clown

You're not the one
Wondering
Where you can put that sun
Under the moon
Or maybe I'll be home

Like a modern man
With a full feather plan
A powerful man
Not an ordinary plan

You're not the one
Am in a foreign land
With a hand full of sand
It's in the palm of my hand

Be there when I can
You're that one

Maybe you're the one
Yeah maybe you're the one
Maybe you're the one
Yeah maybe you're the one
One
