I think you need me now
From chapter to chapter
I'll never let go
I have an appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice
...

Admire the scenery
It's where I left it last
This room now has a view
It's nearly night at last
The ceiling seal of ice
These walls and windows have your eyes
Almost a honeymoon
I feel clean inside

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful

I think you need me now
I'm from chapter to chapter
I never let go
I had this appetite
Follow these rules of life
Never the same thing twice

Admire the scenery
It's where I left it last
This room now has a view
It's nearly night at last
The ceiling seal of ice
These walls and windows have your eyes
Almost a honeymoon
I feel clean inside

I'm safe inside this body
Body beautiful
This body beautiful
Body beautiful

This body beautiful
This body beautiful
This body beautiful
