// Four Enclosed Walls //

Alla
Alla
Doom sits in gloom in his room
Destroy the infidel
In a mosque
In a ghost
Is a sword
Is a Saracen
Alla
Joan of Arc was a sorcerer
The trilogy, the desert sand
Scriptures in the tower of Babel
Alla

Only ending is easy
Burn
Burn
Burn
In the tower
Only ending is easy
Alla

Arise in the East
The trilogy
Alla
Alla
I take heed
Arise in the West
A new crusade

// Track 8 //

A bed in the corner
The suffering suffragette
Such an obvious trap
Imagine that
A Butterball turkey
Spread her body
Naked and silly
A bulbous heap
Batting her eyelids
The lights go down
Erupting in fat
The blackwall tunnel
An elephant's grave
A second-hand mattress
Come and play total commitment
Premenstrual tension

Alright, I finished

// Phenagen //

Down in the dark
Tell us a story
From the room below
You are an ostrich
Bury your head
Personal Auschwitz
Fermenting in bed
Empty promises help to forget
No more, no more
Repair the damages you made
Amen, amen, amen, amen

Empty promises help to forget
No more, no more
Amen, amen, amen

// Flowers Of Romance //

Now in the summer
I could be happy or in distress
Depending on the company
On the veranda
Talk of the future or reminisce
Behind the dialogue
We're in a mess
Whatever I intended
I sent you flowers
You wanted chocolates instead
The flowers of romance
The flowers of romance

I've got binoculars
On top of Box Hill
I could be Nero
Fly the eagle
Start all over again
I can't depend on these so-called friends
It's a pity you need to defend
I'll take the furniture
Start all over again

// Under The House //

It came out of the wall
A single cadaver
Under the house
It went under the house
Scream in the trees
Under the moon
Scream in a dream
Solid the grave
Vile stinking
Stone cold ambition
Solid and gross
It went under the house
It's not the sun I wear as a crown
I colour the clouds
Under the house
Solid the grave
Stone cold ambition
Solid discreet
It came out of the wall
A single cadaver
It went under the house
A scream in the trees
Under the moon
Ages apart
Under the house
It's not the sun I wear as a crown
I follow the clouds
Under the house
Scream in the trees
Under the moon
It came out of the wall
A single cadaver
It went under the house
The jugular bulge rips
Steal if I could
Under the house
Ages apart
Under the house
Scream in the trees
Stone cold ambition
Solid discreet
Under the moon
Under the house
It went under the house
Under the house
A scream in the trees
Under the moon
The vile stink in my nostril
A single cadaver
Stone cold ambition
It clouded out of the wall
Solid disgrace
The smoke is a float
It's not the sun that I wear as a crown
Every breeze brings disease
Ages apart
Under the house
Mercenary

// Banging The Door //

Hello

What do you want?
You're irritating, go away
It's not my fault
That you're lonely
Just look around
I think you'll find that everyone has the same problem
This is not a real home
The walls are so thin
The neighbours listen in
Keep the noise down
They're complaining
Humiliated
You were born and bred
Humble to the spoon-fed
Why worry now? You're not dead yet
You've got a whole lifetime to correct it
You're wasting
Admiring hating
This lot are not happy heroes
Just better actors
A-hundred-and-one dilations
And fifty-seven varieties
Outside with the empties
Keep banging the door
Keep banging the door
Keep banging the door
I won't answer the phone
I won't answer the door
Reptilians
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in

(All right, stop Nick)
This is not a real home
The walls are so thin
The neighbours listen in
Keep the noise down
They're complaining
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here
I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in, I won't let you in, I won't let you in
Won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
Keep banging the door, keep banging the door, keep banging the door, keep banging the door
I won't answer the phone, I won't answer the door
Keep banging the door

// Go Back //

Left
Right
Left
Right
Don't look back
Take second best
Number one protect self interest
Here every day is a Monday
Monday
Left, right
Left, right
Left, right, left, right
Get it up, get it up, get the right armour
Don't look back
Look after your health
Good days ahead
Don't listen to the red refugees
Aliens
Go back, go back, go back, go back

Extreme right
The face is white
Left foot, right foot
Keep the shoulders up
Column eighty-eight
The master plan
Uber alles
The Ku Klux Klan
Improvements on the domestic front
Have a cup of tea, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, good days ahead

Don't look back, good days ahead
Don't look back, good days ahead
Don't ever look back, improvements on the domestic front
Good days ahead
Don't ever look back
Good days ahead

// Home Is Where The Heart Is //

Home

I got the oven repaired
This was security in luxury
Home is where the heart is
The daily paper and the carpet

My body burns
My body needs to follow suit
Blind lead the blind
From Russia with love
I look good in dust

Shadow in the back of the hall
The images of everyone
Isn't nature such a wonderful thing
Spreading all over the world
By geography
I'm not a stranger

My fingers burn
My body burns
I'm practicing
I'm separating

I look good in dust

My body burns
My body needs to follow suit
Blind lead the blind
From Russia with love
I look good in dust

I look good in dust

Spreading all over the world

I got the oven repaired
This was security in luxury
Home is where the heart is
The daily paper and the carpet

My body burns

Shadow in the back of the hall
The images of everyone
Isn't nature such a wonderful thing
Spreading all over the world
By geography
I'm not a stranger

My fingers burn
My body burns
I'm practicing
I'm separating

I've had enough

// Another //

Someone made the story up
I tell the truth
It wasn't me
Let me in
I won't be long
Open doors
Feel the draft
Someone made the story up the next day

Being here
Is not enough
Another
Another
Another

I tell the truth
It wasn't me
Follow the leader
I can't be patient
I am a shadow
Coming
Another

Another...

It don't [?]
Real as a statue
[?]
Easy
Another

Being here
Is not enough

Being here
Is not enough
Let me in

Another
Another
Another
