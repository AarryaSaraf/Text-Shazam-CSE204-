Album: WhatTheWorldNeedsNow

// Double Trouble //

What? You fucking nagging again?
About what? What? What?
The toilet's fucking broken again
I repaired that, I told you
Get the plumber in again
And again and again and again and again and again and again

Don't throw me to the Moon
And don't put me in a bubble
And don't come to me for a cuddle
'Cause all I want is the trouble, trouble, trouble

Give me a row, right now
We'll stir it up and clear the air
On what is what, it's only fair

I want the trouble trouble trouble
On the double double double
Give me trouble
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Don't want no pedestal
Don't want to be feeling small
Don't leave a stain on my name
Trouble is the end of the shame

// C'est La Vie //

C'est la vie
C'est la vie
So c'est la vie
Dead and gone
All those times now
You're dead wrong
You are like kissing me now
You are secret coward
A golden shower
Of empty melodies
That lost their power
So c'est la vie
You left nothing for me
Your only enemy
Your how
Remember
When you use to rule the skies
When in my eyes
Been writing this letter all day long
Well what went wrong
You moved alarm
Now what went wrong
Trying to take good byes
Ba bye ba bye
Of your hand
Of hope sound high
Until your nose can block the sky
Until you've eaten every piece of the pie
As killer where you'll killed us all with your lies
Old enemy mine
Go home
Dead and gone
You're wrong
They're false truth
C'est la vie
Good bye good bye
Bye bye
Good bye now
Bye bye
C'est la vie
So c'est la vie
Me spy a vision
Oblivious sublivion
666 in all nations
Sick by separation
Sharing and caring
Can you imagine the intention
Just understanding
An ignition reversing
I can't give this part a title
That would be food for the foolish
Can you try your luck now
For the last human standing
Is this civilization expanding
Or the final yawn of an ending
The ending

// Spice Of Choice //

You must have move to the beat
Of a different fella
Well whatever
Have to change in the weather
And as a mover, a docker, a diver when through
Yeah
You get what you deserve I hope
Cause life a lesson a waiting to be learned

You get to choose your life
You get the spice of choice
You get to lose your life
You get the grief and a voice

You get the heaven in your voice
You get to choose your life
You get the spice of choice
You get to lose your life
You get the heaven in your voice

Confess self obsession
You're a spender at a sperm
Extreme in exhibition
You are this family has a plan
Thanks to you I was part of these plans
Must have plan master by sand
Away we go
And all the better whatever
Away we go

You don't know ever been when you asking me about
What the fuck are you arguing about
So
Am I in or am I out
Am pushing in and you're pulling out
Well like it or not
Coming out of your mouth
Not too long you just shout about
You see the way we are
You're nearly there
You're nearly clever

And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are

// The One //

Maybe you have
Or maybe you can struck with me
Somebody there
Or maybe they are with me
And in the embers veil
Get up in the fire
So when the boat comes in
You're not be the one
So when the boat comes in
You're not be a clown
Yeah you got that one
You're not be a clown

You're not the one
Wondering
Where you can put that sun
Under the moon
Or maybe I'll be home

Like a modern man
With a full feather plan
A powerful man
Not an ordinary plan

You're not the one
Am in a foreign land
With a hand full of sand
It's in the palm of my hand

Be there when I can
You're that one

Maybe you're the one
Yeah maybe you're the one
Maybe you're the one
Yeah maybe you're the one
One

// Big Blue Sky //

Yeah
Yeah
I look, and I road
Memory road
Yeah
Yes I rode
And I rode
And I rode
And I rode
Well
I am surprised that the sun awoke a tall
With a blood bathe in the moonlight
Left me at first
Exilierated
Now I feel small
Killing everything
Look and walk run or crawl
I don't feel human
At all
And I am sorry
Standing pained and shamed
And today or tonight
In might have to happen all over again
Am alive
I have a run
Under the big blue sky
The big blue sky
I know this land this slice into life is to survive
Face too red hot face in the sun
I have a place
I learn to love in a loveless place
Death lust and dust
Only my whole
Is the one I trust
The shadow is my compass
He leads me to the water
I lead him to his death
This is my promise
This is my promise
Under the clear blue sky
Under the big blue sky
The big blue sky
I rode into the clear moonlight
In the black of night
Under a thousand eyes
The savage craze of those cougar eyes
Until one of us dies
Under the big blue sky
Under the big blue sky
I rode
Under the pitiless hummm
Of that raging sun
Then I rode
Back to the dawn
Where the guns belong
Under the big blue sky
Where I will see
When I die
Sky
Sky

// Whole Life Time //

We have a blood
Scaled to travel
Just let it clickle in the mind
Just to know
It learn
And hold it, oh!
Even seems unkind

It takes a whole lifetime
Me saying to you
It takes a whole lifetime
Oh what happened to me

It when like nothing happened
But something happened alright
But it weren't alright
And it's still not
Not
What happened to me

It takes a whole lifetime
Me saying to you
It takes a whole lifetime
Oh what happened to me

Well lost and found
We found
Another other
In each other
And this love and lust and anger
And the rage and the coincidences
In the sentence until the pages have sense
Picture the puzzle

Check the puzzle...

// I'm Not Satisfied //

Well I'm not satisfied
Not in my head
Not scandalized not with what I said
I'm not compromised
I'm not satisfied
I'm not satisfied
I'm not much surprised
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied

I can't walk
And I can't talk
I'm with the pain
The suffering shame
Not satisfied
Why can't I
Remember your name
And got your name
And got your name
Not satisfied
Not in my head
This hospitalized bed
Might just be dead
Not satisfied
See I'm not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not compromised
Not satisfied
With what I said
Not satisfied

And then the drugs to ease the pain
But the drugs did not work
And I'm back again
Don't you want me
Well don't you know me
That I can't have it
I need your pain
Again and again and again
This suffering shame
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Why can't I remember your name
And got your name
Why and got your name
Not satisfied

// Corporate //

Our people killed
Our people have vision
No matter your color
You are family to me
Now put this all together
This is community
Even the other side of the planet
Is the other side of me
Are you here for me?
Well I'm here for you
And I am here for me

Get up off of the ground now
See fucking with you is fantastic now
Get up off of the ground now
Fucking me into a spastic now
Some of the times I can find you in the melodies
And some of the times I find you unwritten literally
But you are there and I hear you and I see
None of us is completely free
Well I am here for you
And I am here for me

Not global villages
But one globe
Not itty bitty little villages of pity and learning how to survive in the 21st century
And looking at world war 3
Because all humans seem to hate humanity

Oh, pity or suffer
Can we make the next century
This is your anthium
The lack of passion
Use some plenty one
Don't pay no for nothing
Are you the future
Corporate through wire
Don't know what you want to do
Why should I care for you
So young and dumb
Sack of potatoes
You're imitating now
The imitators now
You are the symphonies
You sell a kidneys
You are the world wide web
Welcome to the iCloud
End

This world you now live in
It is your own prison
It is the poison in your own soul
You made this all on your own
Mmh...
You murderer
