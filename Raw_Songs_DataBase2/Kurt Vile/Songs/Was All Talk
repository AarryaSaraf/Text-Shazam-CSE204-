Spirit in the sky
Transparent to the eye
Talkin' trash on nothin'
The human eye can see anyway
So that's anarchy for you and me
When outta this world is outta mind

There was a time in my life
When they thought I was all talk
Now I'm bein' stalked by God, walkin'
I got the upper hand, walkin'
Now take a look at my hands
Watch em go, watch me go
Yeah I'm goin', yeah I'm gone

Freak in the fog
Through the dew in the dawn
All the words you sang were wrong
Now won't ya watch me?

Left-handed smoke-shiftin'
For my right-hand man
Can you sense the snag in my plan?
Spirit in the ether
For my right-wing sister
Safe to say she don't get out that much

There is a time in my life that is
Gone I sometimes still go back to
Not to be all stalkin' myself too much
When I get the upper hand
Here, in present days
Now take a look at my hands
Watch em go, watch me go
Yeah I'm goin... yeah I'm gone

Freak in the fog
In the sea of the storm
Makin' music is easy:
Watch me
