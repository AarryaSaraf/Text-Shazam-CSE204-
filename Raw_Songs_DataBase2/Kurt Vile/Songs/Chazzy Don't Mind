Strummin' a song
That teapot wants to sing along but
I don't mind
No, I don't mind

Write about what you see around you
Children and flowers
And days for hours
Songs for miles

And I don't mind
No, I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

My girlfriend's Chazzybelt
They got a song like this too, prolly, but
I don't mind
No, I don't mind
I don't
I don't mind

My mind is hummin'
When I walk I'm dreamin', riding skateboards downhill

Smooth hiss of brand new blacktop swells
All just from, well
I'm really just lookin' outside from inside
Leanin' on my windowsill

Strummin' a song
That teapot sings in a beautiful falsetto
And I don't mind
I don't mind
Oh, I don't mind
Oh, I don't mind
