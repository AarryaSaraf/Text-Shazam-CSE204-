Where you been now, little girl?
Where you been now, little girl?
Did you get your purse all filled with pearls?

Where'd you go out all alone?
Where'd you go out all alone?
Why'd you come back looking stoned?

Where you been now, little girl?
Where you been now, little girl?
Roamin' in your own little world?

I see your eyes all filled with sin
I can see you in it up to your chin
Tell me, girl, now where you been?
