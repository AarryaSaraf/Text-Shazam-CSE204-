Standing on top of Mount Airy Hill
Thinkin 'bout, flyin'
Been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm goin' down

I was flyin' high through the night when the mornin' came
But I was gone, if you know, what I mean
I was around but now I'm gone
Been done down but now I'm just way down low
(Watch my moves)

He do the snake in the grass
He do the wiggle it around now, way down low
I been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm just way gone
I been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm way gone

I been around but now I'm gone (Yeah)
Been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm-a-just way gone
(Watch my moves)

He do the snake in the grass
