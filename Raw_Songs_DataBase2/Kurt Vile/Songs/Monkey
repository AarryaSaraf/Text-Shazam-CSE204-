Oh, my darling
I was born when I met you
If you don't mind now would
I lie could I get you to redesign
And redeliver me again

I'll be your baby
And I'll be your father
Your little brother
Won't be no bother
Just born in autumn
Came and I am here

I see you saw me
In the mirror in half
It's so exciting that we both
Just laugh and laugh

The other night you were away
I missed you so bad
I found me doing something
Desperate, I was so sad
I swear I held my own hand
Pretending it was yours

Oh, my monkey love is funny
When it's so strong
It's so strong and it goes on
For so, so long
And it's long and strong
And funny and it pours
