Palace of OKV in reverse
Dreamin' up a storm in my soul
There's a great flood of blood
Pumpin' through to my heart
That goes out to the world

Dreamin' dreams or was it real or was it only just a dream?

Second verse same as the reverse
Was it real or was it only but a dream?
Dreamin' up a storm in my soul
There's a great flood of blood then of course, well, all the rest

Standin' on top of the world when it's startin' to burn

And that's the way that I feel with my head down on the pillow sometimes

Palace of OKV in reverse gets unbuilt
Roots pulled back down in the ground
