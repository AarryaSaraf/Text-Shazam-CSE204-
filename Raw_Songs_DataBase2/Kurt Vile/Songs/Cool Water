Hey, where you goin' now?
Are you goin' home?
Where is that at, baby?
I, I been thinkin'
I been drinkin'
I been dyin' and craving some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

Wait, wait your turn
And do ya got something to burn?
'Cause now, now is the time
To smoke 'em if you got 'em
But when, when you're done
Bite your tongue and put out the cherry with some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

Hey, where you going now?
Are you goin' home?
Where is that at, baby?
'Cause I, I been thinkin'
And I been drinkin'
For a while
But when you're done bite your tongue and
'Cause now I could use some, we all could use some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

But a one Marty Robbins slayed with the brothers Glaser
