Go ahead tell me hello or fuck you
Whatever introduction suits you
I ain't tryin' to fight
I'm just tryin' to ride this train to make it home tonight

Hey, I don't get it kid
Are you tryin' to break my nose
Or just stand around and stare me down in calm?
Where the hell do you get off anyway?

Well, there's people out there who tell you lies
They get off on giving wrong direction
Well, fabrication's my best friend
But I ain't never been so insulted in my whole life

Ridin' on the freak train, train, train, train
Well, there's a whole new story there

Let it hang out like you just don't care
And drag it everywhere, woo

One day I'm gonna get me enough gold to get me
Where I wanna go comfortably
They say sellin'  is a little faster but uh
But now it's freaks howlin' woo get off me

There's a man with hands for every finger claimin' he's a folk singer
And he's raring to bite his nails
Think I'd rather ride the rails
Ridin' on the freak train
