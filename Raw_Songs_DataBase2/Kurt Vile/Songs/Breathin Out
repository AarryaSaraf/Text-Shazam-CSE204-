Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
You can only argue with yourself for so long
Through my body or my brain I got myself insane

Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
You can only argue with yourself for so long
Through my body or my brain I got myself insane

Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

Ouch! Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh

Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
Was it action or emotion? Said we're traveling in the ocean
Oh, am I still alive? There ain't no hell or heaven

Hey, yeah, you got a little screw loose
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, did you forge your own signature?
No longer in the picture, there's no permanent fixture
Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

You take in it all and breathe it out slow
You take in it all and breathe it out slow
