When we fight, I wanna talk it out
You won't say nothin', nothin' at all
You just sit, there you won't open that pretty mouth
I think you like keeping my back up against the wall

Wages of sin you keep me payin'
Wages of sin for the wrongs that I've done and
Wages of sin you keep me payin'
Wages of sin, one by one

I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place
You're crouched in the corner with make-up runnin' down your face and
I don't wanna believe what my, what my heart keeps sayin'
You keep me on the line so you can keep me payin'

Wages of sin, yeah we keep payin'
Wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done and
Wages of sin, yeah we keep payin'
Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun

I remember when I was a little boy out where cottonwoods grow tall
Tryin' to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Baby, all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real
I was runnin' down that broken path with the devil snappin' at my heels
And I tried so hard, so hard in every way
Swore some day I'd grow up and just throw it all away
Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry
Stomached all my fears 'til they just rushed up inside
Darlin', I'm losing and it's a mean game
Still, I play on and on just the same

Wages of sin, yeah I keep payin'
Wages of sin for some wrongs that I've done and
Wages of sin, yeah I keep payin'
Wages of sin, one by one
