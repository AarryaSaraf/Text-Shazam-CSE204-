She's a three-wheel maybe baby high-strung well-off...
She's a three-wheel maybe baby high-strung well-off in the brains and she means  well
She's a little bit skinny mini girl child old soul she grown up real well
She'll chew you out if you deserve it man, but I kinda like it and I really love her
She's a little bit skinny mini, stay that way, baby girl and I love her so
Never gonna let her go, no no no

She got a wild brain sometimes, but so do I sometimes, and I don't know why, you gotta
She wanna, clean up the world but I'm drowning in dirt
I wanna, clean up the world but I can't
I wanna, give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind

She's a skinny little, scraffy little, all good , always means well, baby girl, dandelion, flower child
All substence, no jive talkin, fast walkin, girl babe
You might wanna, roll her up in a ball and eat her in a sandwich, but it's mine man
She's a little bit skinny mini, capricorn, can-o-worms, baby girl
I wanna, give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind
