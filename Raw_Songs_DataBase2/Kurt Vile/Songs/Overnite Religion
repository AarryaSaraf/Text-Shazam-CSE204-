You were all alone got into this song
Anyway it's strung to, it wont quit
Never mind time, let the good times

Hear my my guitar, chiming and climbing
Finding all the notes that nobody wrote
In all that time, making it my religion

Thinking is rhyming
And click track timing
Finding all the words, that nobody's heard
And in that time, emitting my sweet vision

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Talking and strumming
Swooning and tuning
When you looking sick, I'll alleviate it
Each chord I lay a shape
Make you awake, before you break

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Keep all along
I wrote you this song
For the one's I know made it back
For the friend's I haven't had
For my sisters, brothers moms and dads
They are all my friends in a church beneath my chest
Hanging over me all night, it's alright

I'm digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion
Comes to me like, like
It comes to me like, yeah
