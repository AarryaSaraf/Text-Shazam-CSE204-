And it was the blood inside
That opened up my eyes
And the knick-knacks started riots on the shelves
Trumpets blew themselves

And as the milk dribbled down my chin, I began to sin
And I felt myself come alive
And I breathe, and I breathe
Die

And it was the blood all around
That stood me up and knocked me down

And the kids playing shadow tag in the park
Watch each other die when it's getting dark
Chemical swish in their minds
They're then of a different kind

And the silhouette kid swinging on the swing
Scrapes his knee and blood it brings
And he shows his friends
He's alive

And I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I die
And I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I die
And I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I...
And I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I breathe, and I...
And I breathe, and I breathe, and I...
