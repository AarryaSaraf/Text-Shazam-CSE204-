(Got me goin'... 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2...)
Got me goin' "woo"...

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones
Thoughts runnin' round in my cranium like pinball machine-a-mania
Dreamin' of a time when everything rhymed and I was cool, calm and collected
And all my heroes dropped by just to hear me play

Thoughts become pictures, become movies in my mind
Welcome to the KV horror drive in movie marathon
But I'm just kiddin' and I'm just playin'
And this is just the way that I'm makin' a living
Everyday... In my mind and in real life too

Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"
Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"

Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"
Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"

("Takin' off now...")
("Moog makin' noise now...")

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones

("And guitars feedin' back now...")
("Feedback massaging my cranium")

Painful calculations bruise my brain in the pouring rain
Baby red maples growin' in the hedges
Sometimes the silver linings come in brown and red
So to see with your eyes you gotta turn your head to the light
You gotta see with your eyes to look at what's outta sight

Outta sight

(Sight)

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones
