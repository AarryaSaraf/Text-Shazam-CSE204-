There's been but one true love
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
And I got the hands to hold on to them

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Hide in my baby's arms
'Cause except for her you know
As I've implied

I would never, ever, ever be alone
'Cause it's all in my baby's hands
Shining, shining secret stones
In my baby's hands, in my baby's hands

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Shrink myself just like a Tom Thumb
I hide in my baby's hands
Hide in my baby's hand

'Cause except for her
There's just nothing to latch on to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There's been but one true love
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
My baby's arms, in my baby's arms

Oh yeah, oh yeah, my baby's arms
