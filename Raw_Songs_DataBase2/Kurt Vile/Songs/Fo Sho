Even if I'm wrong
Even if I'm wrong
Gonna sing-a-my song
'Til the break o' dawn like "Woo"

But even 'cause I'm real
Even 'cause I'm real
Even 'cause I'm real
Gonna peal another smash poem
Out a yellow legal pad for ya, baby
While I can

Even if it's sike
'Cause I know that I'm right
And I been doin' this a long time
Since before I was born

And it's prolly gonna be another
Prolly gonna be another long song
Prolly gonna be another long song

Even if I'm wrong
Gonna sing-a-my song
'Til the ass crack o' dawn

And it's prolly gonna be another long song
Long song
Long song
Long song
