You come home late and you come home early
You come home big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home curly
Sometimes you d-don't come home at all

Well what in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well I got a heart that a-burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind?

Well what in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well it's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow?
You ain't got no word to say

So what in the world has come over you?
What the hell you th-think you d-done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run

Run
