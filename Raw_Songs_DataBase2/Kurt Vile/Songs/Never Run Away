You had it all my day, you had it all
You had it all my day
Each morning we marry,
It's just the most gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away!
You met a young man who was a wild child
who harmonizes keys in his droning mind
Saxophone sings from inside his head cryin'

I know you'll never run away

I'm living all the time, thanks cause your mine
You turn my dying days away
Each day we carry on like believers and lovers
Though there are others who would rather run away

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
If you wanna hear a secret ...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Pay pay pay close attention

I know you'll never run away

Holding you all night through to the dawn
You turn my dying days away
My steady diet of high on love
Then taking dope to cope, had to come down sometime

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Pay pay pay close attention

I know you'll never run away
