I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line better be sure you'll be dead
You get up on top, these days you gotta a be a low-life drifter so
Slither up just like a snake upon a spiral staircase

Get your damn hands off of my land
Why don't you sock me and get off of my street
Cus I scared you out of your own shoes
Now I'm gonna tie'em together and hang'em on a wire
Til its junkies for hire
And I got a hunchback
