Society is my friend
He makes me laugh in a cool blood bay
Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cool blood bay

Oh, society
Oh, yeah

Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cold blood bay, yeah
He stole my lady's hand
Hey how you doin' this kids
My hand is not for you to hold
So kiss me with your mouth without closing it all that much

Society is all around
Are you the beautiful sound of all the half  pip-squeal
Ecstatic brilliance at it's finest, that's my friend
Society is all around
It takes me down

Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cold blood bay, yeah
Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down, down
