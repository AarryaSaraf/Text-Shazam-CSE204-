// I Know I Got Religion //

Yeah, I know I got religion
It took me away
It took me away
Yeah, relocating my caddy to the golden highway

Getting myself all cracked up on the poppy and pills
Cranberry orange vodka spills
But I can see those distant hills
And this is where I want to be
With human of her craft is made
Now everything I see like Jesus drafted me

Yeah, I dropped myself a penny off the william penn's head
Yeah, I watched the fall off the city hall
Yeah, I get my pictures [?] in seventy-six

Friends of the mind in a jar of the psychedelical kind
I won't be kind, I won't rewind
The friends that I had played too cool, I cut them off from the fire
Now I stopped using picks and not a thing between me and my guitar
Now I'm strumming away
Everyday when I feel blue I write a strummer for you
You yourself have said we can't get an ahead
But I said that you have won if we got religion
Religion, it's got me in its sway
It's got me in its sway

Yeah I know I got religion
It took me away
It took me away
Yeah, relocating my caddy to the golden highway

// I Wanted Everything //

I wanted everything [x3], but I think that I only got most of it

Lord willing and if the creek don't rise
I'm gonna love ya all the time
I ain't never gonna go to work no more
Kickin and screamin and
alright, I'm goin out the door

I wanted everything [x3], but I think that I only got most of it

Lord willing and if the creek don't rise
I'm gonna sit around til I get wise
I ain't never goin to go work no more
Cos I was an old man and that's all I ever did

I wanted everything [x3], but I think that I only got most of it

// Must Be Santa //

Who's got a beard that's long and white?
Santa's got a beard that's long and white
Who comes around on a special night?

Special night, beard that's white

Who wears boots and a suit of red?
Santa wears boots and a suit of red

Cap on head, suit that's red

// No Expectations //

So take me to the station
And put me on a train
I got no expectations
To pass through here again

Once I was a rich man
But now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love was like our music
It's here, and then it's gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again

// Run Run Run //

Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
"I sold my soul, must be saved
Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
You never know who you'll find there"

You gotta run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy death and you
Say, what you do?

Marguerita Passion, I had to get her fixed
She wasn't well, she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
Didn't know, thinks she could buy it

She gotta run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you what you do now

Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
They didn't know, they couldn't make the scene

You gotta run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you what you do
Now what you do?
Now what you do?
Now what you do?

Beardless Harry, what a waste
Couldn't even get a small-town taste
Rode the trolleys down 47th
Figured he was good to get himself to heaven

He had to run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy death and you
Tell you whatcha do

// Stranger Than Kindness //

Stranger than kindness
Bottled light from hotels
Spilling everything
Wet hand from the volcano
Sobers your skin
Stranger than kindness

You caress yourself
And grind my soft cold bones below
Your map of desire
Burned in your flesh
Even a fool can come
A strange lit stair
And find a rope hanging there
Stranger than kindness

Keys rain like heaven's hair
There is no home, there is no bread
We sit at the gate and scratch
The gaunt fruit of passion
Dies in the light
Stranger than kindness

Your sleeping hands journey
They loiter
Stranger than kindness
You hold me so carelessly close
Tell me I'm dirty
I'm a stranger
I'm a stranger
I'm a stranger to kindness

// Wounded Bird //

Like a wounded bird trying to fly
Surrounded by green fern, still a cozy and scenic place to die
Lately I've been flying high, then I guess I had to crash
Always did I love that I love that line
But never did I apply it to myself 'til just then

On the corner of our camping site, there's an entrance there to the woods
Watch my kids there as they play
While me, I'ma just pick away on a red Fender Palomino guitar for a change

My daddy was a railroad man, imagine all the miles of steel
He rode along his whole life long
Now I just put that in a song
My mother, she would mend our wounds while he was out along the track
Maybe try and clip our wings
Well, I remember everything
Like the red feather wingspan of some great majestic bird
Come flying over the horizon
Above a field of birds of paradise [?]
Or was it real? Or was it just a dream?
Or was it real or just a dream?
Just a dream
Whew

Like a wounded bird trying to fly
Surrounded by some trees in a cozy scenic place
Wish the world would stop and take notice of all the disgrace
But then breathe in quite deep and smell all the flowers while in bloom

Like a wounded bird trying to fly
Well, my daughter, she wrote that line
So copyright Awilda Vile
Like a wounded bird trying to fly
Like a wounded bird trying to fly
Trying to fly
Trying to fly
