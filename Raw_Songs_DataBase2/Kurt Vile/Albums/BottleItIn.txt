// Loading Zones //

Back is aching but I cannot sleep
'Cause I want to be like I am the mayor of some godforsaken town
Sure, they knighted me yesterday
But who needs armor when I've an exoskeleton?
I slip and squirm through the cracks
Creep around by all the loading zones in my dirty little town
Get my shopping done, laundry too
Drop some dead weight, clean my hands of what I need to clean my hands of
And all for free by mayoral decree
All from zone to loading zone of my town, yeah

Three grumpy girls and a dying daddy
But oh so gorgeous the way they crave
How beautiful to take a bite out of the world
I want to rip the world a new one
It just crawls out of my mouth anymore
You can hate on it or you can hug it
You can get all mushy and lovey-dovey
It's all the same when I'm out there driving around
All from zone to loading zone of my beautiful town

I park for free
One stop shop life for the quick fix
Before you get a ticket
That's the way I live my life
I park for free

I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free

// Hysteria //

Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details
Oh girl you gave me [?]
And I don't mean maybe

Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details
Oh girl you gave me [?]
And I don't mean maybe

Took a drink of head dream smoothie
All of a sudden I'm feeling very loopy
Don't you know I really love you now

Stop this plane cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out yeah
Watch me go, down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But [?] will get me now

Stop this plane cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out yeah
Watch me go, down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But [?] will get me now

Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details, just like
But [?] will get me now

// Yeah Bones //

(1, 2, 3, 4)

When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones over it
You'll only leave yourself lonesome
To show for it
When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones
Dyin' dead in a black sea of tears over me

When you're runnin' on the run
But you run, run too far [?]
Deep in the country while cats get shot at
When you're runnin' on the run
But you run too far
[?] rednecks with the shotgun shell (blast!)

When nobody calls me on the phone
Won't break your bones over it
I don't leave myself lonesome
To show for that
When nobody calls me on the phone
Won't break your bones
Dyin' dead in a black sea of tears over me
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)

// Bassackwards //

I was on the beach but I was thinking about the bay
Got to the bay but by then I was far away
I was on the ground but looking straight into the sun
But the sun went down and I couldn't find another one
For awhile
For because it was an all-burning feeling in my chest
To fill the void
Of a long night unwatched by, well, the sun
Until the morn
Until when, well, the sun's reborn
And so am I
From all the scorn buried deep
Within the psyche of my soul
I was standing down but I was also on the run
In my mind

I was on the radio talking with a friend of mine
There was no format because well, we like it like that
He was out of his mind and I was way out of mine
Then everything went backwards
With words coming out
Bassackwards
And I appreciate him to the utmost degree

I was on the beach but I was thinking about the bay
Got to the bay but by then I was far away
I was on the ground but looking straight into the sun
But the sun went down and I couldn't find another one
For a while
To fill the void
Until the morn
Then everything went backwards
I mean, phrases flying out
Bassackwards

I was on the moon but more so, I was in the grass
So I was chilling out but with a very drifting mind
So I was on the ground circa planet Earth
But out of sorts
But I snapped back, baby
Just in time to jot it down and come around
It's always nice to see you
And I came around
It's always nice to see you here when I come around
Or when I'm plain come, comin' down
Then everything goes backwards
I mean, everything moving out
Then everything goes backwards
I mean, everything oozing out
Bassackwards
(Strummin' a Chet Atkins)

I was standing up
But you know I hate to still stoop you down
To my level

Bassackwards
And I appreciate her to the utmost degree

Then everything went backwards
I mean, words coming out
Bassackwards

Just the way things is these days
Just the way they come out these days
Just the way things come out

To the utmost degree

// One Trick Ponies //

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names, they echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved them all through many a lifetime
Some are gone but some still strong
Some are weird as hell, but we love 'em
Some are one trick ponies but we embrace 'em
Cuz I've always had a soft spot for repetition

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names, they echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved you all a long, long time
Looked long into the length of a tunnel
Called all you names, and we was trippin out, cuz we needed a way out
And all them other crystalline mystic rationalizations

Loved them all right down to my soul
Looked well into the depth of a hole
Pondered perpetual motion in the echo
Just like the song if the repeats were long

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names, they echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved you all a long, long while
And I'd give my left nevermind for one big synchronized smile
Some are one trick ponies, but so am I
Round 'em up into a mixed bag bundle of love now

Loved them all a long, long tick
And it's four, five, six
Prevent your schtick
Throw them at the wall into a mixed bag and see if they stick
And give 'em a glass of water
Give 'em a cherry pie

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

// Rollin With The Flow //

(How's it goin'?)

Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead
Now somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd straighten up and do just fine
Aw, but I still love rock and roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Some might be callin' me a bum
But I'm still out there havin' fun
And Jesus loves me, yes, I know
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on)
(Keep on rollin')

While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
They forgive me of my sins

Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't never growin' old
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
I ain't ever growin' old
If I keep on rollin' with the flow
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin'

// Check Baby //

Check baby, check baby
One two three

Yeah check old man, check old man, check old man, check the cables and the chain
Yeah check baby, check baby
One two three
It's alright with me

Amphetamine, amphetamine
You know what I mean
She got a real kick to her
Yeah just like balls to the balls to the balls to the balls to the walls

Watch a man, watch a man, watch a man he walking around the world
Yeah it's like balls to the balls to the balls to the balls to the walls to the wall

Check baby, check baby

Hey, hey look look at me, always been in touch with the world obviously
Ah check old man, check baby, three four five

Yeah check old man, check old man, check all the cables in the chain
And get back at me, get back at me, when its safe to sling up my six-string
Then it's easy like
Four five six and your buddy got a pick

Check baby, check baby, all day round I was very lost but now I'm way [?] found
Yeah check brother, check brother check what a world we've inherited from another brother
What a whale of a pickle what a spell we are all pinned under
We give the devil a warm embrace and then we run like chickens from the [?]
But you wanna go to heaven when you d-I-e that's alright with me
It's easy like four five six and your buddy got a pick

Check it, old man

// Bottle It In //

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
Naw, you better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance we just can't take

You bottled it in
You bottled it in

You never got back at me when
When I most needed it
I would say I didn't mind
But you done it over and over
All the time
All the time
You better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance you can't take
Don't, don't don't don't- dammit

When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones over it
You'll only leave yourself lonesome to show for it
And that's somethin' you can't have

I wanted everything but I think that I got only most of it (hello hello hello)
But I think that I, I wanted everything
Aw yeah, black tongue
[Booger?] with a black and the whites of my eyes
Black tear on it down the sides
And black [?] the chest of my soul
And it was daytime but it was black, black outside
So you bottled it in (bottled it in)

Don't tell them
That you love them (that you love me)
For your own sake (for your own sake)
'Cause you never know when (when)
Your heart's a-gonna break
And that's a chance you just can't take (can't take, hello hello)
You bottled it in, never got back

Alright
When I most needed it
Alright
Yeah
All the time, all the
All, all the time

But I think that I only got most of it
But I think that I only got most of it
Yeah I think that I only got most of it
And I think that I
Saw a bottle of [?]
And I went to bed
And in the morning
I woke up with a black in the whites of my eyes
And a black tongue
Dragged down the sides

// Mutinies //

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pill and pill to try and make 'em go away
Small computer in my hand explodin'
I think things were way easier with a regular telephone-ment
Impunity and disillusionment
I guess we see now just how far that went
Jupiter and Saturn
Think I'm noticing a pattern

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pill and pill to try and make 'em go away
The little man in my head take over
Drive me man, then he'll drive away in a Land Rover

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pill and pill to try and make 'em go away
Small computer in my hand explodin'
I think things were way easier with a regular telephone-ment
Impunity and disillusionment
I guess we see now just how far that went
Jupiter and Saturn
Think I'm noticing a pattern

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pill and pill to try and make 'em go away
The little man in my head take over
Drive me man, then he'll drive away in a Land Rover (gone)

// Come Again //

Autumn come and winter gone
Then spring came all over the lawn
I wanna die then be reborn
Like seasons come and go and gone again

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
The world had better come around

I feel it in my chest
I feel it in my soul
The music and the whiskey
And it's warm and nurturing in a weird way
I feel it in my face right now when I sing
And it makes me wanna cry and scream and cry and

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
Could use a little help comin' around

Autumn come and winter go
Then spring sprayed all over, all we know
Then summer come in raging, brought my blood right to a boil
But even the heat too turned around and went
But it was a long one

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
The world had better come around
Come again, come again
Come again, yeah
Come again

// Cold Was The Wind //

Cold was the wind on my frozen face
But I didn't mind, cause I was long gone

Cold was the wind upon my brow
Below it, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, was the wind

Christmas in Siberia with the little bitty case of delirium trim
For some reason, picture Roger Clemens but [?] the city I came with
Crossed my heart, hoped to die
Stick a needle in my, butter around your bread

Cold was the wind upon my brow
Below it, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, wind, blows

Cold wind blows on my naked brow
Sun sits down on the sacred cow
You better God-damn miss me when I'm gone, cause guys gonna damn me up the [?]
Whoever it is, they're gonna give me the business
Whoever it is, gonna miss my girls
On the plane I'm drinkin red wine, like everybody else I'm afraid to die
Did I mention that I'm afraid of dying, think I heard my daughter crying
So I pick her on up, spin her around, live it on up, of what I found

Cold was the wind upon my brow
Below it, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, wind, blows

// Skinny Mini //

She's a three-wheel maybe baby high-strung well-off...
She's a three-wheel maybe baby high-strung well-off in the brains and she means [?] well
She's a little bit skinny mini girl child old soul she grown up real well
She'll chew you out if you deserve it man, but I kinda like it and I really love her
