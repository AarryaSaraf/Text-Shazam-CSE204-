Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

Dying mother forced to reconcile
A hellish landscape just to feed her child
Our interest waning, we desensitize
Abusive power now becomes enshrined

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

Shining skies will bring on death below
A compromising choice now rings hollow
Self-interest gaining, killing monetized
A million lives to boost the bottom line

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

My fear is teething
Through salt and sweat
The air decreasing
Burns with regret

My fear is teething
Through salt and sweat
The air decreasing
Burns with regret

Crumbled cities scattered far and wide
The myth of mercy buried deep inside

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones
Amongst the shadows and the stones
Amongst the shadows and the stones
