Take away all of this pain,
Life feels like it's all in vain,
Life feels like it's all in vain,
Blindingly, it seeps through the trees
Burning bright, subconscious streams
Falling light, dismantled dreams

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far. 
We were, never meant to make it this far. 


I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

We are all damaged and wrong,
Like to sing for death alone,
Like to sing for death alone,
Hope has gone cold with its cause,
Lost inside its every flaw,
Life is finally swallowed raw.

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far.

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

I'm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

With the end in sight,
I clench what's left of light
Press it against my head
And dream of the color red. 
And dream of the color red. 


I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

I'm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

I'm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far.
