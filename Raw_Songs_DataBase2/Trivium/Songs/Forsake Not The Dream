Been down this road
Too many times
Been down this road
Too many times

You taught me how
It feels to die
You taught me how
Feels to die

We learned
What it feels like
To feel pain
For the first time 
For the first time 


We learned
What it feels like
To suffer
Feels like to suffer

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

I watch it fall before my eyes
This ring we built for all our lives

We learned
What it feels like
To feel pain
For the first time

We learned
What it feels like
To suffer
Feels like to suffer

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

Vanquish that which kills you darling
Forsake not the dream
Through the world I feel I've fallen
Forsake not the dream

Crestfallen
Another crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Crestfallen
Another crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

Vanquish that which kills you darling
Forsake not the dream
Through the world I feel I've fallen
Forsake not the dream

Forsake
Forsake
Forsake
Forsake not the dream

Forsake
Forsake
Forsake
Forsake not the dream
