I'm calling out to you, can you hear me?
Numb and disconnected, just beyond your sight
I'm not myself anymore
But I'm not alone

I'm not alone
I'm not alone

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

I'm holding onto you, do you feel me?
Trapped but unaffected, like a memory
I'm waiting for a sign of life
And I can't let go

I can't let go
I can't let go

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

Is this the light or a distant mirror
You've kept me for yourself, that much is clear

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

What the dead men say
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
