Bleed my life to the concrete
Living is the strain
Cutting will from every vein
Conceived hate through the beatings
Your hate publicized
Shot for looking in your eyes

Throw my mind through dissection
Dismembering
Razorblade caressing

Consummation of falsehood
Feeding on their ways
Subhuman, be thy name

Headfirst, slammed to the concrete
Teeth grip the street
Inflamed rage you shall meet
Anger's smoke smells so sweet
Left torn and slain
Vengeance, be thy name

Throw my mind through dissection
Dismembering
Razorblade caressing

Cut scarred wrist
Drain you, pain
Shoot maimed mind
Kill you, pain

Pain

Cut scarred wrist
Drain you, pain
Shoot maimed mind
I'm in you

Pain
Pain
Pain
