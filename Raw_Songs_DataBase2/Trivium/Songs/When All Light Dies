In this chasm lying broken
Is a child charred inside
No more is there any hope
Shattered bones bloodied scars
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be

Prayed to be free
Broken on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
It's my only wish to die
Free myself from your reign of terror
So many times swear I died
Why won't the blood loss kill me
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be

Make me swear if I see your face again
I'd make you pay for the years of abuse
Fuck you
Tie you up make you bleed tear you apart
Limb from limb so many years I've held this in
I want to take your life
Make me swear if I see your face again
Tie you up make you bleed
Just like me
