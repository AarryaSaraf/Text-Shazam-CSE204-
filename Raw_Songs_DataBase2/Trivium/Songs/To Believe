As the innocent
Take the punishment
That was really meant
For every one of you

Claim immunity
From the misery
Bark your right to be
Wielding your weapons

Turned a blinded eye
As the children died
Lost within your lie,
Evil defines you

How can you not grieve?
I cannot believe
What has come to be
The land reeks of madness

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

It amuses me
That you fail to see
What has come to be
A paranoid nation

You cry "terrorist"
With a pounding fist
As your kind assists
Those who would end us

Your version of the truth
Will only benefit you
If you could only view
The dead all around us

You have brought it on
You're the guilty ones
Now we're running from
Our very extinction

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe
