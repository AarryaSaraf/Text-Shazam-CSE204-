I built these wings
With broken things
Found strewn in me
My nemeses

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I break and bleed
I tear, then feed
The wretchedness
Inside of me

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these
Eyes

Chaos

Reigns

It bites and holds
With fangs, so old
That loathsomeness
So bitter cold

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
