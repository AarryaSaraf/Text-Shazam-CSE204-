Point at the object
Of your new hate affection
Raped and slashed
Are now my hopes and dreams, oh, yeah
Drink up and marvel
You're my new hate infection
Loathing in my vision, nothing's as it seems
Take a mind, crush a soul

Thrust
Thrust
Thrust

Puke out, shoot in
Time for your masquerade
You watch bodies rot in
Your seas of laughter and hate
We don't give a damn about your thought-parade
Another thing you did forget
We're not like you; we're not for sale
Oh, coming for you, pain, take in

Feeding off lies and hatred
Why did we put up with these games?
Now we are bigger than you're ever going to be
Now I watch you fall, so down into the ground
Your time is done, coming for you, pain, take in

Thrust
Thrust
Thrust
Thrust
