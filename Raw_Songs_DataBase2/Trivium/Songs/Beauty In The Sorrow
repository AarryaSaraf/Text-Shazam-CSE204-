Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

It felt so strange
Living in my grave
Count each breath, waiting to expire

Remember home
Dying here alone
Hollow words, anthems from the choir

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all
The beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

It felt so strange
Looking at your grave
An early end, I read letters to remember

So I moved on
Or so the story goes
Shots rang out, red flowers a reminder

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all
The beauty in the sorrow
