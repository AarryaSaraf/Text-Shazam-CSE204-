I fear I'll die a forgotten man
Just a number, a grain of sand

Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I can take

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

I hope to die with no regrets
To leave a mark no one forgets

Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I can take

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

Bearing down, bearing down on me
The weight of all my insecurities

Closing in, closing in on me
The walls collapse, I'll never be set free

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone
