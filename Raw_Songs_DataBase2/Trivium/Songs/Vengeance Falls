I am outnumbered
My vision blurred
I'm absorbed by rage
The outcome turns
Bit the hand
Greater man
When you wrought my wrath
Your end began
You broke me down
A shattered crown
I shoveled deep
And tried to drown

This attack
Turned life black
So I built this flame
To burn you back

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls

I have climbed through dirt
Through mud and earth
In this quest for life
I've only hurt
I lost myself
And none could help
Felt unending pain
Perpetual hell
Death arrived
Smile contrived
He pulled me close
But I survived

This attack
Turned life black
Now I own this flame
And burn you back

(And burn you back)

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From out the pyre
A new life calls

If they build it higher
We will storm their walls
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls

Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 
Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 
Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 
Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 
Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 
Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) 


[Solo]

Gathered the strength just to hold it close
Took in the spark that became my pulse
Waited so long just to make you feel
My vengeance now has become so real

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From out the pyre
A new life calls

If they build it higher
We will storm their walls
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls
