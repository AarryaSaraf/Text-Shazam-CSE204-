As I descend, I see the end
It's reaching up to pull me in
The bowels of Hell, a prison cell
It's decorated with my sin

I smash the shackles
God above me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you find yourself in time

As I ascend, need not defend
My reasons that I must avenge
A dying dream, unspoken being
I clean myself of you, I'm free

I smash the shackles
God above me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you'll find yourself in time

Revelation
Liberation
Revelation

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you find yourself in time
