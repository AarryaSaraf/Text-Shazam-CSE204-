Album: WhatTheDeadMenSay

// What The Dead Men Say //

I'm calling out to you, can you hear me?
Numb and disconnected, just beyond your sight
I'm not myself anymore
But I'm not alone

I'm not alone
I'm not alone

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

I'm holding onto you, do you feel me?
Trapped but unaffected, like a memory
I'm waiting for a sign of life
And I can't let go

I can't let go
I can't let go

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

Is this the light or a distant mirror
You've kept me for yourself, that much is clear

What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

What the dead men say
What the dead men say
You can't let go
What the dead men say
It's just between us
What the dead men say
You can't let go

// Catastrophist //

Who has the means to save us from ourselves
To pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again
Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Bought and sold before we could even breathe

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance

How far along before we fade away
So deeply out of focus but it seems we never cared
Deflect, deny what flows inside
The poison springs internalize
Bought and sold before we could even breathe

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance

Never had a chance

Who has the means to save us from ourselves
To pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again, feeding back again

The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist

Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Deflect, deny, what flows inside
The poison springs internalize

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
We never had a chance
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance

Catastrophist

The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist

// Amongst The Shadows & The Stones //

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

Dying mother forced to reconcile
A hellish landscape just to feed her child
Our interest waning, we desensitize
Abusive power now becomes enshrined

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

Shining skies will bring on death below
A compromising choice now rings hollow
Self-interest gaining, killing monetized
A million lives to boost the bottom line

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones

My fear is teething
Through salt and sweat
The air decreasing
Burns with regret

My fear is teething
Through salt and sweat
The air decreasing
Burns with regret

Crumbled cities scattered far and wide
The myth of mercy buried deep inside

The harder we fight, the faster we fall
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl
The joke in the end that no one will know
We're dying for nothing at all

The harder we fight, the faster we fall (fall)
Stabbed in the back, defeated we crawl (crawl)
The joke in the end that no one will know (know)
We're dying for nothing at all

Bloodied corpses, broken bones reveal
A throng of clashes crushed, our nightmare sealed
Amongst the shadows and the stones
Amongst the shadows and the stones
Amongst the shadows and the stones

// Bleed Into Me //

Bleed into me
An ounce of your empathy
Eyes lock, you can see
A ghost, an invisible city

Bleed into me
Those feelings you're harboring
The silence says it all
Tragedy, the look before the fall

Struggles and dreams mix into one
The grim rituals have only begun
No use in leaving
I'll drift off before you are gone
Before you are gone

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

Let it bleed into you
(Bleed into you)

Bleed into me
A bit of your apathy
Cast aside, forget me
Another disappears in the city
(Another disappears in the city)

Struggles and dreams mix into one
The grim rituals have only begun
No use in leaving
I'll drift off before you are gone
Before you are gone

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

Let it bleed into you

Falling down
Falling down
An ounce of your empathy
Struggles and dreams
They'll drift off before you are gone
(Gone! Gone! Gone!)
(Gone! Gone! Gone!)

(Before you are gone)

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
(Tell them the truth)
As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

As it bleeds into me
Let it sink in for you
Tell them the story
Tell them the truth

Let it bleed into you
(Bleed into you)
(Bleed into you)

// The Defiant //

Explicit deviance
Don't have to hide
Display their wealth of sin
Right 'fore our eyes

Complicit in ruin
Protect with lies
Defenestrate, destroy
Mock and victimize

Nothing to gain
Playing their games
Always the same
Corruption betrays

I stand in defiance of your ways
(The defiant, the defiant)
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
(The defiant, the defiant in your way)

// Sickness Unto You //

I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you

I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you

I felt your heart stop beating
With my own two hands
I felt my life lose meaning
I'll never be whole again

I held you in my arms
As she injected you with death
We made you feel like there was nothing wrong

It won't stop replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth of my beloved
Who now is dead

I felt your heart stop beating
With my own two hands
I felt my life lose meaning
I'll never be whole again

I watched you start to fall
So I eased you to the ground
You looked both panicked and at peace

It won't stop replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth of my beloved
Who now is dead

I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you

My sickness unto you

(A part of me is fucking dead
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again)

A part of me is fucking dead
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again

A part of me is fucking dead
My lungs have filled up with regret
For every day I was away
I'll never be whole again

It won't stop replaying in my head
The opened eyes and mouth of my beloved
Who now is dead

I, I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
I give in
I am through
My sickness unto you
My sickness unto you
My sickness unto you

// Scattering The Ashes //

Your face betrays your words
And those words gave way to hurt
The ground between us grows
Like wounds that never show

But the distance couldn't mend
Cause the time ran out instead
The ground between us grows
Like wounds that never show

Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone

So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes

Your face reveals your pain
Seconds lost, I take the blame
The cold light cuts the night
Your ashes come to life

What's left is in my hands
Will I ever understand
The cold light cuts the night
Your ashes come to life

Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone

So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes

What's lost
We'll never know
What's lost
We'll never know

Of father and son
Two lives now come undone
Of father and son
Too late, now all is gone

So tonight
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes
I'm scattering the ashes

// Bending The Arc To Fear //

A strain of vigilance
Deep roots that all connect
We wait so diligent
Watching you
Watching you

(Watching you)
(Watching you)

An engine of suspicion
A web you can't escape
Crossing all lines to listen
Breaking through
Breaking through

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

This heart will prove
Bending the arc to fear

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

(Bending the arc to fear)

Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

This heart will prove
Bending the arc to fear
Bending the arc to fear

// The Ones We Leave Behind //

If you could breakdown and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same
If you could see all the ways we're tied together
Would you pull apart the ugliness and shame

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than anyone of us

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind

If we could break through the structures built between us
Then would all the fault lines simply disappear
If we could fight back (fight back!) and bring ourselves together
Then our sacrifices will not be in vain (will not be in vain!)

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than anyone of us

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind

If you could breakdown (down!) and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(Gods walk amongst all)
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind
