// In The Court Of The Dragon //

In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
In the court of the dragon
You will know your worth

Hammer clenched
Open mouth
Living 'neath the tides of pain
Surely any man would drown
Horrid king
Cries unheard
Bathed in blood
You'll get what you deserved

Burning home
Only child
Hidden from the deadly ones
Hunted far but never found
Nightmare past
Haunting him
Bides his time
Sinks into the sea

In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
In the court of the dragon
You will know your worth

Final clash
Beast and man
Rising from the violent waves
With the bloodied head in hand
Open mouth
Swallowing the king
Gods devoured whole
Light extinguishing

No more
Will the sun look down to illuminate the world?

In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend

The stars have died
And the heavens go up in flames
Earth
Sinks
The stars have died
And the heavens go up in flames
Earth
Sinks
The stars have died
And the heavens go up in flames

Earth
Sinks
The stars have died
And the heavens go up in flames

In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend
In spite of all the hate behind these eyes
I've seen that only one of us survives
I'm here to destroy you, I'm here to avenge
In the court of the dragon, I descend

In the court of the dragon
Death of gods and world
In the court of the dragon
You will know your worth

// Like A Sword Over Damocles //

Dark winter
Necrotic
Seems this will never end
Transgressions
My burdens are forever

Denial
Holding on
It's grip, it chokes the life
Of what was and will be
The Eternal present

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne
Who of you will dare

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

Declension
This poison
The power killing me
Detachment
Who am I?
What have I done?

The violence
Full of hate
The habit of our sins
Atonement buried in an unmarked grave

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne
Who of you will dare

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

Is it all you hoped for
Is it all that you dreamed
Is it all you hoped for
Feel the weight being king

Is it all you hoped for
Feel the weight being king

Who of you will dare to sit in the throne
Who of you will dare

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

You keep hanging this over me
Like a sword over Damocles
My life held by a thread and it's starting to sway
Like a sword over Damocles

// Feast Of Fire //

Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead

Compulsiveness for self destruction
Impulse led by entropy

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

Sunlight falters
As we wait the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves

Compulsiveness for self destruction
Impulse led by entropy

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing

Churning through the miseries
I find a tear unshed
This emptiness inside of me
It brings me out for dead

Sunlight falters
As we wait the world goes up in flames
I know we will be the ones
To fill up all these graves

I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down, keep sinking down
I'm crawling
Crawling through the feast of fire
Burning
Sinking down until these feelings begin to blur

It was all a blur and then it was nothing
It was all a blur and then it was nothing

Nothing

// A Crisis Of Revelation //

Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead

Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Old ones now emerge
Evil beyond comprehension
Bringing forth the ending of all man

Captive in their stare
Deafening, their voices heard
Anomie, broken by their words

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall

Waiting for all of it to fall
Waiting for all of it to fall

Banished immortal
Deformed out of recognition
Everything believed in was dead

Floundered in the void
Suffering the constant scourge
Cursed to walk alone amongst the stars

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

A crisis of revelation
A dawn without a sun

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

Time will betray (Take me)
Under skies that we age (Betray me)
I lie and wait for them to open the gates
Take me

// The Shadow Of The Abattoir //

Snow covers every path
Stumbling, no turning back
Pushing further till I fall
Looking up, I hear him call

What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way

No cover from the sun
Crumbling, fall one by one
Look in envy at the dead
They took pity as they said

What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way

Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

Black waters in our wake
Sinking, await our fate
Our dead future has arrived
Dark refrain, we can't deny

What's known is now lost forever
Endless shadows lead the way

Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky

From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky

From the depths
I will rise
From the ground to the sky

From the depths
I will rise
From the depths
I will rise

Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

Don't go searching for the battle
You won't find any beasts to slay
You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

Snow covers every path
Stumbling, no turning back

You'll rip yourself to pieces
You'll drive yourself insane
In the shadow of the abattoir

// No Way Back Just Through //

I am the blight, I am the emptiness
I am the night that comes for you
You can't escape 'cause I am everywhere
My immanence surrounding you

(Going nowhere) You're falling further
(Falling further) You're falling further down
(Going nowhere) You're falling further
(Falling further) You're falling further down

(Divine permeation of everything you are)
(There's no way back, no way back, just through)

There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through
There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through

I am the curse, I am the ambience
The sacred sounds that call for you
There is no peace, this is a reckoning
Your ignorance destroying you

(Going nowhere) You're falling further
(Falling further) You're falling further down
(Going nowhere) You're falling further
(Falling further) You're falling further down

(Divine permeation of everything you are)
(There's no way back, no way back, just through)

There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through
There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through

I will not live to see the final justice
But I'll be the one that comes for you

I am the blight, I am the emptiness
I am the night that comes for you
You can't escape 'cause I am everywhere
My immanence surrounding you

There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through
There's no way back, no way back
No way back, just through (No way back, just through)

No way back, just through
No way back

// Fall Into Your Hands //

Destined to burn
Those words carved into their heads
Fearful they won't say his name, they gaze
Off afar, in mute dismay
Nothing left sacred

We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers

We must admit
Our punishment is deserved
Callous to those that surround us all
Reaping in service of self
Fruit from a dying womb

We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers
We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers

So we fall (Fall!)
Fall into your hands
So we fall (Fall!)
Fall into your hands

So we fall
Fall into your hands
Fall (Fall!)
Fall into your hands

Go!

Sanctioned to serve
Brought to your knees
Lost inside my head
Freedom to bleed

Summoned from the depths (Summoned from the depths)
Crawl towards the sky
A fleeting light breaks through
The dark and bitter sky

Sanctioned to serve
Brought to your knees
Lost inside my head
Freedom to bleed

Summoned from the depths
Crawl towards the sky
A fleeting light breaks through
The dark and bitter sky

What if we were meant to fail?
What if we were meant to die?
What if we were meant to fail?
Running for our whole lives

Destined to burn
Those words carved into their heads
Fearful they won't say his name, they gaze
Off afar, in mute dismay
Nothing left sacred

We are the ones who burn it all to the ground
As we say our prayers

So we fall (Fall!)
Fall into your hands
So we fall (Fall!)
Fall into your hands

So we fall
Fall into your hands
Fall
Fall into your hands
Fall

// From Dawn To Decadence //

Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations

Run away
So far away
I can't outrun what is coming for me

My temptations
Woken from a dream, deviations

It's all the hate
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

Exaltation
Golden memories, my creation
Devastation
Pain is clarity, lamentations

Run away
So far away
I can't outrun what is coming for me

Divination
Foretold prophecies, annihilation

It's all the hate
That my heart beats
Negates my sympathies

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes

Decay
Embrace
Serpent's coil of all our mistakes

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

It's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine with all we love, it's like all we need
And all we want
Just withers on the vine from dawn to decadence

// The Phalanx //

Within the thrill, amidst the kill
One against all, soon blood will spill
We cannot wait to make your pain
We are the burn inside your brain

Herding the weak to fire
Scorching the fleeing liars
Witness the dying saboteurs
Carcasses washed upon the shores

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

Burn the bridge
Take the ash
Scatter deceptiveness

We are the ones who led the way
This path to hell and misery
An endless war, a hollow cause
When we all die, we'll see no gods

Herding the weak to fire
Scorching the fleeing liars
Witness the dying saboteurs
Carcasses washed upon the shores

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

Burn the bridge
Take the ash
Scatter deceptiveness

I'm the source
Of your hate
Only yourself to blame

Dying
Dying once seemed so heroic to me
Giving this body for a people in need
Now I realize there is nothing to see
Nothing but dirt and decay

Decay
Decay

Dying
Dying once seemed so heroic to me
Giving this body for a people in need
Now I realize there is nothing to see
Nothing but dirt and decay

Decay
Decay

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

If they should take me
Then may they break me
Kill me, burn me
But I'll stay torched into the heart

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

Don't let this take me
Split me wide open
Rip me from the stars

If they should take me
Then may they break me
Kill me, burn me
But I'll stay torched into the heart
