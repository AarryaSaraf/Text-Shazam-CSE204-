Album: Ascendancy

// Blinding Tears Will Break The Skies //

One by one they fall
To ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists
To ensure victory

This life is a battle
We will fight to ensure (to ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own

They'll try to take (try to take)
What's really ours (really ours)
They'll never take (never take)
What's in our hearts

The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies

One by one they fall
To ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists
To ensure victory

This life is a battle
We must fight to ensure (to ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own

They'll try to take (try to take)
What's really ours (really ours)
They'll never take (never take)
What's in our hearts

The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with these skies

This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn

This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn

They'll try to take (try to take)
What's really ours (really ours)
They'll never take (never take)
What's in our hearts

The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
The silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies

// The Deceived //

Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved

Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame (that force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)

To wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed

Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved

Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame (that force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (lost in the foreseen)

To wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed

Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god

Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god

To wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
To wait for aforementioned dreams time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed

// Rain //

Every time I'm left alone
My misery begins to drown me
Tied by a rope of anxiety
Thrown overboard

As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
I refuse to see

[Chorus]
Time will always be the thing that kills me truly
Open these eyes waking from a dream feigning

My lungs fill up with letdown
Disappointment in self and everyone
Expectations died in failure
abandonment my unsavior

As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
I refuse to see

[Chorus]

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Choke
Die choking on your every word

Swallow every blasphemy

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do

Swallow every blasphemy
Eat out your heart and make it bleed
Tie the noose around my neck
Make this life end

// Pull Harder On The Strings Of Your Martyr //

The face and the lips tremble as it rips
Your breath quickening as heat rushes in

Pull harder strings martyr
Stop you cry that's a lie
Flush gasping white reddening
You smile and destroy it - it's time that we end this

It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings

Clawing the skin each kill your weakness
Annihilation your masturbation- tyrant, I'll burn you down

PULL, HARDER, STRINGS, MARTYR
STOP, you CRY, that's, a LIE!
FLUSH, GASPING, WHITE, REDDENING!
You SMILE, and destroy it - it's time that we end this!

It's our curse, that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing, our, king to spread his genocidal wings!

It's our curse, that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing, our, king to spread his genocidal wings!

My hands grip your throat I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart - I avenge
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay You ask me oh God why
'Cause I'm God that's fucking why

For every life you have taken
I am here to repay

PULL, HARDER, STRINGS, MARTYR
STOP, you CRY, that's, a LIE!
FLUSH, GASPING, WHITE, REDDENING!
You SMILE, and destroy it - it's time that we end this!

It's our curse, that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings!

It's our curse, that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings!

// Drowned And Torn Asunder //

Force-feed them your ways
Dictate up a blinded swarm
Society's afraid

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold

[Chorus:]
Our enemy will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder

Take all your lives back
Arson all they create
The time is now to lead the battle

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold

[Chorus]

Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold

[Chorus x2]

// Ascendancy //

All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew

All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

Go

I spread the fuel with ire
Desire
To incinerate all - Behold I rise - phoenix
Phoenix

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be
Was supposed to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

// A Gunshsot To The Head Of Trepidation //

You starve your children on neglect
Then feed their bellies with fear
Concussion bat to the brain
Witness to a battered mother

[Chorus]
Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
A gunshot to head of trepidation
My promise if you ever lay a finger

Just look at the scars you make
Your terror makes your kids break
A broken home just as you were raised
With fist raised up to your children

[Chorus]

This battle is on all
You've made beautiful
Now hateful
You wretched life wrecker
Abuser
Now suffer

Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife we'll strike down the hand
(Open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
(Open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive x2

// Like Light To The Flies //

Behold our beloved revels
In tragedy (in tragedy)
Self-denying avarice for bloodshed
Behold hypocrite

Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned

Devoutly wished for blinded eyes
This tragedy's like light to the flies
This seems to suit you better
Bleeding out the eyes
Hope's left in chain suspension
Holding onto lies, to make the truth

// Dying In Your Arms //

I'm wearing thin wearing out becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope she's my self-destructive
Bleeding disease the things that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again asphyxiated

[Chorus]
And now I see it's you that's tearing me ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms I cut you out now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped cut this noose around my
Neck I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You're dead to me

[Chorus x2]

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

[Chorus x2]

// Suffocating Sight //

I am but a farce, a satire of stability 
Insecurity is an uphill struggle 
It's me versus the world 

The shore still starves for another 
Novel of my shipwrecked being 
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing 
The sands of time, for me, are running out 

My hands shake in apprehension 
Of every action 
I'm guilty of 
playing the victim 

The shore still starves for another 
Novel of my shipwrecked being 
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing 
The sands of time, for me, are running out 

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you
[x2]

It's time for your panic
Then it kills
Makes you manic

Making its way inside
Relax it's all right
Making its way inside
Relax it's all right

Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
[x4]

// Departure //

This weight is so unbearable caving my lungs
All my life seems to be flashing in front of my eyes (in front of my eyes)
Run away from all the pain, All The Pain In life

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!

Ways of devotion turn to obsession open your eyes (open Your Eyes)
I want you to see what you've done to me
crying out those eyes (crying out those eyes)
Run away from all the pain, all the pain in life

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!
Bring my end! (bring My End!) to an end!

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me
Razors kiss the vein overdose for pain
A 12 gauge cross kisses the forehead a savior in a shell
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, Fuck the world, Fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown

Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, Fuck the world, Fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!
Bring my end! (bring My End!) to an end!
Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me

// Declaration //

Freedom is all I have to say in defense
Of what the world's becoming
A nation hell bent on choosing what's right
And how we all should live our lives
Fuck their ways it is time to break free
Fuck their hate acceptance is what we need
Equality for every race, sex, sexuality
And every choice to live our lives
And to you bigot cretin ignoramus
Mind your own goddamn fucking business
Holding onto what makes us whole
Never letting their poison take control
Freezing the air (that stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (bear witness to me)
Feeling the Fear (that stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (bear witness to me)
I'll be right here
Falling away
Fighting on principle
I'll die 1000 times
Before I'll ever be them
Burn the scriptures
bury the governing
Free yourself
Break the structures
Declare Freedom

// Washing Away Me In The Tides //

Disgusted with what I see
So many pieces left of you and me
Glass falls like rain
I'll crucify you for this pain (for this pain)

Tonight I leave this town
In love I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) you're nothing to me
(To the ground) you're fucking killing me
Abandon all hope washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made round my neck accepting the end

Longing to see your face
So my hand can form into a mace
Everything smells of you
Even the gasoline that covers you

[The version of the song from "Ascendancy (Special Edition)" (2006) and "Underworld: Evolution" original soundtrack (2006) ends here. But the version from original "Ascendancy" album continues further.]

Tonight I leave this town
In love I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) you're nothing to me
(To the ground) you're fucking killing me
Abandon all hope washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made round my neck accepting the end

[Guitar Interlude, Solo]

Everything smells of you
Even the gasoline that covers you

Tonight I leave this town
In love I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) you're nothing to me
(To the ground) you're fucking killing me
Abandon all hope washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made round my neck accepting the end

Abandon all hope washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made round my neck accepting the end
