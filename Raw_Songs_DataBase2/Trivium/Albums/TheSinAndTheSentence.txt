Album: TheSinAndTheSentence

// The Sin And The Sentence //

I heard the passing bells calling out my name
I knew I'd never see another day
I couldn't swim against the tides of blame
I knew there was no other way

You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

I saw the dagger eyes staring back at me
I knew I'd never have a chance to plead
Guilty, but in the sight of fallen men
They bury you before you speak
(The sin and the sentence)

You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me

They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me

Fuck!

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat

// Beyond Oblivion //

These graves are cold and empty
He knew it's where we'd soon reside
The waves recede so gently
They only left the sands of time

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

These shadows sleep so soundly
Appalled, he now averts his eyes
Disgraced, he felt so empty
Entrusting us with our demise

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

// Other Worlds //

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other

Is there hope
To break through
All the walls
Built around you

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Dim the world
A glassy stare
Face to face now

Do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Broken mast
Shipwrecked mind
Future sinks
By design

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Lost our minds
Lost our way
Face to face now

Do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
We lost our way in the other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

// The Heart From Your Hate //

What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate

It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat
It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
Dig below the surface, find your insecurities

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate

You always walk away
Soon you'll have to face it
Your distance from reality won't bury or erase it
I tried to do the same
Living so complacent
But the problems wouldn't go away so I turned around to face them

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)

Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate

// Betrayer //

Betrayer
Betrayer

I say betrayer
I swear I've given you so much
Naysayer
I watched as you just lapped it up
Unwilling
Addicted to be without dignity
A cheater
You thrive on lechery

I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)

Betrayer
Betrayer

You're calculating
I know you know exactly what you're doing
Your selfishness your only cause

A fake, a farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

What do you want from me
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend
I say betrayer

A fake, a farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

What do you want from me
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer

// The Wretchedness Inside //

Submerged in dirt but it was never enough
To quell the fire in the back of my lungs
My bones are aching and my head is a mess
They said to run but I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

Consigned to hurt but it was never enough
To bury feelings that will surely return
My heart is aching, and my god I'm a mess
I'll never run cause I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

I cannot control I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide

The wretchedness inside of you
(In hell, can I confide)
The wretchedness inside of me

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

Fuck you

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

I cannot control I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide

The wretchedness inside of you
(In hell, can I confide)
The wretchedness inside of me

// Endless Night //

Is it a sin
To miss the hell
That you survived
With best of friends
At worst of times
I never got the answer

They never told me
If you're not careful
What doesn't kill you
Can control you
Now it defines me
And it reminds me
That it will never let me go

If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

When it gets dark
I can not breathe
It's only the sound
Of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
And it's lurking violence

Your empty words
The feigned concern
We go through the motions
I never return
Cause it still defines me
And it reminds me
That it will never let me go

If we share the pain
Then maybe we won't have to bury memories away

I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

Is it a sin
To miss the hell
That you survived
With best of friends
At worst of times
I fight another endless night

I try to change
But the dawn escapes again
I fight another endless night

When it gets dark
I can not breathe
It's only the sound
Of grinding teeth
Afraid of the silence
I fight another endless night

// Sever The Hand //

Liturgies and prophecies
They mean nothing to me
I believe in substance
Not the patterns that you see

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Straws you grip so tightly
Now becoming your own noose
Story collapsing, ask yourself
Can you hang from your own truth

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again, free yourself again

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
(Of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again, free yourself again

Mindlessly crawling
You're choked by a leash
Seeking redemption
You practice and preach

Cognitive failure
Your sickness reveals
The horror and panic
Exposing what's real

Life burns me alive
Life burns me alive

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
Sever the hand
To free yourself again, free yourself again

Sever the hand
Of any god or man
(Of any god or man)
Sever the hand
To free yourself again, free yourself again

// Beauty In The Sorrow //

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

It felt so strange
Living in my grave
Count each breath, waiting to expire

Remember home
Dying here alone
Hollow words, anthems from the choir

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all
The beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

It felt so strange
Looking at your grave
An early end, I read letters to remember

So I moved on
Or so the story goes
Shots rang out, red flowers a reminder

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

The beauty in the sorrow

So young
Did it even matter
So young
Did it even matter

Can we make sense of it all
The lies our fathers told
To find the beauty in the sorrow

The lies they told
Can we make sense of it all
The beauty in the sorrow

// The Revanchist //

I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The color of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been calling you from the twilight
I've been pushing you to the edge

The way you say my name
The poison on your tongue
The lies they tell - pay no mind
I am the only one
You never turned you back
You didn't need to see
Cause even in the dead of night
You found your way to me

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

I've been waiting here on the outside
I've been watching you from afar

The color of your fear
Confusion deep inside
Resentment boils over
In me you can confide
You say you've lost your world
You say you've lost your faith
I'll be the shelter in the dark
Clothe you in my hate

Profiteers and preachers
Sycophants and leachers

The Revanchist - his thoughts become mine
How deep they become intertwined
He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

He said
Submit for salvation
Submit for salvation
The age old lie

Submit for salvation

// Thrown Into The Fire //

Forgive them, father
For they not know
My gospel of greed
Is all for show

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth

And the congregation weeps

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth

And the congregation weeps

Will you bless us
With your mysterious ways
Will you grace us
With your mysterious ways
Will you heal us
With your mysterious ways
Will you save us
With your mysterious ways

Forgive me, father
Lust knows no bounds
I service my needs
On hallowed grounds

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth

And the congregation weeps

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth

And the congregation weeps

Will you bless us
With your mysterious ways
Will you grace us
With your mysterious ways
Will you heal us
With your mysterious ways
Will you save us
With your mysterious ways

Will you bless us
With your mysterious ways
Will you grace us
With your mysterious ways
Will you heal us
With your mysterious ways
Will you save us
With your mysterious ways
