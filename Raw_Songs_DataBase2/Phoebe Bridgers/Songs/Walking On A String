The things you said are hanging in the middle of my mind tonight
I can't turn 'em off
I try to worry for your soul but I forget to
All the time
I'm in a twisted web and I can't pull my
Head from it

I think about you walking on a string
It always bring me back here
Into the garden by the hand
You've always had me
Walking on a string

I knew that I was dead before you touched my lonesome skin
You're never running out of ways to worm your way back in
I hang my head and feel the oxygen drain
I think about you walking on a string and it always brings me back here

Into the garden by the hand
Anyone who knows what love is will understand
You've always had me
Walking on a string

In a web, I can't escape it
You'll always worm your way back in
To my lonesome soul and take it
You've always had me walking on a string

In a web, I can't escape it
You'll always worm your way back in
To my lonesome soul and take it
You've always had me walking on a string
