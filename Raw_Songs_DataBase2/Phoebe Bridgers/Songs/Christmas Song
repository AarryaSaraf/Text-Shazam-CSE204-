Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it
