I had nothing to say on Christmas Day
When you threw all your clothes in the snow
When you burnt your hair and knocked over chairs
I just tried to stay out of your way

But when you fell asleep
With blood on your teeth
I just got in my car and drove away

Listen to me, Butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

Where the state highway starts, I parked my car
And I got out and stared up at the stars
And as meteors dived and shot across the sky
I thought about your sad, shining eyes

I came back for my clothes
When the sun finally rose
When you were still passed out on the floor

Listen to me, Butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass
