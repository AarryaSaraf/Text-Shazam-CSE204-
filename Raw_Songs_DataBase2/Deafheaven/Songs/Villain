A cold floor fit for you
In all your midnight itching
No one coming quickly to
Save you from the After
Hurried with the hounds now

He's my own
Eclipsing my love
His rottweiler sermon
He's my own
Driving the talons
My own villain rising

30 months, I'm still asking
If 30 months feels strong
30 months I'm seeking
A 30 months' fortune
Inform my mother's people
30 months is war
Dealing with the blood of
30 years well worn

He's my own
Eclipsing my love
His rottweiler sermon
He's my own
Driving the talons
My own villain rising

You're not alarmed by this heady division?
You're not alarmed by this heady division?
My own villain rising
My own villain rising, my only villain rising
