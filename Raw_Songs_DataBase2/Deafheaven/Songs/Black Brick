Imagining curving letters in a languid psalm
In abstract time, full levity rolling through
Intangible phantom mystery
And
The furnace of gentle dreams
A caustic womb
Champagne light
After the sacred deep blue majesty of dawn
Naked and cordial and virgin
Patience and poise
Twin ribbons bare
And make vivid
A dark shallow vein
Disguise and shame
Of all light downward
A gaunt fashion
Pulled tightly over peaking bone
A small scene from in the smoking censer
A heart, the pulse of rotten roots
Twining through soil
Feasting on droplets
Rest come again
Rest crack puzzled, so urgent
Wild
Violent
Freedom flutters down the drain again
One eye wide to the braille
Of fireflies
I tunnel
Brutishly
Pig headed
And full of steam
Into the damp comfort
Of this lonely trench
