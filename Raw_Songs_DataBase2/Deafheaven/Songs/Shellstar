Nothing changes the condition
Dormant sooted desertion
When a violet peeling shows teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
A sublime wander through summer fire
The char, the ash, the cough, the roar

I question the reason
For the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason
In this furnace of revealing

Salvage the illusion of once mint gardens
Before a violet peeling showed teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
When it takes you, you'll be remembered
Young and kind for all time

I question the reason
For the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason
In this furnace of revealing

All my reasons gone

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping
