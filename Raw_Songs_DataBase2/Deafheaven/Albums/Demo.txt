Album: Demo

// Libertine Dissolves //

I married into the fly trap
I sunk into suburban sand
Victimized by restlessness
Blacking out in the lion's mouth.
I laughed at the cigarette stain;
inhaling black on the blinds
And cried at the digital bulb blasts on the frames of my memory
I am transparent.
Denied, segregate from the obvious.
Drunk and despairing--sick.
"I loved a girl I'll never speak to again. I spoke to a girl I never stopped loving".

I am transparent, denied, segregate from the obvious

// Daedalus //

Conjugate the spilled verbs; which is best for regret?
Which allows your heavy eyes to sleep?
Where has God gone wrong?
Shake the hand of your deepest fear.
Was it not your hero who saw when you wept?
Could you call if you began to weep?
Where has God gone wrong?
Her glassy eyes still feel the warmth
so carry on to seas of bliss
and heal your heart with those you miss.
Weighed down by stone doves.
Hand in hand through dooms of love.

// Exit: Denied //

Choked whines filter through the crack in the window
where the sun fell through moments ago.
And in this hour, the seas blows in the cataracts of his final day.
His blessed concussed confusion.
His seizing airways.
He holds his head wishing for his mother.
He takes to the cold.
Where has the child gone?
I thought he was anchored to his texts?
His revered studies?
He grew tired of the distant solar systems
and stopped counting his nightly collection of clouds.
He smudged the blood of his lover.
"We are never apart. Maybe in distance, but never in heart."
