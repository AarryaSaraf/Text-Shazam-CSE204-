Album: InfiniteGranite

// Shellstar //

Nothing changes the condition
Dormant sooted desertion
When a violet peeling shows teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
A sublime wander through summer fire
The char, the ash, the cough, the roar

I question the reason
For the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason
In this furnace of revealing

Salvage the illusion of once mint gardens
Before a violet peeling showed teeth glowing
Horizons fleeing, lilacs swaying
When it takes you, you'll be remembered
Young and kind for all time

I question the reason
For the freedom in unfeeling
I question the reason
In this furnace of revealing

All my reasons gone

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

Flooded with raining
Levees are breaking
Houses are bursting
Sisters are sleeping

// In Blur //

In blur, father
Glanced over stirred
Imagined you laughing
Muddied feet dancing
What is this aching prism?
This prison wincing
Receiving sudden swaths of dogma

Wandering over royal yonder
Wandering over flooded ground again

What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look like?
Solitude and falling into respites now

In blur, hovered
Accepted devotion
Unearther, bleeding ark of creation

Wandering over royal yonder
Wandering over flooded ground again

What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look like?
Solitude and falling into respites now

What does daylight look like in this chaos of cold?
What does daylight look like?
Solitude and falling into respites now

Who are you now?

Forgive the trembling love
I'm weak and acting bold
Forgive the trembling love
I'm weak and acting bold
And alone
And alone
And alone
And alone

// Great Mass Of Color //

Quiet as a cradle
I laid in a middle night drift, spinning
Hissed at the moon
Conjured up the flowers
To fix my impression of the gloom

I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
I feel them all
The great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
Dissolving into red

Half awake holding my ghost in the morning
Sunlight coming down the bend
Maroon sky on the send
My great former terror
When trees gave doves the leaves
And I was grim drunk death
A stranger to myself

I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooding in my bed
I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooding in my bed
Dissolving into red

Can I accept I'm real?

Do I need this affection?
Do you?
Do you need this confusion?
Do you?
Living trapped inside this body
Soft, haunted, waiting, wanting
Measured change evades real healing
Taking love with little reason

Seeing you as I was: behind a locked door
Nervous and a fool
Seeing you as I was: desperate for men to guide you

You are the sea and nobody owns you
Owns you
You are the sea and nobody owns you
Owns you
Owns you, owns you, owns you, owns you

// Lament For Wasps //

Frigid bedroom capture
In a spring without desire
Harvesting brightness despite
Drawn to the heat, not the light

I lay steady
Stare at the ceiling
Waking fears of nothing
You lament for wasps
You glow cobalt
In the home of the friendless

Another night spent fussing
Feasting like the lords
Laughing at the fronting
Singing to the chords of Hell imagined
To the chords of Hell imagined
Hell imagined
Hell imagined

In this perfect hour
Gasping in a sleepless kneel
Holding onto gleaming teal

I lay steady
Stare at the ceiling
Waking fears of nothing
You lament for wasps
You glow cobalt
In the home of the friendless

Another night spent fussing
Feasting like the lords
Laughing at the fronting
Singing to the chords of Hell imagined
To the chords of Hell imagined
Hell imagined
Hell imagined

Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue

Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue
Lament for wasps
Cobalt blue

// Villain //

A cold floor fit for you
In all your midnight itching
No one coming quickly to
Save you from the After
Hurried with the hounds now

He's my own
Eclipsing my love
His rottweiler sermon
He's my own
Driving the talons
My own villain rising

30 months, I'm still asking
If 30 months feels strong
30 months I'm seeking
A 30 months' fortune
Inform my mother's people
30 months is war
Dealing with the blood of
30 years well worn

He's my own
Eclipsing my love
His rottweiler sermon
He's my own
Driving the talons
My own villain rising

You're not alarmed by this heady division?
You're not alarmed by this heady division?
My own villain rising
My own villain rising, my only villain rising

// The Gnashing //

Buried secrets, mythic meanings
In tender oceans spilling crimson
A leaking thimble flowing fragile
Oozing tension into blue

Hear these howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear these howls embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us
I know it's exhausting you

(Without you, I am hushed) A hush
(Without you, I am hushed) A hush
(Without you, I am hushed) Like cloaking garment
(Without you, I am hushed) Over shivers
(Without you, I am hushed) In this honeyed season
(Without you, I am hushed) Why are the boys bleeding?
(Without you, I am hushed) Have your tears touched
(Without you, I am hushed) Someone's eyes tonight?

Hear these howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear these howls embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us
I know it's exhausting you

Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason

// Other Language //

In dreams speaking
In other language
Held you closely
Fed on lightning

How could you see beacons shining in the shallow?
How could you know relief while sinking to
Mirages out of view?

Crawl and wander
Tears to water
Growing this garden alone

How could you see beacons shining in the shallow?
How could you know relief while sinking to
Mirages out of view?

Blues and golds
Jewels for Heaven knows, I know
I hear the sound
Imagine loving you
At funerals for the few

Navel gazing, birds escaping
Before the quake comes crashing
Navel gazing, birds escaping
Waiting in the light to die

Bound wet legs splayed for the heat wave
For the heat wave
Bound wet legs splayed for the heat wave
Waiting in the light to die

// Mombasa //

Stranded naked on the sandbar
Echoed from the stars
Neon
Sea snake cemetery roaming under dusk

Doberman visions
You're undressing
Mute and bleary

Hillside castles baking down to sand
Hillside castles baking down to sand

Shamed red Chopin
Plays awful sounds from the dresser
Nurse's hands carving in slate
Hummingbird gestures

Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom
Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom

The hospital bed filled with your apathy
In a haze of heat, a father hums his tragic song
Before the cold sees its ceremony
Oh, in your icy eyes
The daybreak glance given

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
