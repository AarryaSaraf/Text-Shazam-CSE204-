// Delivering The Goods //

Feeling like we're, ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, my bodies aching
Looking for some action, satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced, as active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton, Leviathan, we're ready to hit the roof

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Uhhh, Delivering the goods

Shake down, rock 'em boys, crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves, battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts all across the land
Hot blood doing good, we're going to load you with our brand

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Yeah, Delivering the goods

Have it your way
Stealing your hearts

Well we don't pull no punches, we aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You gotta learn your lesson
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart

Faster, higher
'Til it seems that we're gonna break
Ohh shootin' further, giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leaving your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Uhhh, Delivering the goods
Uhhh, Delivering the goods

// Rock Forever //

When the day is over
I like to ease my mind
By juicing up my system
With this beat of a heavy kind
I smack a bottle open
I crank the Hi-Fi high
I'm in a seventh heaven
Ooh, I can touch the sky

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about my rock forever

It starts to moving to me
Just that I can't explain
It's like a brilliant sunshine
After standing in the pouring rain
My skin begins to tingle
Ooh, right on down my back
It's really got me fevered
Pounding my senses flat

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about my rock forever

Rock, rock, rock forever
I love my
Rock, rock, rock forever
My fever
Rock, rock, rock forever
Always going to
Rock, rock, rock forever
I can't stop talking about rock
Now give them back, boys

So when you get those blue days
Here's just what to do
Switch into this lifeline
And feel it rushing through
Before you know it, blue days
Are better left behind
By juicing up your system
With this beat of a heavy kind

I'm in love, so in love
And I can't stop talking about the
Rock forever, rock forever
I'm going to rock forever

// Evening Star //

[Tipton/Halford]

I traveled to a distant shore
I felt I had to go
An inner voice had called me there
But why I did not know
I saw the evening star rise up
Shining out to sea
And now I understand at last what it means
What it all means

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

I used to tempt fate
I couldn't see straight
I faltered through my younger days
Never knowing where I was going
Then something helped me penetrate the haze

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

Now I am stronger
The haze no longer
Will veil my future destiny
Such inspirations and new sensations
Though nothing strange has changed in me

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

I'm home once more, much better for
The things that I have found
Much wiser now, so simple how
Each time I turn around
I see the evening star rise up
Shining out on me
And now I understand at last what it means
What it all means

Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright (guiding me)

[3x to Fade Out]
Evening star I can see the light
Evening star guiding me so bright

// Hell Bent For Leather //

[Tipton]

Seek him here, seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await, engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear

Wheels! A glint of steel and a flash of light!
Screams! From a streak of fire as he strikes!

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

Black as night, faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition, sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes

Fools! Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams! Crash one by one to the ground

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

There's many who tried to prove that they're faster
But they didn't last and they died as they tried

Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather
Hell bent, hell bent for leather

// Burnin' Up //

[Downing/Tipton]

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking

We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
'Cause we're burnin' up

You make me greedy, you won't feed me my food
But I'll make out easy, 'cause I see straight through you
You cool me off and hot me up and that's not right
'Cause you'll get hungry in the heat of the night

And then we'll make love, just when it's right
And when we make love tonight
We'll be burnin' up

I know you feel the same
I know you feel the flame
Staring deep inside of you
Burnin' you up, breaking ya down
Breakin' you out in a cold sweat
And as you lose control, of your very soul
Your desire takes over
You'll feel the heat sway
You're round to my way
And suddenly you'll know that you're burnin' up

You stitch me up good, and you cut me down
So I string you up to keep you hanging around
You dish the hot stuff up but you keep me waiting
So I'll play it dirty 'til your body is breaking

We've got to make love, the time is right
We've got to make love tonight
'Cause we're burnin' up
We're burnin' up

// The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown) //

[Peter Green]

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come creeping around, making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe that you need my love so bad
You come sneaking around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here, trying to keep from following you

// Killing Machine //

[Tipton]

I never give true answers, I never tell no lies
I never walk a straight line, so never get surprised
I don't ask no favors, so don't get abused
I learned to win when I was young
So I'm never ever gonna lose

They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract, on you

I never ask no questions, I never speak my mind
I always found that silence helps to keep me and my kind alive
I take care of business, It takes care of me
I look after myself and do it well
'cause somebody's always looking for me

They pay me the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you

What manner of man am I?
A gun, lump sum and then I move on
What manner of man are you?
Stab a friend's back to jump a queue

I do what I do 'cos I can't do nothing better
You do what you do, just defendin' yourself

'cos you got nothin' better to do

I got no face, no name, I'm just a killing machine
I cut the population down, if you know what I mean
I never stop in one place, I move about the cities
Got expensive tastes, but I hasten to add that
I'm the best that there is

They pay me-uh the money and I do the job
I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you

I got a contract on you
I got a contract on you

// Running Wild //

[Tipton]

I move as fast as I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a madman
My feet don't touch the ground
I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside
Cause when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild

Dead or alive there's nothing
That bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall
They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and I defy
Cause what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild

No chains can hold me down
I always break away
I never hear society
Tell me what to do or say
I taste the life that pleases me
And raise a storm for all the world to see I never stumble, never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but I walk tall
And I demand respect

I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Cause when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild

I'm running wild
I'm running wild
Get outta my way
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
You better believe it
Wild...

// Before The Dawn //

[Downing/Tipton/Halford]

Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"
Outside the birds begin to call
As if to summon up my leaving

It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
Oh please don't take it all away

It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long, and now you're leaving
Oh please don't take it all away

Before the dawn, I hear you whisper
In your sleep "Don't let the morning take him"

// Evil Fantasies //

[Tipton/Halford/Downing]

We turn and face each other
My fingers pull your hair
You wince and jerk my wrist off
I bite my lip and stare
Your stance at once defiant
I'm rigid to your pose
You clench your teeth in anger
My loving swells and grows

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

You're dragged into my vision
Trapped, subservient to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds
You slide your nails down in me
I raise my structure high
You pout, I snarl, you whimper
And wave compassion 'bye (ohhh)

You give me evil fantasies
I wanna get inside your mind
Come on and live my fantasies
I'll show you evil you can't hide

A, give me evil

Gonna take you, wanna get through
Gonna make you, do what I want

You're dragged into my vision

Trapped, subservient to my needs
Maybe imagination
Is where my dark side feeds

[fading refrain:]
C'mon, evil. Yeah! You give me evil, evil fantasies.
C'mon! You evil. Yeah! Gimme, gimme, gimme fantasies.
I want it, you got it, those evil fantasies.
Oh, you need it! I'm gonna give it!
Give it, give it, give it fantasy-ohhh!
C'mon and get it, get it! Fantasies...

// Fight For Your Life //

Get a grip on the action
I'm moving heaven and earth
Don't let go of the action
Push for all that you're worth

No denying
It goes against the grain
So Defying
You're screaming again

Fight for your life
Fight for your money
Fight for your life
Fight for your money

Time for steel, stop at nothing
Looking fate in the face
We don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race

Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
A hard resolution
That is true to the end

// Riding On The Wind (Live) //

Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowin god of Mars
Body burning bright

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind

Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind

Ridin' on the wind! Ridin' on the wind!
Ridin' on the wind! RIDING ON THE WIND!

Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screamin' demons yell
Bursting through the clouds

Well I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
Yes I'm ridin', ridin' on the wind
