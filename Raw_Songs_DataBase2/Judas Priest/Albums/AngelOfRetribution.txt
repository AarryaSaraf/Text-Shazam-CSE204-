Album: AngelOfRetribution

// Judas Rising //

White bolts of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm

War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm
Forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain forever undying

Judas is Rising

Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world

Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved

The burden of shame
Echos the prophecy
Ascending from Hell
Forever despising

Judas is Rising

Apprentice revealed
Deceivers are crying
My crucified steel
Evangelizing

Judas is Rising
Judas is Rising

// Deal With The Devil //

Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realise

Driving in that transit
Down to holy Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed

Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die

We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fuelled the fury solid to the bone

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

Rollin' down the m-way
Took it to the smoke
Bangin' heads there
'til we all went broke

When we don the leather, and the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed

Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades

Watched the movement grow
Into one voice
Took on all the world
It had no choice

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar

Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind

Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel

// Revolution //

If you think it's over
Better think again
There'll be no compromise
Turning up the power
Feel adrenaline
Move into overdrive

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

If you think I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Driven to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the evolution

Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution

// Worth Fighting For //

You said I could never find a way to ease your mind
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Desert heat can wear you down
But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze?
I am driven by a thirst to quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah!

Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
Beckoned by the glow of keresone & tumbleweed
They're calling out (they're calling out)
Forever more (forever more)

I'm leaning in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for

So I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah!

Worth fighting for

// Demonizer //

Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth

Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring

Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy

The beast of a god
Regalled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face

Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out!

Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's gideons quest
To take Satan's throne

The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel

A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverise all in its' wake

The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out

// Wheels Of Fire //

Born on the other side
Of the track
Gotta get outta here
I won't look back

Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive

Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll

Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
To tie me down

Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive

Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll

Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire forever

// Angel //

Angel - put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again

Oh angel - we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

And I know we'll find
A better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want - for you and me
Angel won't you set me free

Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun

When I close my eyes I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms - oh can't you see
Angel shine your light on me

Oh angel we'll meet once more - I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh! angel take me far away

Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again

// Hellrider //

Here they come
These gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed

Speed of death
Crossfired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares

Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution

Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight

All incensed to overthrow
Strong defence
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fates renowned
Put to rest
Abominations crown

Time to ram it down
Judgement for the tyrant

Hellrider
Roars through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight

Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and
Pain infernal
Honour bound in strength repleated
To no end they're undefeated

Hellrider, hellrider
You fought their battle for them

Hellrider, hellrider
You bought them through their despair

Hellrider, hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished

Hellrider, hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished

Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
For valiants never yield

Triumph to the gods
Vanquished of enslavers

Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill

Hellrider, hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider, hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider

// Eulogy //

And so now it comes to pass
By the eventide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class

For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the sentinel

So it goes forevermore
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor

// Lochness //

Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof

A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
It's leathered hide
Glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar

This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities on and on and on

Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress
Malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me

Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl

This highland lair of mystery
Retains a lost world's empathy
Resiliant to discovery on and on and on

This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternity
Your secret lies safe with me

This creatures peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace and on and on and on
