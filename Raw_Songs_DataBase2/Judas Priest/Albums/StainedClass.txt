// Exciter //

Racing' cross the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask

Everything he touches
Fries into a crisp,
Let him get close to you
So you're in his trip,
First you'll smoke and smoulder
Blister up and singe
When ignition hits you
the very soul of your being will cringe.

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please

Who is this man?
Where is he from?
Exciter comes
For everyone.
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue

He's come to make you snap out
Of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you
See the light again
So much self-indulgence
Results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency
Leads to beguiling lies.

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask

When he leaps amidst us
With combustive dance
All shall bear the branding
Of his thermal lance,
Cauterizing masses
Melting into one
Only when there's order
Will his job be done.

Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please

Who is this man?
Where is he from?
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue

Racing past the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand

Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter

// White Heat, Red Hot //

The father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy
Deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary
Lead us all into arena, magnificent in death
Well let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step

White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot

The fury songs, venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy
An overture forever more to senseless victories
Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill
So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of

White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot
The heat's hot burns a lot
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men

Prepare to fight, unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill
To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill
The centuries of dedication inherited till at last
From years of solar gladiation can only end in

White heat, red hot burns deep, white heat red hot
The heat's hot burns a lot
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men

White heat
Red hot
White heat
Red hot

// Better By You Better Than Me //

You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why I'm alive within
I can't find the words
My mind is dead
It's better by you better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts I've held so inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me

Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Don't wanna really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be

It's better by you better than me

Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say way all they can see

Better by you better than me

// Stained Class //

Wild-eyed and tight fisted, I'm fused to the bone
I stand contemplating, reacting alone
Impaled with betrayal
The tourniquet turns
Society's creation
Pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is
Faithless continuum, into the abyss
Fierce is my conviction, absolute my belief
I spit at you apathy, and seducer deceit

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Lethal, deadly, hung, drawn and quartered
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and utopian dreams
Whipping, stripping, peeling the flesh off, relentless and senseless
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep
To infest and decay from the core

Impaled with betrayal, the tourniquet turns
Society's creation, pole-axed out and burnt

Long ago when man was king, his heart was clean now he's stained class
Time has slashed each untouched thing, so now he's just a stained class king

Stained class king

// Invader //

I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow
I saw a seering flash of light erupt and skyward go
I staggered back in dazed surprise
What was it I had seen?
And as I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream

Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh

This is the first of more to come in carefully planned attacks
If it is so we must prepare defenses to fight back
The call is out throughout the world
United we must stand
To build a line, strategic force, they will not take a man

Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh

When they come to take control every man must play his role
They won't take our world away when the children we leave
Will have to believe in today

We warn you now you things out there
Whatever you may send
We won't give in without a fight, a fight until the end
With vigilance by day and night our scanners trace the sky
A shield is sealed upon this earth, a shield you won't get by

Invader invader nearby
Invader, invader is nigh

// Saints In Hell //

They laughed at their gods
And fought them in vain
So he turned his back on them
And left them in pain
Now here come the saints
With their banners held high
Each one of them martyrs
Quite willing to die

Wake the dead, the saints are in Hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell

Cover your fists
Razor your spears
It's been our possession
For 8,000 years
Fetch the scream eagles
Unleash the wild cats
Set loose the king cobras
And blood sucking bats

Wake the dead, the saints are in hell
Wake the dead, they've come for the bell

We are saints
In hell
We are saints
In hell
We're going down
Into the fire
We're going down
Into the fire

The streets run with blood from the mass mutilation
As carnage took toll for the bell

Abattoir, abattoir, mon Dieu quelle horreur
For a time is was like second hell

Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell

The battle is over, the saints are alive
How can we all thank you, we felt so despised

Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell
Saints in Hell

// Savage //

Who gives you the right to come here and tell me
I have to leave this place my home
To you it's a jungle, to me it's a kingdom
Where (my) people are free there to roam
Born with the stars we are happy and peaceful
'Til now we were left undisturbed
But you rupture the forests our gardens
And fill them with filth from your cities unheard

Savage, who is savage
Leave your morals, stake your claim
Savage, you are savage
Modern man can take the blame

You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man

Savage, who is savage
Leave your morals, stake your claim
Savage, you are savage
Modern man can take the blame

You poisoned my tribe with civilized progress
Baptizing our blood with disease
You christened our bodies with sadness and suffering
Saying then that your god is well-pleased
What have we done to deserve such injustice
Explain to us please if you can
But you can't, no you can't, we can see it in your eyes
Of us both who's the primitive man

Savage, savage
Savage, savage
Who's the savage
Modern man
Who's the savage
Modern man

// Beyond The Realms Of Death //

He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Withdrawn he'd sit there
Stare blank into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him
Goodbye - and then he died

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah! I will start again
It can take forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, but I'll still win.

How many like him,
Are there still
But to us, all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost

Yeah! I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life, this is my life
I'll decide not you

Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in

Beyond the realms of death

// Heroes End //

I heard a human voice who sang like no one else
I heard a proud lady singing loud
Lived her life as she liked, didn't give a damn
But soon she found she was underground and wasted

I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage
Her body shook oh, she did her stuff
She screamed and quake, give and take, maybe took too much
If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough

Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid

I heard a man's guitar electrify a crowd
I felt the sound shower 'round
And he would take you with him where no music's been before
As you merged the power surge together

His music knew no limits if you were in it's wake
You had no choice, no, but hear its voice
And you would listen hypnotized, and in a dream
But once so strong survive or become weak

Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid

If you gaze across timeless years you'll find them always there
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds

I saw on silver screen an actor's rise to fame
But fast car user lose
That legend's born from death and that is such a shame
'cos ev'ry year new ones appear

Why do you have to die to be a hero
It's a shame a legend begins at its end
Why do you have to die if you're a hero
When there's still so many things to say unsaid

// Fire Burns Below //

Stand and face each other
Don't know what to say
But that look in your eyes
Give it all away

You say you've got these feelings
You can't put into words
But you don't have to say a thing
'Cause I've already heard

Give me one good reason
Why this has to be
That's all I'm asking for

Don't say that it's over
When you and I both know
You can't put out this love
The fire burns below

We've been through so much together
We've laughed and we've sometimes cried
To say our love ain't working - well we
Haven't really tried

But why let's talk things over
Love can't be bought and sold
One more night together's what the future holds
What the future holds

Well give me one good reason
Why this has to be
I said that's all I'm asking for
Can't you see I said

You can't put out the fire down below

// Better By You, Better Than Me (Live) //

"Better by you...
Better than me..."

You could find a way to ease my passion
You listen to the blood flow in my veins
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her why I'm alive within
I can't find the words
My mind is dead
It's better by you better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak up thoughts I've held so inside
Tell her now I got to go
Out in the streets and down the shore
Tell her the world's not much living for
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say what I only can see
It's better by you better than me

Guess I'll have to change my way of living
Don't wanna really know the way I feel
Guess I'll learn to fight and kill
Tell her not to wait until
They'll find my blood upon her windowsill
It's better by you better than me

Everybody
Everybody knows
Everybody
Everybody knows
Better by you better than me

You can say what I only can see
You can tell what I want it to be

It's better by you better than me

Better by you better than me

You can tell what I want it to be
You can say way all they can see

Better by you better than me
