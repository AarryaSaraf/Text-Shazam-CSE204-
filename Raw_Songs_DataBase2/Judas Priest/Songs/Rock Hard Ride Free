Get a grip on the action
Moving heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth

No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Tough as steel
Stop at nothing
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race

No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Rock hard with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Die hard resolution
That is true to the end

No denying we're going against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life...
