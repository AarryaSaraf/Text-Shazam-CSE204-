I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
The steel and leather guys were fooling with the denim dudes
A couple cops playing rough stuff, New York, Fire Island

I cased the joint, straining at the seams

I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled "Give me a bourbon"
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact

Then the big boys, saw me and knew that

I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours

Sex like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures, not colors
The true free expression I demand is human rights - right

I gave my life, I am immortal

Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws
Love knoweth no laws

Nightmare, just a bunch of goddamn, rotten, steaming, raw
Deal
