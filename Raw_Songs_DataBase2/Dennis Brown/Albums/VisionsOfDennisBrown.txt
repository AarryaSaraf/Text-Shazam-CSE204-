// Concrete Castle King //

Concrete castle king, won't you give us a helping hand?
Concrete castle king, I hope you will understand
We're suffering

Living in your concrete castle on the hill
You don't know what life is like in the ghetto
Living in a two-by-four with no place to walk around, no-no
While you're in a castle all alone

I said concrete castle king, won't you give us a helping hand?
Concrete castle king, I hope you will understand
We're suffering, yeah

Life isn't easy in the ghetto, no
It's hard to keep from getting into trouble
The temptation is great
And you don't have no-one to say "Don't do it"
No-no-no-no

Concrete castle king, we do need your help
Woooaah, yeah

Many days we stand in the rain and sun
Waiting for the bus that never comes
You pass by in your fancy car
Wearing a plastic smile and smoking a big cigar

So concrete castle king, won't you give us a helping hand?
Concrete castle king, I hope you will understand
We're suffering, wooooaahhh yeah
We're suffering
We do need your help, yeah
Concrete castle king
