// Love Has Found Its Way //

Love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today

When your love is beautiful
There's nothing, nothing that can go wrong
When two hearts beat together
It's like an everlasting song
It's like an everlasting song

The moon shines bright over yonder
And it makes me feel so fine
I'm so thankful, so thankful, baby
That Jah has made you mine
I'm so thankful that Jah has made you mine

'Cause love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today

Oh baby, please let me stay with you
This love is so hard to resist
Let me feel your loving kindness
And all your tenderness

Oh lady, you make me so very happy
Even a blind man could see
That love can be so beautiful
Love that's meant to be
Love that's meant to be

'Cause love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today

Oh lady, oh lady
You bring me up, you bring me up
I'm never, I'm never gonna let you
Slip through my fingers
No way, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh lady, let me stay
Let me stay in your heart
Love is so hard to resist
And most, and most of all, love, love is real

// Handwriting On The Wall //

Whoa oi, whoa oi, yeah

Have you read your newspapers lately
Looks like mankind has surely gone crazy
Making bombs that leave buildings but kill babies
Believe in the Book of Revelations

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall, yeah ah
Signs are clear, they're telling us all

Oh, well, false prophets are plenty
Preaching lies to the few and the many
Even the changes of the seasons
Bring disaster and destruction for a reason

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all

Making bombs that leave buildings but kill babies
Believe in the Book of Revelations

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall, well
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall..

// Blood, Sweat And Tears //

My woman she is willing and able
Ain't no devil, no
Oh Lord, see

I woke up this morning
With no bread on my table
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is gritting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me

Everyone's playing their game and tear
I just can't get my equal share
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is getting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me, whoa oh

I woke up this morning
With no bread on my table
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is gritting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me

Everyone's playing their game and tear
I just can't get my equal share
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is getting stronger

And every day...

// Halfway Up, Halfway Down //

Many a problems, many a joy
Life can be fun but never a toy
Many a good times, many a bad
Thankful for all those times that I've had
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And if I'm blessed With another day
At least I have found life's middle ground
Halfway up, halfway down
Oh whoa, yeah-ah

Many a sorrows, many a pain
Better a person I have became
Many a laugh and many a smile
Building up from ah every down
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And I'm blessed with another day

Halfway up, whoa oh, halfway down
Ooh.. oh whoa, well

Have found themselves
Also right where I am
Many a lifetime, many a day
Searching to find a better way
And when the sun comes tomorrow
And I'm blessed with another day

Halfway up, halfway down

Oh, whoa, well

Many a sorrows, many a fame
That of the person I have became

// Any Day Now //

Any day now
I will hear you say goodbye my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes
Meet someone new
Oh to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay

Any day now
When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around
No, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Well.. why oh why..

Woke up that morning, feeling despair
Something is on my mind, I felt so scared, yea
As time keeps moving on and my baby is gone too long
And I know I need a coming hom
And someone to keep me warm
At home and I know there's no need to come home

'Cause I, couldn't stand losing you

And wanting so much to hold you tight
Can't fight my feelings, got to let it show
And oh, it aches so much
Now I know

I, couldn't stand losing you..
