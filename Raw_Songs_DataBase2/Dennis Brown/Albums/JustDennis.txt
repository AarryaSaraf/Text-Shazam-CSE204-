// Westbound Train //

Whoo, ooh, yeah

Last night I weren't at home
I just went for a stroll
But when I returned, I saw this note
Underneath my door, stating

You'll never ever see me again
So now our love must end
You'll never ever see me again
My friend 'cause

I'll be taking this train
I'll be taking westbound train
I'll be going to place
Where there is happiness

So you'll never ever see me again
I'll be taking westbound train
You'll never ever see me again
My friend

No, you'll never ever see me

Whoa, cherry baby
I've gotta find you baby

'Cause I'll never live in a world like that
You want to make me feel sad
And now I'm in very, very steep position
So that's why this train won't miss me
'Cause I've got to find my cherry baby

You'll never ever see me, no
[?]

Whoa, cherry baby
I've gotta find you baby

'Cause I'll never live in a world like that
You want to make me feel sad
And now I'm in very, very steep position
So that's why this train won't miss me
'Cause I've got to find my cherry baby

// Silver Words //

Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're nice
Don't think I'm kidding you
And don't think I'm bidding
That silver words are you're price

And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me

Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're mine
Don't think I'm kidding
And don't think I'm bidding
These silver words are you're price

And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me

Would chance with me
Chance with me
