Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
And I've got my song to sing

Rivers got to flow; winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so
Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all

Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
And I've got my song to sing

Rivers got to flow; winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so
I got my song to sing
Wonders of the world never cease to be
Jah creates them all; Jah tells it so
I want the world to know

Birds got to fly; babies got to cry
Fish got to swim
Rivers got to flow; the winds got to blow
We all got to know Jah made it so
