Hey, you know just how to hurt me
And how to take all my fears away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise

There were times I thought you knew
That I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes

Well, you know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else could see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, oh

So in love, so in love with the games that you play
So in love, nothing can take me away
No, no, no, no, wait now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Lady, whoa

You got a way of confusing a heart
Nobody else could know
Why should I try, I don't wanna get over you, no, no, no, no

I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, oh, no
I don't know why I keep coming back to you

Girl, you know how to hurt me
And to take all my fears away, oh
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise, eyes

And, there were times I thought you knew
That I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness
