Rough as the road might seem to be
I'll be toiling on home
I'll be myself and no one
I'll keep trodding on

A man must go through tribulation
No matter who or where he's from
If he's a man of understanding
He then know that time alone will tell

But fools know not of understanding
That's why they stumble
Never going to their way, oh, yeah
For wisdom is hard for them
