I'm sure my days will be long
And my nights won't be few
Through the vision that's in me
I can see clearly
Where there is gonna be peace
Love and harmony, black understanding
Among my people, whoa yes, among my people

They're gonna jump and shout
Black liberation dey-ya, oh yes
We're gonna sing and shout
The right understanding dey-ya, oh yes

They're gonna jump and shout
Black liberation dey-ya, oh yes
We're gonna sing and shout
The right understanding dey-ya, oh yes
Men and people will try to, cut you down
Trying their very best to rearrange you
But no matter what they do
They won't conquer you, no matter what they do

Oh no we gonna free our brothers
We gonna free our brothers
We gonna help our brothers
We gonna love our sisters

And we're gonna jump and shout
Black liberation dey-ya, oh yes
We're gonna sing and shout
The right understanding dey-ya, oh yes

We're gonna jump and shout
Black liberation dey-ya, oh yes
We're gonna sing and shout
The right understanding dey-ya, oh yes
