How do you feel
Knowing you're like a meal deal, eh
Your lips are surreal
As if of cherrylade, oh-oh-oh
Your words are softly spoken, yeah-yes
And you seem to be a very nice person, yeah

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
With nature that can never go cold
My happiness lies in you
With everything that is blind so true

Angel in disguise, you're my
Angel in disguise, yes, yeah

What are your fancies?
Are they far reaching?
Or even moreso appealing, yeah
Tell me something
Could you be coming? Yeah
Through a world of emptiness, ah yeah, eh

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
Let the truth be unfold, eh
And stay in the air, ooh, can you?
I'm so amazed, I'm even dazed

Angel in disguise, oh
You're my angel in disguise, yeah, nah
Whoa-oh-oh, oh nah, oh yeah
You're my angel in disguise, yes, eh

How do you feel
Knowing you're like a meal deal, eh
Your lips are surreal
As if of cherrylade, oh yeah

It seem your heart's made of gold, yes
Let the truth be unfold
Am standing here looking at you
I'm so amazed, I'm even dazed

Angel in disguise, oh
You're my angel in disguise, yes
You're my angel in disguise, oh, yeah
My angel in disguise
