Love and hate can never be friends
Oh no, oh no

Here I come with love and not hatred
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow I
All the days of I life

Envy no one, no wish to be with no evil man
For there'll come the day
When you'll be whipped by the father's hand

Live up roots children
Live up rasta children

My head is anointed and my cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow I, all the days of I life
