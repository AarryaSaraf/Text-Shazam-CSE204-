Ooh
Oh baby go
Oh yeah, well yeah

Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now
Yeah!

There ain't no change around you baby, you can go now
Ain't gonna hold you down or mess you up, now no how
Go now, look for what you've been missing, get it out of your system
Follow your heart

Go do it all, try everything, it's ok baby
Go and have a ball, if that's your thing baby, it's ok baby
Go now, don't feel bad there's no need to
That's the deal we agreed too, right from the start

Oh baby go, chase your world with it's rainbow skies
It can make you sing or make you cry
And it can fill your heart with sorrow
Just like mine is now, filled with sorrow
Go now, baby go now, but remember me (yeah) tomorrow
Remember me tomorrow, yes!
Yeah! Well yeah yeah yeah
Go now!...

Go now, don't feel bad there's no need to

But remember me tomorrow
Remember me tomorrow

Yeah, go on now baby
Yeah! Well yeah yeah yeah
Baby go now...
