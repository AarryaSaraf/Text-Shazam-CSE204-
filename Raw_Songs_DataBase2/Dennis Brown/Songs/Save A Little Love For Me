Oh, whoa, yeah

You may say I'm dreaming
I know I'm dreaming
I got to take things in my own stride
And ride with the tide

What I want is to be with you, girl
To live in your world
For this passion I feel
Is real

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa yeah

I might 
I leave a beer cold
When your love's strong
And calling for more

Gotta find me a way
In your love I'll stay
For this loneliness I must confess
Girl, it's too much for me to bear

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I will need
Save a little love for me
Oh, right

Ooh yeah, oh, whoa, yeah
Lead me to your world

As you may say I'm dreaming
I know I'm dreaming
I got to take things in my own stride
And ride with the tide

What I want is to be with you, girl
To live in your world
For this passion I feel
It's real

Save a little love for me
That's all I need
Save a little love for me
Whoa, yeah

Save a little love for me
That's all I need
Save a little love for me

Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, all I need
Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, save it

Save a little love for me, all I need
Save a little love for me
Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, all I need

Save a little love for me
Why don't you save it, save it
Save a little love for me
