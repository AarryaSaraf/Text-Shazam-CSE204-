Oh yeh
So Jah say
I must not let him down
I must not let him down

'Cause if I do
I'm gonna have to pay
If I do I'm gonna have to pay
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
Let him down
So Jah say
I must not let him down
Let him down
No matter where you run
To for rescue this day
He's gonna find you anyway
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
No let him down

To fear of the Lord
Is to hate evil
Pride and arrogancy, oh
And the evil way
So Jah say
I said the fear of the Lord
Is to hate evil
Pride and arrogancy, oh
And the evil way
So Jah say, no, no, no
No let him down
Let him down

Not one of his seed
Shall sit on the sidewalk and beg bread
There'll never be, there'll never be
Not one of his seed
Shall be a living dead
