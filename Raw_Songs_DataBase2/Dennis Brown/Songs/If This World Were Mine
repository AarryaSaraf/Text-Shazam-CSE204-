Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If this world were mine I'd play rub-a-dub all the time
And I'd play it any style, play it all the while
Play it in a rub-a-dub style, play it in a different style
I'd play it any time, play it all the while

If this world were only mine
Oh-oh, if this world were only mine

If this world were mine I'd play rub-a-dub all the time
And I'd play it anyhow play it all the while
And I'd play it in a different style, play it all the while
Play it in a rub-a-dub style, play it all the while (Woah-oy)

Oh-oh-oh, yeah now, why-hey, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah now, woah-oh, why, yeah, yes I

And if my neighbor should complain about the sound
I'd play it all night long
'Cause I don't care about a what they say
Don't care about them feeling

'Cause I'd play it, play it all the while
Play it in a rub-a-dub style, play it all the while
Oh-oh, I'd play it, play anyhow, play it all the while
Play it in a rub-a-dub style (Woah yeah)
Play it all the while, yeah

Music is the stock of life
And if you have it, nah go lose it
