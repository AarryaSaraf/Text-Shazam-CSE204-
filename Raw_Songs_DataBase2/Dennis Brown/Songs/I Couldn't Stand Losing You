Whoa oh
Whoa oh, well
Yeah-ah, ya, yeah

I, couldn't stand losing you
I, couldn't stand losing you
I couldn't stand losing you-oo-oo, ya
I, couldn't stand losing you
No, no - no, no
No, no - no, no

Tossed and I turned, all night long
Wanting so much to hold you tight
Moved away my pillow, gone, you were gone
And oh, it aches so much
Now I know

I, couldn't stand losing you
I, couldn't stand losing you
I, couldn't stand losing you-oo-oo, ya
I, couldn't stand losing you

Woke up that morning, feeling despair
Something is on my mind, I felt so scared, yea
As time keeps moving on and my baby is gone too long
And I know I need a coming hom
And someone to keep me warm
At home and I know there's no need to come home

'Cause I, couldn't stand losing you
I, couldn't stand losing you, no, no
I, couldn't stand losing you-oo-oo, ya, ya
I, couldn't stand losing you
No, no - no, no
No, no - no, no

Tossed and I turned. all night long
And wanting so much to hold you tight
Can't fight my feelings, got to let it show
And oh, it aches so much
Now I know

I, couldn't stand losing you-oo-oo, ya, ya
I, couldn't stand losing you..
