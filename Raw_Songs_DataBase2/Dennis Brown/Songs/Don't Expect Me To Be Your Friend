Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh

I stopped sending flowers to your apartment
You said you weren't at home much anymore
I stopped dropping by without an appointment
But I heard laughter coming through your door
Sometimes late at nights, you'll still call me
Just before you close your eyes to sleep (Yeah)
You make me a vow to try and stop by sometimes
But baby, that's a promise I can't keep

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Oh, why

You always act so happy when I see you
You smile that way, you take my hand and then
Introduce me to your latest lover
That's when I feel the wall starts crashing in

I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, let's just leave the story at an end (Yeah)
I love you too much to ever start liking you
So, don't expect of me to be your friend

Woah, sweet lady
Uh-uh-uh
I love-love-love you too much (Yeah)
