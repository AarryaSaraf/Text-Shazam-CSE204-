Oh yeah, now, now
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl

You're like an angel to me
You always give your sympathy
When I'm exhausted, feeling low
I always know just where to go

You touch my hand, you always understand
The little things that hurt me inside
Father, I thank thee for sending me this ebony guy
When I be in misery, girl, it's just you that I see

Oh yeah, now
You drive away the pains from me
Sometimes you're like a broken baby

If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
If I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
I'd give it to you, girl, oh yeah, yeah

Oh yeah, now
When I be in misery, girl, it's just you that I see
You drive away the pains from me
Sometimes you're like a broken baby

Yeah, if I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
Yeah, if I had the world, I'd give it to you, girl
Girl, if I only had the world, I'd give it to you
