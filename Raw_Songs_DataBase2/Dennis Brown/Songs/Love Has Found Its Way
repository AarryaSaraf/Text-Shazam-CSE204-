Love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today

When your love is beautiful
There's nothing, nothing that can go wrong
When two hearts beat together
It's like an everlasting song
It's like an everlasting song

The moon shines bright over yonder
And it makes me feel so fine
I'm so thankful, so thankful, baby
That Jah has made you mine
I'm so thankful that Jah has made you mine

'Cause love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today

Oh baby, please let me stay with you
This love is so hard to resist
Let me feel your loving kindness
And all your tenderness

Oh lady, you make me so very happy
Even a blind man could see
That love can be so beautiful
Love that's meant to be
Love that's meant to be

'Cause love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today

Oh lady, oh lady
You bring me up, you bring me up
I'm never, I'm never gonna let you
Slip through my fingers
No way, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh lady, let me stay
Let me stay in your heart
Love is so hard to resist
And most, and most of all, love, love is real
