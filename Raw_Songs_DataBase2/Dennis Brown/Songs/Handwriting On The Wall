Whoa oi, whoa oi, yeah

Have you read your newspapers lately
Looks like mankind has surely gone crazy
Making bombs that leave buildings but kill babies
Believe in the Book of Revelations

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall, yeah ah
Signs are clear, they're telling us all

Oh, well, false prophets are plenty
Preaching lies to the few and the many
Even the changes of the seasons
Bring disaster and destruction for a reason

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all

Well, ah yeah, yeah
Oh, oh oh whoa, ooh, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, well, now well, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Whoa, whoa

Have you read your newspapers lately
Looks like mankind has surely gone crazy
Making bombs that leave buildings but kill babies
Believe in the Book of Revelations

And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall, well
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall..
