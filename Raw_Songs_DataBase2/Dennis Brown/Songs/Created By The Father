Look at the trees; how their leaves are blowing away in the sky
Listen to the birds; how they're singing away their time
Look at the sun; how it shines bright in the sky
All these things were created by the father
Look at the grass; how it make your lawns look pretty
Look at the flowers; how it make your gardens look pretty too
Even when you're feelin' weary, tired and low
All you've got to do is
Relax and feel the cool wind blow

Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, woah, yeah
What a beautiful seeing (Uh)

Look at the trees; how their leaves are blowing away in the sky

Look at the flowers; how it make your gardens look pretty too
Even when you're feelin' weary, tired and low
All you've got to do is
Relax and feel the cool wind blow

What a beautiful seeing (Yeah)
