By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy
By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy, yeah

Remember that Friday night
When you stole my pants off the line
So please tell me how you wanna make love to me

Whoa, girl
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater

Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa oh girl, oh girl, whoa girl

Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa, girl, whoa
