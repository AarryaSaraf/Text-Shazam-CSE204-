Uh-uh, let me tell you, baby

There is something about you I simply adore
This is what keeps us together
That makes my love for you grow (Wo-ho-ho!)
I found more joy; in you, my darling
That I could never find in any other girl
And I want to trade it (Oh, no!)
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)

'Cause, I could never let you go
I love you madly

If you should ever choose another
It will shallow all my dreams
But I love you so much more, my darling
More like water from the flowing stream (Eh-eh)
If you should ever leave me
It will surely-surely-surely kill me
And I wouldn't want to live
Without the love you give

'Cause, I need you baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)
I love you, I love you madly (Baby-baby, I love you madly)

They say that love comes an' goes
Just like a morning sun (Oh-oh)
But I love you so much more, my darling
That anybody could ever love anyone
Baby-baby, come closer (Closer)
Just a little bit closer (Closer)
And let me whisper in your ear

Darling, I love you more than I do yesterday
But not as half as I will tomorrow

I found more joy; in you, my darling
That I could never find in any other girl
And I want to trade it (Oh, no!)
For nothing in this world, baby (Baby-baby, I love you madly)
I love you, I love you madly (Baby-baby, I love you madly)
