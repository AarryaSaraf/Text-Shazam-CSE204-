That's alright (Yeah)
Woah, woah, you know what I mean (Hey)

Can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down (No)
Said, who feels it, oh yes, he knows it
Can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down
Said, who feels it, oh yes, he knows it
Oh yes, who feels it, woah, he knows it
Woah-woah, hey

You see, you render your hearts an' not your garments
To step in the kingdom of Jah
Though they try to stop I an' I
They could never get away, I know, I know (Yeah)

Can't keep a good man down
I said, you can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down (Oh woy)
Yes, who feels it, and I know, he shows it
Just like I said, who feels it
