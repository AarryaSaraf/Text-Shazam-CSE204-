Yes, your boasting
Can only be, for a time, yeah
Whoa oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh - yeah

Your boasting, can only be for a time
Yes, you're boasting, but you'll never survive, no
'Cause today you are up and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me, yeah

So what's the use in
Pretending to your brother
That you'll love him
And behind you're trying to kill them, yes
Gotta wake up, gotta, you gotta wake up to reality

...
Yeah, yeah - whoa, whoa, whoa, well, yeah, now
Ooh, yeah

I said your boasting, can only be for a time
Yes, you're boasting, but you'll never survive no
'Cause today you are up and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me, yeah

So what's the use in
Pretending to your brother, yeah
That you'll love him
And behind you're trying to kill them, yes
Gotta wake up, gotta, you gotta wake up to reality
'Cause you're boasting, but you'll never survive, no, no, no

'Cause today you are up, yeah and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me..
