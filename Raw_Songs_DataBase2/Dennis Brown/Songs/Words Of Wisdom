Whoa! Whoa yeah nah
I will open my mouth in a parable, and sing the dark sayings of old
And much wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
Unto you, o children, I cry

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Ooh, ooh, whoa yeah yeah nah nah, oh yeah. Ooh, woah yeah

In laughter the heart is sorrowful
Your folly is your reward
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than feasting where there is wrath

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Whoa yeah now now... Whoa... yeah! Ooh ooh yeah... oh yeah now

So take heed Jah-people, and live upright, for this is the time that will tell
When the righteous ones shall stand up strong
Oh why did the heathen rage?

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Whoa yeah now... mmm... Oh yeah, said you will surely fail! Oh yeah now... mmm... Oh yeah now

So I will open my mouth in a parable, and sing the dark sayings of old
So much wisdom and knowledge stretch forth their hands
Unto you, o children, I cry

All the words of my mouth speak righteousness
All the days of my life will tell
Take heed of the words of Jehovah, or men you will surely fail
Ooh mmm. Oh yeah now mmm. Ooh mmm. Whoa yeah now now

Live up, live up, now now, live up! Never give up righteousness
Oh yeah now, keep it up, son, follow the footsteps of your father
Oh yeah nah now. Words of wisdom, words of wisdom, words of wisdom I hold to. I said I hold to, ooh...
