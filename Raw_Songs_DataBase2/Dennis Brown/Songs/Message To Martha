Spread your wings, yea..

Spread your wings for New Orleans;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away
And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
She sings tonight in some cafe
In her search to find wealth and fame
I hear Martha has gone and changed her name, yea

It's a year since she was here;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
Tell her I miss her more each day
As her train pulled out, down the track
Martha promised she'll soon be coming back

Wooh tell her how my heart just breaks, in two
Since she journeyed far..
And even though her dreams of fame fell through
To me she will always be a star

It's a year since she was here, woo;
Kentucky bluebird, fly away

And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
Tell her I miss her more each day
As her train pulled out, down the track
Martha promised she'll soon be coming back, woo, yea!

Wooh, fly away, Kentucky bluebird;
Fly away, Kentucky bluebird;
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly away..
