Oh yeah, woah-oy, woah-oy yeah, hey

You really had me believing
That you were true
And I didn't need conviction
I was so in love with you

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, woah-oh, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

Now, we had a good thing going
You said so yourself
But you were only deceiving
'Cause you love someone else

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah-oh, why, why, why

Now, you really had me believing
That you were true
And I didn't need conviction
I was so in love with you

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no-no, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, let me down

Now, we had a good thing going
You said so yourself
But you were only deceiving
'Cause you love someone else

Although I heard it on the street that you played around, girl
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down
I never thought that you would ever
Let me down, no, let me down

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
You're deceiving, you're deceiving, so convincing
While I'm feeling, yeah
Woah-oh-oh yeah, woah yeah
