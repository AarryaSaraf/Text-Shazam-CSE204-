(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

What a man has, is his own business
It didn't come easy
Blood, sweat and tears, throughout the years
Satisfy, don't be greedy
All you watching and peeping
Envying another man's wealth
Instead of sit and criticizing
Try a little thing for yourself

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh whoa
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

If you mess with your family
Even my girl and me
Best friends turn worst enemies
All because of jealousy

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, yeah
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

What a man has, is his own business
It didn't come easy
Blood, sweat and tears, throughout the years
Satisfy, don't be greedy
All you watching and peeping
Envying another man's wealth
Instead of sit and criticizing
Try a little thing for yourself

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh yeah
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy

If you mess with your family
Even my girl and me
Best friends turn worst enemies
All because of jealousy

(Jealousy, jealousy) Will bring disunity
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, ooh whoa
(Jealousy, jealousy) Turns friends into enemy
(Jealousy, jealousy) Red eye and envy, oh Lord

(Jealousy, jealousy) All because of jealousy, yeah
Will bring disunity, yeah (jealousy, jealousy)
Even with your family, wooy (jealousy, jealousy)
Red eye and envy (jealousy, jealousy)

Jealousy, jealousy...
