I was appointed, to say this
My love, is mercy
Accept it for what it's worth
My love, is pure and true
I'll never lead you astray

Jah love, is merciful
Reaching out for this world
This love, is everlasting
Shining bright as a morning star

So in your time of desperation
You won't be despised or even be trampled on, no
If only you'd given him, your heart and soul
Frustration, depression, confusion, you'll overcome

Jah, love is everlasting, yeah
It's reaching out for the world
His love, is pure and true
Shining bright as a morning star

Yes in your time of temptation
Don't let the devil, lead you to destruction, no
Just let you heart be pure and true
And you'll have endless days, awaiting you

Oh yeah, now, now
Oh yeah

Yes in your time of desperation
You won't be despised, or even be trampled on, no
If only you'd given him, your heart and soul
Frustration, depression, confusion, you'll overcome

Jah love, is everlasting, yeah
It's reaching out for the world
My love, is pure and true
I'll never lead you astray

Jah love, is merciful
Shining bright as a morning star
