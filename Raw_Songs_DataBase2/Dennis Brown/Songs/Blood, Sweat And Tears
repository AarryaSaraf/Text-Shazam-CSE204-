My woman she is willing and able
Ain't no devil, no
Oh Lord, see

I woke up this morning
With no bread on my table
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is gritting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me

Everyone's playing their game and tear
I just can't get my equal share
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is getting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me, whoa oh

I woke up this morning
With no bread on my table
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is gritting stronger

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me

Everyone's playing their game and tear
I just can't get my equal share
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able
Take it easy she said
Jah is alive and you must survive
I can't hold out much longer
The wicked is getting stronger

And every day...
