I got a black magic woman
I got a black magic woman
I've got a black magic woman
Got me so blind, I can't see, well
That she's a black magic woman
She's trying to make a devil out of me

You turn your back on me, baby, well
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Don't turn your back on me, baby
Stop messing around with your tricks
Don't turn your back on me, baby, 'cause
You might just wake up my magic sticks, well
...

Got your spell on me, baby
Got your spell on me, baby
You've got your spell on me, baby
Turnin' my heart into stone
I need you so bad
Magic woman I can't leave you alone

Ah... yeah
I just, I just, I just, just
Can't leave you alone
Got your spell on me, baby
Got your spell, baby
