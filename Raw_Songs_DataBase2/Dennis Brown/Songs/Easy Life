I'm asking a question
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me? Lord

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me, woo
Would you give up your easy life and your luxury

There are two roads before you
And you've gotta make a choice
Would you give up your prince for this pauper
Would you make that sacrifice?
Girl, you know that I treat you good
And you're well looked after
I've given you an easy life
Filled with fun and laughter

Be careful when you make your decision
Remember I'm a man on a mission
What I start I just don't quit
Are you ready for that relationship?

Here's my heart - you can have it
And everything you'll ever need, yeah
