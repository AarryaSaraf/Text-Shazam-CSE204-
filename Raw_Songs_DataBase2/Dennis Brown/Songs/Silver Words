Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're nice
Don't think I'm kidding you
And don't think I'm bidding
That silver words are you're price

And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me

Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're mine
Don't think I'm kidding
And don't think I'm bidding
These silver words are you're price

And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me

Would chance with me
Chance with me
