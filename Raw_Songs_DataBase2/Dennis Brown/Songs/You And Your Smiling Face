You and your smiling face
Doesn't mean a thing, to me
Any man will pick you up
Just because of that smile you've got

But after knowing you as much as I
He's gonna leave you.. just like I did

The smile, you were smiling dear
Did excite me so much, that I had a feeling
I never had before

But after knowing you I had to run
Because it's only a smile you've got

The smile, you were smiling dear
Did excite me so much
That I.. had a feeling
I never had before

But after knowing you.. I had to run
Because it's only a smile you've got
Because it's only a smile you've got
