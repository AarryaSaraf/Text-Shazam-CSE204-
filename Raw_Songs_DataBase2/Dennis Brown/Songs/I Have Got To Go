I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

She left me without a 
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry
She left me without a 
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry

I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

I; I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear
I; I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear

She left me without a 
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry
She left me without a 
She even broke my heart
And now she left me to cry

I, I've got to go
I've got to go, my dear (Wo-ho!)
