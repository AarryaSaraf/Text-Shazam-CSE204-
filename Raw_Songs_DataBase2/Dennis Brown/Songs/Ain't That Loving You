You think I love you for just one thing
To you my love it may, be the way it seems
But I love, the way you, carry yourself
I even love you, you, for what you may become

Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons, than one, oh yeah
Somehow my love, you've been misled yeah
By the things, other men said
But I love the way, you carry yourself
I even love you, for what you may become

Ain't that loving you, yeah, yeah
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one, oh yes it is, yeah, yeah
Did it ever, occur to you
Why I do all that any man can do, yeah
You keep a smile on your face
It's because I love you, I love you, I love you
In so many ways

Somehow my love, you've been misled yeah
By the things, other men said
But I love the way, you carry yourself
I even love you, for what you may become

Ain't that loving you, yeah
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons, than one
Don't you know I love you
From the depths of my heart
Darling I love you, I love you, I love you
