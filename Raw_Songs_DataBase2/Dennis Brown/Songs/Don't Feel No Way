Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play

Oh mister D.J. music is
The love of my life
If the day should ever come
When music stop playing
I don't want to be around

So don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play

When I'm feeling
Down and out
Music is my only relief
And if you can't dig the score
Come on and brutalise my very soul
Don't feel no way
Feel no way

Oh loving music
Without you in my life
Love wouldn't worth a dime
And oh its such a crime
Love you in the morning
I love you in the evening too
I love you right next to the
Almighty one

Mister music
Let Jah music play
Hit me with music
You know I can't refuse it

Don't feel no way
