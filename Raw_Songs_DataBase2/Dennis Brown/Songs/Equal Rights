Every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Treat him right, Lord, and oh, treat him good
Take a tip from me, don't hang him on a tree
We should never give against another man

'Cause every man has an equal right to live and be free
No matter what colour, class or race he may be

Remember how we're all one flesh and blood
Keep your brother up, don't push him in the mud
We should never give against another man (No, no-no)
