Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like a guy whose feet are too
Big for his bed, nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are falling on my head (They keep falling)

So, I just need me some talking to the sun
And I'll say that didn't like the way
He got things done, sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are falling on my head (They keep falling)

And there's one thing I know
The blues' day set to leave me
Won't defeat me, it won't be long 'till
Happiness steps up to greet me (Baby!)

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cries are for me ('Cause)
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free (Yeah)
Without things worrying me (Oh yeah)

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cries are for me ('Cause)
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complaining
Because I'm free (Yeah)
Nothing's worrying me (Oh yeah)
