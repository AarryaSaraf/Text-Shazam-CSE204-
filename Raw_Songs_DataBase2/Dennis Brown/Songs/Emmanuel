The lord God he is with us, yes
He gave us the moon
And the stars and his blessing
No regrets, no sorrow, nor pain, no no
Oh Jacob, he recalls the name

My people don't be misled
Come along
My people think wise instead
Children
My people don't be misled
My people think wise instead

Here we are singing and dancing
Together like one family
We all know, we all know
We all know what it is to be free
Lets all sing and  enmity, no no

My people don't be misled
Come along
My people think wise instead
Children
My people don't be misled
My people think wise instead
