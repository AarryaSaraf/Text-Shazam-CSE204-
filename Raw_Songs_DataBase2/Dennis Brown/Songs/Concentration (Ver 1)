Holy holy, hmm, holy holy

It started settle down in the drag to concentrate
And getting a weekly pay instead of begging every day
Father gave us every little thing to make us try
And help ourselves and He said He'd help those
Who try to help their selves

So if you want to be in that situation
Change your evil ways and join this congregation
And maybe you'll soon be living like the King
That sitteth on His throne
If happiness is far away, it will show up some day

Holy holy, holy holy

If you want to live that independent life
Go out and do the work instead of being in a fight
Father knows that you're the chosen one
To perform His works
And you'll be repaid in His holy way

In His holy way, yeah, yeah
In His holy way, yeah, holy way, yeah, holy way
