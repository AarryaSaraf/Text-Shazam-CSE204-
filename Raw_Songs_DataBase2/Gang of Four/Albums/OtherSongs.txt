// Elevator (Demo) //

Waiting for my elevator
I hear you don't want to delay her
I'm not looking for a confrontation
But she's looking for an explanation

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

I tell her that I'm for the first floor
She tells me that she's for the first floor
We wait until we get to the first floor
But she don't get out the door

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

Waiting for my elevator
I really don't know what to say her
There's something I really hate
I wish to God I could relate

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

Waiting for my elevator
I really don't want to delay her
I'm not looking for a confrontation
But she's looking for an explanation

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

// Ivanka (Things You Can't Have) //

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Where once were her eyes
Ivanka now sees through pearls
She said I don't know
What it means to be complicit
Be complicit

Need to believe
You got to understand
Need to believe
You got to understand

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

I saw how hard daddy worked for his money
Daddy loves women and he believes in family
Need to believe, you gotta understand
Need to believe

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
(Given to me)
Given to me

In the morning daddy wants me in his room, it's where we get together
It's not true that daddy calls my name in stormy weather

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Daddy loves women and he believes in family (In family)
He and I know the worst sins are lust and avarice (Lust and avarice)
Now we're a long way from home (A long way from home)
Now we're a long way from home

Someone said that we can make a better version of ourselves
You need to know I'll do my best for you (Do my best for you)
You need to know I'll do my best for you

// Producer //

Young producer paces to and fro
Sound of the playback fills the air
A man from EMI wears a suit and big smile
I don't hear songs, he says, just sound

Hey operator put some stuff on the line
Day in, day out, I hear the same hits
Keep yourself, free yourself from editing tape
No damn truth is cut and shaped

Young sits in the corner in the shadow
Talks to himself
Every day to all of my prayers
I take my songs to the marketplace
You can hear them shout
You can hear them shout
Lies on sale
Lies on sale
You can hear them shout
You can hear them shout
Lies on sale

// Sweet Jane //

Standin' on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest
And me I'm in a rock 'n' roll band. Huh.
Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
Ya know, those were different times
All, all the poets studied rules of verse
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane, whoa-uh!
Sweet Jane, oh-ho-uh!
Sweet Jane

I'll tell ya sump'n' now
Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she is a clerk
And both of them save their monies
When they get home from work
Oooh! Sittin' down by the fire, ohhh!
The radio does play
The classical music there, Jim
"The March of the Wooden Soldiers"
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say

(Get ready ya'll)
Sweet Jane
(C'mon baby doll)
Sweet Jane oh-oh-oh-oh-uh!
Sweet Jane

Some people, they like to go out dancin'
And other peoples, they have to work, just watch me now
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that, women never really feign
And that villains always blink their eyes, oooh!
And that, you know, children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die

But anyone who ever had a heart, ohh!
They wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who's ever played a part, ohh!
They wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane, oh-whoa-uh!
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

[This next part is only on the full length version of the song:]
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seem to whisper to her, hey when she smiles

La lala lala la, la lala lala la
La lala lala la, la lala lala la

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
