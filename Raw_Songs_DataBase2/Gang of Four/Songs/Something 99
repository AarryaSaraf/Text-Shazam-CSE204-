I volunteer to serve myself
Words, comma, sentence, end.
Addicted to sentiment
Hopes, postponed sleepless, end.
Necrophiliac desires
Cock culture, I defend
Overdose nostalgic rides
Pause, scarequotes, fullstop.

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99

I'm a consumer of myself
Reminiscence, and self love, end.
Memories I never had
Dash, semi colon

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
12 inch Jesus on the dash
Something 99

Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99
(Unintelligible)..all I can find
Something 99

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99
