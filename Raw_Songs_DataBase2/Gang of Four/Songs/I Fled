All inhibitions gone & on display
All innocence has gone & flown away
A winner now when that time there was none
To reinterpret all that's redundant
To be true to all my illusions
As for contentment all that's behind me
A loser now when I thought that I had won
No pearls now, none to speak of
To think of the past seems so uncool
I reconsidered fell into my swimming pool
I fled
