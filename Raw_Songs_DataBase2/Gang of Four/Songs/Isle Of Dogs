They call me obscene
There's just no empathy
But I'm at the top of the world
No one looks down on me
From commercial road
To the old city
Every day we invent
The economy


I look around, and I'm pleased
And I buy into everything I see
I buy in, I buy in
Into everything I see
Buy into everything
Into everything

I don't need to be liked
But join me on my journey
Sweet Thames run soft
'Til I end my story
Past the island of dogs
The river flows to the sea
The cradle of our wealth
She carries lovingly


I look around, and I'm pleased
And I buy into everything I see
I buy in, I buy in
Into everything I see
Buy into everything
Into everything

Let forgiveness be heard
I can change
Let forgiveness be heard
