He's so alienated he doesn't even understand
That, that what he's asking for is what he already knows
He would expect to masturbate

She's very two dimensional, you know, deliberately so
I mean she, in the interchange, she has no personality

She could be a tape recording

He knows she's real to the extent one knows anybody
Is real. You can't get away from that

She, who's the victim? Is he the victim?
