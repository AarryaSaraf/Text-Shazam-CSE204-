He's not a machine
But he's processing that code
Intermittent contacts
Arc as he overloads
You trust in fate
You trust in fate


He don't know
He don't sleep at night
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)

(He's talking, broken talk)
(He's talking, broken talk)

Where does he come from?
He's got an itch that won't be scratched
Sometimes he guesses he might be wrong
Sometimes, guesses that he don't belong
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate
But he checks out by days
Redeemer of coupons in a lonely mall


He don't know
He don't sleep at night
(He's talking, broken talk)
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)


Getting ill
Shakes by the steady
Self-medicator
It may come too late
Detereorating
Will he recuperate
It may come too late
He trusts in fate
He trusts in fate


He don't know
He don't sleep at night
(He's talking, broken talk)
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)

He don't know
He don't sleep at night
(He's talking, broken talk)
And so he's getting ill
He's in a waking dream
(He's talking, broken talk)


(He's talking, broken talk)
(He's talking, broken talk)
