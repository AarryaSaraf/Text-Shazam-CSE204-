Who is that?
Just what is your business
Fate is in your hands
And your decisions
A man with a good car needs no justification
Fate is in my hands and in the transmission
I know that you think that you know what I said
(Poor Tom, monkey on his back)
But do you realize that what I said's not what I meant
I don't have wise blood
I'm deep in mystery
I asked luck to dance
The lady she's the wallflower
Well, she played the good cop
Took identification
Said "Don't trust to chance
Or believe in what you can't touch"
A man with a good car needs no justification
Fate is in my hands and in the transmission
