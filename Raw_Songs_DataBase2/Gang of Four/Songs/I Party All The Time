We are not prisoners - although we're putting in the hours
We are not innocent - although we're singing in the choir
If there's a revolution then you'll stay at home
You want to pay the ransom but don't know who to phone
If there should be a rapture you won't get chose
If there's an invitation, you won't get told!

Every night you dress as lover's bait
Give yourself to someone that you hate

I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
I'm a party to the crime
I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
And I party all the time

You're not a candidate - but you always have opinions
You're not a volunteer - although it ended in conscription

If there's a revolution don't know who to phone
Although you paid a ransom you won't go home
If there should be a rapture you won't get chose
If there's an invitation, you won't get told!

Every day you wish you could repent
Give back all the favours you were lent

I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
I'm a party to the crime
I'm not innocent - Complicit, I'm not it, I'm a phoney!
And I party all the time
And I party all the time

I'm not innocent
I'm not innocent. I'm a phoney
And I party all the time

I'm not innocent. I'm a phoney
And I party all the time
And I party all the time
And I party all the time
And I party all the time
