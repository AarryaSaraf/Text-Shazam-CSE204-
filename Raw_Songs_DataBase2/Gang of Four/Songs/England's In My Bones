Just like you, I was born alone
I'm like you but I'm unknown
I stand here gutted, talking to myself
England is in my bones

Windows broken at my home
Dela says there's something I stole
Bring me my bow, a bird in gold
You don't know how slow the hours go

England's in my bones
England's in my bones

I've come to the end of the road
No one taught me to think like me
Don't have no rules, make it up on my own
Don't believe any more than I see

Got nothing in my bag
Nothing I control
Just a sex-text on my phone
Bring me my spear,  unfold
God, you don't know how slow the hours go

England's in my bones
England's in my bones

England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
England's in my bones
