Where did it all begin? Where's the proof of life? Who is on my side?
Is there a blind man's guide? Can I hitch a ride when the lifeboats slide?
Don't know if what I know is true, what's the golden rule, where am I going to?
All the workers do what they do, they're applauding too, and the sky is blue

And when the true believers die, more and more get born again
If the Queen can't cope at all, there's a number she can call

What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life, a fruitfly in the beehive
I quit spinning the plates for you, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive

Where are we headed for? For a distant shore? Or some brand new war?
Don't know why I can't ask for more, don't walk out the door, what am I left here for?
How is it gonna end? Should I now repent and then make amends?
Who wrote the unwritten laws that we didn't ask for but we can't ignore?

And when the true believers die, more and more get born again
If the Queen can't cope at all, theres a number she can call

Wanting some proof of life, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life, fruitfly in the beehive
I quit spinning the plates for you, a fruitfly in the beehive
What is the proof of life? A fruitfly in the beehive
