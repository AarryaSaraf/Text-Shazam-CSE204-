Don't feel like eating, I don't wanna drink
All I need is a handkerchief to keep out the stink
Don't feel like sleeping, I don't wanna dream
All I need is a hit to cut the bullshit

Look at the cars parked in the motel
And nobody in them
They must be hungry as hell
They're feeding on ambition

Now watch this! - It's an adult movie
She's going down on him
Now hear this! - The third caller will win
Tickets to go to the wall

Don't want to lie, but I don't know what's true
All I need is to have something I can choose
Don't want to win, I'm not aiming to lose
All I need is a thought that I can use

Somebody promised some peace in sometime
It wasn't meant to be funny
I guarantee someone, somewhere,
Is taking somebody's opinions

Now watch this! - It's an adult movie
She's going down on him
Now hear this! - The third caller will win
Tickets to go to the wall
