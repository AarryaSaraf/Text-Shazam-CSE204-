He drives all week
Where does he go?
Only down one way streets
He does not know

The car's not his
Car's not his
What does he care?
Does he care?
Goes A to Zed
A to Zed
And back from there
And back from there

Parks in a mall
Hears taped birds call
They built these walls
A palace for us all
They built these walls
A palace for us all
A palace for us all
A palace for us all

Sits fountain side
To ease his mind
The passers by
Avoid his eyes

He always says
Always says
You got your health
Got your health
Shit happens, yeah
Happens, yeah
Just be yourself
Just be yourself

Delayed when he
Slowed down to see
Crash casualty
Better him than me

Crash casualty
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

He listens to
Talk radio
Strangers who
Break down on the phone

Strangers who
Break down on the phone
Down on the phone
Down on the phone

Delayed when he
Slowed down to see
Crash casualty
Better him than me

Crash casualty
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
