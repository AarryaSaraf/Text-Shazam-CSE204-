Look at me, ain't I fine
Brand new me, dig my mine
I parade myself

One on one, I am nouveau
Here I come, there I go
I parade myself

Catch my eyes, aren't we a pair
I'm not shy, touch me there
I parade myself

I win
When
I invent myself again
I parade myself
I win
When
I make myself again
I parade myself

Ain't I ripe, what a peach
Everything is in my reach
I parade myself

Now I accuse, face to face
The one to lose this one man race
I parade myself

I win
When
I invent myself again
I parade myself

I am civilized
I live wall to wall
But I ain't shy
Don't avoid my eyes
Hid some razor blades
In the wedding cake
I walk on by
Singing bye, bye, bye

I parade
I parade myself
Bye, bye, bye
I parade
