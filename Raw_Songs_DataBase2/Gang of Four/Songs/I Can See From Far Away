A face like that locked you in so that you lost all your friends

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake

How could she be your idol?
It was a fluke you first saw her
She was marooned in a shop door
But you forget how you met her

Everybody answers the bell
Everyone thinks they have no tell
Hoarding your fate, saving your skin, it never ends

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away, I can see you float away

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Oh, have Mercy

Don't ask me where she could be now
Or if her long hair is still brown
Her downy neck collects sweat beads
And if she captures the sunbeams

Everybody wants to be free
All you want is to be released
She opens her eyes, she swiveled her hips, did it all for you

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Wake.

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away, I can see you float away

Sleep. Wake. Sleep. Oh, have Mercy

I can see you float away, I can see from far away
I can see you float away
