Before we begin
I ask, please listen to me
Time destroys empires
But not empires of the heart

If it makes me happy
If it makes me happy
If it feels this good to me
I imagine what I see

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
Until the end of the night

Hold back the dawn
For dawn will break everything
Everything that matters

If it makes me happy
If it makes me happy
If it feels this good to me
In the mirror, what do I see?

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
Until the end of the night

Turn up the light
As we lie under covers
These lies are white
But in truth it's not over
