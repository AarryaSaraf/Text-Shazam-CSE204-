They live in this time and this place
He holds her close as he laughs in her face
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
When the rubber hits the road
What could go wrong?
Nothing's wrong

What they gonna get at the end?
He gets down on one knee to make amends
He's a man who desires and aspires
She's a woman who requires to be admired

"Forever starts now", she said

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
That's when for him it's gone wrong
It's gone wrong

Her compliance will pay big dividends
So he gets down on one knee to make amends
He wants to be a hero, a hero!

She sings along with his song
She thinks it's like havin' the radio on
But when her compliance is gone
She won't sing along with his song
With his song
