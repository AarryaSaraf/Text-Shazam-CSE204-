Whet the blade on the stone, light the fire from the flint
I confess to all of my crimes, tell me more and I'll repeat your lines
You're not natural, you're not as God made you, do as I say, do as I do
Before I'm burned up in the flames, I will give you all the Devil's names?

Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do!

The rod to your back I'll use 'til it's broken, you say you re innocent so you must be guilty!
You serve me ill Sir, there's nothing to find, need some face time, need some quality time
I will cleave the soul from the flesh, I am unmoved as you confess!
Look in this glass, we are the same, if we reversed then you'd be in the flames

Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do! Do as I say! Do as I do!

Please... Say as I say! Please...
Please... Say as I say! Please... Do as I say!

Burn at the stake! Die for a break!
Lose all I stake! Kill all the day!
She wore some lipstick! She should've covered it!
They dress In dayglo robes In Guantanamo!

Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you
Now I know you, I'll follow you
