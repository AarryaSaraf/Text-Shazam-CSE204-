I don't walk, I always take the car
Tune to talkshow talk about the stars
I don't speak, I got nothing to say
I'm a Capricorn anyway

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped

Fate's barcoded in my DNA
I've been living someone else's day
Doppleganger is my nemesis
Stole my luck and made my planets miss

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped

I, I don't need, I don't need to see
I could catch a green and drive blind
I could catch a green
Everything's the same, called by different names
I don't decide, I just do
Roll loaded dice, cross my fingers and trust

I hold my breath
I am turning blue
I hold my breath
I am turning blue

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
