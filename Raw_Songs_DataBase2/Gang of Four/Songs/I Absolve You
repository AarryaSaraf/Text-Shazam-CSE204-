Now, confess
Face your fears
I'm tuned in for
Your drivetime tears

Don't hold back
Share your shame
Feel the pain
You're not to blame

I forcefeed on the ruins of childhood
And lovers crimes
This showtrial
Come on down victim mic

Don't hold back
Share your shame
Feel the pain
You're not to blame

If I could
I'd let you cry on my shoulders
I've no friends either
Lonely, I absolve you

Now, confess
You're not to blame
Now, confess
You're not to blame
Not to blame
