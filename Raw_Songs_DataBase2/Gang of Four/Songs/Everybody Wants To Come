We're not moving, we're going slow
There's bodies at the side of the road

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

I'm alive, I'm not dead
I like to watch, it's better than getting head

Listen up, to hear the guns
Sex charged barrels, pump action

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

Turn the page, to see the face
The vacant eyes are staring into space

Don't need no one, I got the proof
For me to win someone else must lose

Everybody wants to come
This is what is turning us all on

The sirens fade, the traffic speeds
I am free, I'm a lover, I am real
