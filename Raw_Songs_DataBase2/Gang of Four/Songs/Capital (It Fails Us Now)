The moment I was born
I opened my eyes
I reached out
For my credit card
Oh no, I left it in my other suit!

Capital, it fails us now
Comrade let us seize the time
(I left it in my other suit!)

On the first day of my life
I opened my eyes
Guess where?
With superstars
Surrounded by luxury goods

I need a freezer,
I need a hi-fi

No credit, no goods
Call my bank, I say
They say "we're bankrupt"

Capital, it fails us now
Come out, let us seize the time
Capital, it fails us now
Comrades, let us seize the time

Capital it fails us now
(I reached out, for my credit card)
Oh no! I left it in my other suit!

One day old and I'm living on credit
One day old and I'm living on credit
(I'm selling credit, just)
One day old and I'm living on credit

( at a superstore)

One day old and I'm living on credit

One day old and I'm living on credit
