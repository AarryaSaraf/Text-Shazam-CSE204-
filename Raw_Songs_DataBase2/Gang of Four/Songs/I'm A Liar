Need to make friends
Seems I was someone else
But now I'm truly me
That's what many seem to believe
Transform yourself
Secrets take vacations
Fact and fiction are in the mixture
But you don't need a diagram to get the picture

They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must
They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must

Sold your story
But that's not what gets told
Don't waste time, don't repent
Can't pack the bags and leave
We're addicted too. On which we're weaned
Connections fail, collectives dissolve
So we invented celebrity

They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must
They said I'm a liar
'Cause no one believes when the place is on fire
Know the meaning of too much
Got the world, we do what we must
