I'm watching you step round the room
Show me the rabbit and watch me run,
When you're stripped and looking fun
You give me hope, it is a noose
Kiss and tell and don't regret,
I know that the line is dead
You're the one who asks for proof
You look good with no clothes on,
I'll take photos on my phone
I wish that I was in the loop!
You broker words like I knew you would
Feed me lies like they are food
Persuade me to jump through hoops
Disunited in a sweat, telling me to run and fetch

You're the one with the juice!
You're the one with the juice!
You think what you cannot name,
You want what you can't explain
You're the one with the juice!
You want what you can't explain,
You wish you could walk away

I wish that I was in the loop!
Dreaming that I got full house,
Never have to do without
Out of ten you are a nine
Show me the rabbit and I am fine,
Watching you walking the line
So here we are, it's closing time
I drank fast and you drank wine,
Back to your place, never mine
It's the scene of the crime, I'm off my tits!
One on one you are the chief,
Telling me what to believe
I wish that I was set loose!
Blind dates don't go like they should
Having patience, it's no good

You're the one with the juice!
You're the one with the juice!
