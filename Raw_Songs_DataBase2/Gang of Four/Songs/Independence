Like you said when we crawled down from the trees
We're in transition
I don't want to remain on the edge
We must embrace the new conditions
I'm alright, I'm alright
Through it's a contradiction
It's enough but less than I imagined
I'll get used to this
A one roomed apartment
If I fall behind with the rent
I'll have to borrow from a close friend
I'm alright, I'm alright
Through it's a contradiction
It's enough but less than I imagined
You always promise more than you can deliver
Independence ain't dependence
When you said it gets so cold that we could freeze
I reconsidered
I did all I could to be saved
It looks like I made the wrong decision
