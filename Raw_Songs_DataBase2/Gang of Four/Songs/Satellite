I wake up you are there
Silhouette against the glare
Electric skin shocks me like lightning

You say to me: I give you this 
You can have all you can kiss
If it tastes good prove it to me

Shoot me up - I'm your moon
Turn me round coming soon

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...

Lost in space, the robot writes:
Don't wanna be a satellite
Empires falling down like ninepins

Shoot me up - I'm your moon
Turn me round coming soon

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...

In your face
I can see
I can be
Anyone
I can be

I wanna be your satellite
Our words in doubt, just a sound
I wanna be your satellite
No in no out, no up or down...
