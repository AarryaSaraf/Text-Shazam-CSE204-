You work hard, you pay your dues
Play by the rules but still you lose
Stick or twist, I hold my nerve
Nobody ever gets what they deserve

All the years is a long time
But what costs the most is free (It's free)
I'm a double-jointed conman
I specialize in mimicry (Mimicry)

When I look at my life
I see how I've been used
I'll never pay back the money I spent
Never return the favours I was lent

Some have no luck with luck
But I'm a lucky man
The cards I mark are the cards I choose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

We know what it's about
All your luck has run out
Leveraged your self-doubt
Chewed you up and spat you out

We can leave the scene of the crime
We can turn back time
We can change
Yeah, we can change our minds

Some have no luck with luck
But I'm a lucky man (He's a lucky man)
The cards I mark are the cards I choose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose

Nothing's too special for you
We're here to help you through
Please say you won't refuse
But you got everything to lose

(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)
(Everything to lose)

The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
I get what I can
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
'Cause I'm a lucky man
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
But I'm an also-ran
The lucky get the luck and the longshots lose
Oh, I'm a lucky man
