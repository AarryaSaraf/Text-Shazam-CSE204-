Young producer paces to and fro
Sound of the playback fills the air
A man from EMI wears a suit and big smile
I don't hear songs, he says, just sound

Hey operator put some stuff on the line
Day in, day out, I hear the same hits
Keep yourself, free yourself from editing tape
No damn truth is cut and shaped

Young sits in the corner in the shadow
Talks to himself
Every day to all of my prayers
I take my songs to the marketplace
You can hear them shout
You can hear them shout
Lies on sale
Lies on sale
You can hear them shout
You can hear them shout
Lies on sale
