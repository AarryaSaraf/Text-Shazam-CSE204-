In time, will I
Understand it?
We can fight till it's light
Doesn't mend it
Too many times
You're my baby
Too many times we've been high
You're my baby

I wanted to manage information
Find the automatic driver
Oh, we'll find her
Ooh, but I'm still so in love
Imagine how much I'm crying
Oh, I'm crying, ooh, ooh

Do-do-do-do-do-do, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do

Too many times (Woo, woo)
You're my baby (Look)
Too many times we've been high
You're my baby
We can try all you like
But it's ending
And next time we're in paradise
You're my baby

I wanted to make a contribution, baby
I wanted to start a revolution with you
I wanted to make a contribution, baby
I wanted to start a revolution with you, oh-oh-oh

After I waited so long to find you
Why did I let myself run and hide you?
After I waited so long to find you
Why did I let myself run?

I wanted to make a contribution, baby (After I waited so long to find you)
I wanted to start a revolution with you (Why did I let myself run and hide you?)
I wanted to make a contribution, baby (After I waited so long to find you)
I wanted to start a revolution with you, oh-oh-oh (Why did I let myself run?)

Yeah, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, oh-oh-oh
After I waited so long, oh-oh-oh
Why did I let myself run? Oh-oh-oh
After I waited so long
Why did I let myself run? Oh-oh-oh
