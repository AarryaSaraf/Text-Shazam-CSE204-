// Lights On //

[Santigold:]
Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer

Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Ryan Beatty & Tyler, the Creator:]
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Car, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on

[Santigold:]
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home

[Tyler, the Creator:]
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Hurry 'cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on

Yeah, leave the lights on

// Hot Chocolate //

[Tyler, the Creator:]
It's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot (Hot), chocolate

Leche for my (Woo!) damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate

[Jerry Paper:]
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time (Cocoa, cocoa)

[Tyler, the Creator:]
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime

// Big Bag //

That's a goal
Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo

Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that

That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad (Where's my gifts?)
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want (More)
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in (Boy)
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this

Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's me

// When Gloves Come Off //

[Ryan Beatty:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
When the gloves come off, I sleep
That's when the cold begins to creep (Creep in)
I can't feel my hands

[Tyler, the Creator:]
Boom, boom, ba-boom
Go down
Back to one (Two)
Yeah
