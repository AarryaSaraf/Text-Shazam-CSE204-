Yeah
This is?
Yeah, come on, go...
Wave...

Let's go to an island
Like we did last year, catch a vibe
The dreamiest weather
Gon' do a spa and bonfires

I got rose-colored glasses
Batten your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
So last time will be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone
So far from home, but you'd never go
Said you're so free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

Cause it ain't got no waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
And just wave (wave)
Wave (wave)
Wave (wave)
Wave (wave)

Now the other way...
(Uh, okay)

Let's do some more writing
I got a couple fish then we can dine
Look, we're getting better
Aging like your favorite wine

I got rose-colored glasses
Batten your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
So last time will be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone
So far from home, but you'd never go
Said you're so free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

Cause it ain't got no waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
And just wave (wave)
Wave (wave)
Wave (wave)
Wave (wave)

Wave...

I swear that you (yeah, we're goin')
Summer's time, my favorite pursuit (yeah, we're goin')
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (yeah, we're goin')
All I need is your skin and the air
I swear to you (go babe, go babe)
Summer's time, my favorite pursuit (let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (go babe, go babe)
All I need is your skin and the air (let's go, let's go, let's go)
