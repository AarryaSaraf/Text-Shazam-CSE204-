Album: ForOnceInMyLife

// For Once In My Life //

For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

Oh baby

For once in my life

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love, I can make it
For once in my life, I have someone who need me

For once in my life
Somebody that needs me
Ooh, baby
For once in my life

// Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day //

Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful, she's so true, oh yeah,
Her dreams are tumblin', her world is crumblin' because of you, uhh uh.
One day you'll hurt her just once too much,
And when you finally lose your tender touch, hey, hey,

Baby you didn't know that thing.
You're gonna leave her once too many times and when you come back

Her feet may wander, her heart may stray, yeah, yeah
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo- Be-Doo-Da-Dee.

// You Met Your Match //

Hey you were good at playing the fox girl
When I was good you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hot for nobody
Girl just you wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown before

Cause my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Hey Baby you were playing the part with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cool Baby

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Cause my love love lights burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met you your match
When you play with my affection
You met you your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape feel off the vine

Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said you're just a baby maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better
Mama shake off that dream
I told her that you were really cooking
My love is burning for a turn at the steam

Hey, cause
My love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
You met your match
When you told me you loved me
You met your match
When you told me that you wouldn't let go

You met your match [X7]
Baby
You met your match [X7]
Baby

You met your match in me..

// I Wanna Make Her Love Me //

Hey!

I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
And I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
And I wanna make her love me till the fire don't burn
And I wanna make her love me till the world cease to turn

Oh papa, I'm like a little lost lamb
Reaching for a girl that's out of reach
Ah, sit right down and talk to me man to man
Tell me how to practice what you used to preach
Oh, papa used to tell me that a man could do
Anything he ever put his heart into

But I wanna make her love me till them seas run dry
And I wanna make her love me till money can't buy
I wanna make her love me till the fifth week in May
And I wanna make her love me till Ol' Man River runs away

Oh, she's a ditty and as pretty as Mona Lisa
Papa's rich and her mama's proud
I worked three jobs tryin' to get what might please her
But still she lives in a world where I ain't allowed
Ah papa, you used to tell me it might take a little sweat
But when a man wakes up he sure enough will get

I wanna make her love me till the kingdom come
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till right is wrong

Ah Hey, yeah Hey

Ah, I can't compete with Baby Face Pete
And I ain't no match for Lou
He gave her a diamond, a diamond ring the other week
And all I can give her is a heart so true
Oh, papa used to say a true heart will reign
What a true heart desires it sure enough will gain

But I wanna make her love me till the rock ain't stone
I wanna make her love me till the cows come home
I gonna make her love me till it snows in June
Hey, hey, save on my baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

// I'm More Than Happy (I'm Satisfied) //

She wrecked my life
Cursed my pride
Smashed my dreams
Then threw me aside oh baby yeah

Holy only blessed me when she put me down
Heaven smiled on me when you I found
You gave this life of mine a bright new chance
Now Beverly's is back to upset our plans

For each tear that she may cry
It's too late now
(To late now)
For each sweet little lullaby
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

She can beg and plead swear up what she needs
But I'll leave you never, I love you forever

You pick me up from by the wayside
Wiped the dust from my walked on pride
You are the one that patched up all my dreams
Showed me what a true heart really means

For that baby talk, she talks
It's too late now
(Too late now)
For that wiggly walk she walks
It's too late now
(Too late now)

'Cause I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I'll never never never leave my baby's side

With you I remain
She can't break the chains
That binds us together
I'll love you forever

I love you, I love you, I love you love baby

Beverly might as well go on her away
Her magic touch faded with yesterday

You're the sweetest thing under the sun
And now that I found you
I'm sure holding on

'Cause I love you baby
Really need you baby
Really want you baby
Sure ain't gonna leave you baby

And I'm more than happy girl I'm satisfied
And I more than love you girl I idolise you

('Cause I'm more than happy, girl, I'm satisfied)
'Cause I love you baby, and I need you baby
(And I never, never, never leave your side)
Ooh, don't go and I love you, sure ain't gonna leave you baby
('Cause I'm more than happy girl, I'm satisfied)
And I more than love you, said I need you baby
(And I more than love you girl, I idolize you)
Ooh, have mercy I love you

// I Don't Know Why //

I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
But I love you

Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule
I don't know why I love you 
But I love you 
Oh you never stop your 
Cheatin ways with another guy 
You laugh in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced
Cause I love you 
Oh baby, baby, baby
I don't know why I love you 
I don't know 
You and me baby, oh
I don't know why I love you baby 
But I love you baby 
Oh darlin, darlin, darlin

You throw my heart down in the dirt
You made me crawl on 
This cold black earth, baby
No I never, I never knew 
How much love could hurt
Until I loved you baby
Till I loved you baby, baby
Oh baby, I can't stop 
I can't stop crying can't you see
Here I'm pleadin on my knees
I'm on my knees
Won't you help me, help me please
Cause I love you, I love you baby
Sure enough, baby, yeah
I don't know, you don't know
We don't know none of us
Can't do nothing about it
I don't know, I don't know
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know
Nobody can do nothing about it

// Sunny //

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here,
My sunny one shines so sincere.
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all,
Now I feel ten feet tall.
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z.
My life was torn like a windblown sand,
Then a rock was formed when we held hands.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face.
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace.
You're my spark of nature's fire,
You're my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

// I'd Be A Fool Right Now //

They say your love will surely fade girl
When things go wrong and trouble calls
But they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Will never fade when darkness falls
They say that when the chips are down girl
Your love won't stay so long my friend
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Has been around through thick and thin

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside looking inside

They say your love is surely goin'
Just like a snowman in the sun
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Was here when all my friends were gone

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside lookin' inside

All my dreams would fall and crumble into dirt
If I walk away from you I'd be the one to hurt
One day my dreams were surely dying, dying, dying baby
Just like a flower without rain
They just don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Made my life blossom again
And so the story goes around baby yeah y-yeah
That this is just a passing thing
But I believe in your sweet lovin', lovin'... babe
With every summer fallin' rain

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
Oh, hey!

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
Oh, such a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
Baby, baby, a fool right now...

// Ain't No Lovin' //

Never needed a wishing well to make my happy with my baby.
Never needed a magic spell to start me thinking someday maybe.
I'll build a house of gingerbread someday,
And bring my sugar cookie home to stay 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my baby's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Oh, my Angel Love can't stop dreaming of
How it's gonna be,
It's gonna be for Angel Love and me
Goin' down to the wishing well
Cause that's where I'm gonna meet my baby

Mr Moon mixed a magic spell
He's telling me that I better hurry
To find the girl beneath the willow tree
And run and take my baby home with me 'cause

Ain't no lovin like my baby's
Ain't no lovin like my sugar's love
Ain't no lovin like my baby's

She's the girl that I am dreaming of
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (hey) Hoo, hooo
Ain't no love (ain't no love)
Ain't no love (ain't no love)

Never, never, never, never, never ha, ha
[repeat and fade]

// God Bless The Child //

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
When you're gone, spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
He just worry 'bout nothin'
Cause he's got his own

// Do I Love Her? //

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
Don't you know I do

Mrs. Jones won't you put my darling on the phone
Let me tell her
I shouldn't have left her
Cause I love her just as long as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly
Little Jack Horner in the corner loves his Christmas pie

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Let me speak to your daughter
If she gives me one more chance
I'm gonna love her like I oughta

I can't forget (I can't forget)
That lacey dress
That she used to wear for me
We'd sit under the apple tree
And I remember (I remember, I remember)
That night in September
When my baby cried and cried cause I left her side

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed
For stringing her along
Like a playboy with a play toy
And she loved me just as strong as

Bees love honey
Banks love money
Birdies love to fly (birdies love to fly)
Little Miss Muffet loves her tuffet
Babies love to cry (babies love to cry)

Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
Please don't hang up that receiver
If she heard one sweet word
She'd know I would never leave her

Baby, baby, baby
She's the best
Oh the very best
Everything worth living for
Everything that I adore

Do I love her? Do I love her?
With a heart that's true
Do I love her? Do I love her?
I swear I do

// The House On The Hill //

See that house, that house up on the hill
Let me tell you that's where my little darlin' live

Come late tonight I'll have a handful of rocks
And I know arm strength is strong enough
To make one hit the top

And if I do she'll come running out that room
(She'll come running out there)
She's gonna know that it is me, me, me, me
That's our signal, can't you see? Oh yeah, oh yeah

Oh what joy that house holds for me
That's why I stand here all night throwing rocks,
Can't you see?

Tryin' to get the attention of the girl I love
So she can be here with me under the stars above

And when I do
(When I do, when I do)
She'll come runnin' out that room
(She'll come runnin' out)
She's gonna know that it's Stevie, Stevie,
Stevie, St-St-Stevie

That's our signal, can't you see?
Oh yeah, hey hey hey

And I can see that girl runnin' down the hill
Me runnin' out to meet her, oh what a thrill
(When I see her face, moonlight in her hair)
When I see her face, moonlight in her hair

My heart beats fast because she's in my arms at last
Hey hey hey hey!

Y'all gotta see
(Y'all gotta see)
See that house, see that house up on the hill
(House up on the hill)

There's gonna be a wedding there, oh yes there will
(Oh yes there will, yeah baby)
This old arm of mine won't have to throw no more rocks

Because I'll have my cookie here with me all around the clock
(Have my cookie here)
And when I do we'll have happiness I bet you

She's gonna belong to me, me, me, me
We'll have a life of ecstasy, oh yeah, oh yeah
Just us two up on the hill
Everything's gonna be alright

Oh yeah yeah yeah

Everything's gonna be outta sight up there on the hill
Lovin', good lovin', sweet lovin', every single night
