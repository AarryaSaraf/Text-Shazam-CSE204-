// Did I Hear You Say You Love Me //

Aaah...
Did I hear you say you love me
Well baby I've got to know
'Cause if you really really love me
You've got to do things to show
Don't give me the wrong impression
By showing me warm expressions
Put me in the right direction
With tender love and affection
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside

Did I hear you say you need me
Well baby tell me the truth
'Cause if you really really need me
My sweetness here's what I'll do
Cut out all my crazy playing
'Cause for your love I have been laying
Just tell me that is what you're saying
And I'll be yours without delaying
I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside 

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Sounds so good
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you 

Did I hear you say you want me 
Now please don't give me no mess
'Cause if you really really want me
You've got to give me your best
Put my love life right in the pocket
And dare someone to try to top it
And when you think I want to drop it
Just love me 'til I beg don't stop it
'Cause I've been standing on the outside
Trying to get on the inside 

Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Well if you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
If you love me honey let me hear you say
I love you
Baby, if you love me let me hear you say
I love you
If you love me let me hear you say
I love you
And if you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you
If you want me let me hear you say
I love you
If you need me let me hear you say
I love you

// All I Do //

You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
'Cause all I do is think about you

All I do

Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
We'll I'm gonna tell you girl

And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new

And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new

I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do

// I Ain't Gonna Stand For It //

Don't wanna believe what they're telling me
Somebody's been pickin in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody by mistake
But I hear tell someone's been diggin round in my cake 

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
nah-ah (nah-ah)
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) 

Don't wanna believe what somebody said
But somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed
Don't wanna cause nobody no bodily harm
But somebody's been rubbin' on my good luck charm 

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
nah-ah (nah-ah)
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
I ain't gonna stand for it baby
nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) nah-ah (nah-ah nah-ah) 

Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my,

// As If You Read My Mind //

Close your eyes 'til the morning
Close your eyes 'til the early dew
Get inside what you've been missing
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you 

Take a chance on the secret
That you hide for beneath your dreams
Use your wildest imagination
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

Let's get high on the happy
With a toast to you and me
Love is here just for the giving
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go 

As if you read my mind
As if you touched my soul
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

// Do Like You //

[Keita] Show me how to do like you
[Aisha] If you say please
[Keita] Please

Since age one Keita knew he had the answer
And it was that someday he'd be a dancer
And with help from his sis
Surely that boy would not miss
From being the baddest dancer in the whole neighborhood
Late at night when he was supposed to be sleeping 
You could hear the pitter patter of feet creeping
To where music would play
To his sister he would say 
Before his father said hey boy get right back in that bed 

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock 

Once at school they put on a talent contest
To find out who could really boogy the best
But his mama said no
Keita's much too young to go
But his sister said please let him go so the world can see
When they saw him they said he must be crazy
Look at him he ain't nothing but a baby
But soon as he began
You knew the contest he would win
Because everyone in the audience began to cheer 

Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
Show me how to do like you
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it
- Can you rock can you rock
Show me how to do like you
Can you rock around the clock, can you rock
Show me how to do it 

[Aisha] Ooh, you done broke Mama's lamp
[Keita] Uh, uh
[Aisha] Yes you did
[Keita] No I didn't

// Cash In Your Face //

You just could not know how long we tried
To see how this building looks inside
This must be a lucky day for me
Because the sign says there's a vacancy

Look I know you came a long way
But you made it just too late
So we had to give it to somebody else
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago
And you told me that it was cool
I graduated from Howard U.
My job is paying good money too
And if you check on my resume
You'll find they all wanted me to stay 

Well I can't take the time out
To check your credit card
'Cause the computer just broke down today
Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview
But I know what you're gonna say
I know what your bottomline is 

You might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Too-oo, Too-oo too bad, 
Too-oo, too-oo too sad 

Our first child is due here any day
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay
The location is so perfect too
So please try to do what you can do 

Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed
And if you told me that I could have saved you alot of time
Well I thought the Bill was passed that said you could not discriminate
But I know some excuse you'll find
Because your bottom line is 

You might have the cash but you
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here
Aye, you might be a great doctor
You might be a great lawyer
You might possess the key to the city
Or maybe a politician 
You might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want you living in here
Say you might have the cash but you 
Can...not cash in your face
We don't want your kind living in here

// Lately //

Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye

// Happy Birthday //

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
What could fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
that they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
all throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday

We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so
