// With A Song In My Heart //

Though I know that we meet ev'ry night
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Ev'ry meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you...

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you...

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

// When You Wish Upon A Star //

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those to love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

// Smile //

Smile though your heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

// Make Someone Happy //

Make someone happy,
Make just one someone happy;
Make just one heart the heart you sing to.

One smile that cheers you,
One face that lights when it nears you,
One girl you're ev'rything to.

Fame if you win it,
Comes and goes in a minute.
Where's the real stuff in life to cling to?
Love is the answer,
Someone to love is the answer.
Once you've found her, build your world around her.

Make someone happy,
Make just one someone happy,
And you will be happy, too.

// Dream //

Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings in-n the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is thr-ou-gh
Dream and they might come true
Things are never as bad as they seem
So dream dream dream

Dream when you're feeling blue
Dream that's the thing to do
Just watch the smoke rings in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So dream when the day is through
Dream and they might come true
Things are never as bad as they seem
So dream dream dream

// Put On A Happy Face //

Gray skies are gonna clear up
Put on a happy face
Brush off the clouds and cheer up
Put on a happy face

Take off the gloomy mask of tragedy
It's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad
Ya' decide to smile!

Pick out a pleasant outlook
Stick out that noble chin
Wipe off that "full of doubt" look
Slap on a happy grin!

And spread sunshine all over the place,
Just put on a happy face!
Put on a happy face
Put on a happy face

And if you're feeling cross and bitterish
Don't sit and whine
Think of banana split and licorice
And you'll feel fine

I knew a girl so glooming
She'd never laugh or sing
She wouldn't listen to me
Now she's a mean old thing

So spread sunshine all over the place
Just put on a happy face
So, put on a happy face

// On The Sunny Side Of The Street //

Grab your coat and get your hat,
Leave your worry at the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street

Can't you hear that pitter pat
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
'Cause this rover, crossed over

If I never had a cent
I'll be as rich as Rockfeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street

With those blues on parade
Because this rover, it crossed over

If I never had a cent
I'll be as loaded as old Rockfeller
With that gold dust 'round my feet
On the sunny side of the street
On the side, at that side of the street that is sunny

// Get Happy //

Pack up your troubles and just get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Sing Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day

The sun is shinin', come on get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
We're goin' to the Promised Land

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles and just get happy
You'd better chase all your cares away
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day

We're heading 'cross the river
Wash our sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful
On the other side

Forget your troubles come on get happy
You'd better chase your cares away!!
Shout Hallelujah, come on get happy
Get ready for the judgment day

// Give Your Heart A Chance //

Spring will come to those who seek it
Love belongs to those who speak it
And in awhile you're sure to smile
If you give your heart a chance

Joy is not beyond achieving
If you're not beyond believing
True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

True faith you'll find if you look in your mind
If you only give your heart a chance

// Without A Song //

Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born, but he's no good no how
Without a song

I've got my trouble and woe, but sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along, as long as a song
Is strung in my soul

I'll never know, what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know, what makes the grass grow tall
I only know, there ain't no love at all
Without a song
