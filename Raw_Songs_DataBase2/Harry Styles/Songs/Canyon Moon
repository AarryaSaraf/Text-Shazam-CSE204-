You gotta see it to believe it
Sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it
That's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

The world's happy waiting
Doors yellow, broken, blue
I heard Jenny saying
"Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

Staring at the ceiling
Two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling
Through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

Quick pause in conversation
She plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music
Pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to
A time under the canyon moon

I'll be gone too long from you

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home

I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going
I'm going, oh I'm going home
