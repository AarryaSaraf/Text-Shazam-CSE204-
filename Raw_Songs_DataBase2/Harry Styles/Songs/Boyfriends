Boyfriends
They think you're so easy
They take you for granted
They don't know they're just misunderstanding you
You, you're back at it again

Weakened
When you get deep in
He starts secretly drinking
It gets hard to know what he's thinking
You love a fool who knows just how to get under your skin
You, you, you still open the door

You're no closer to him
Now you're halfway home
Only calling you when
Don't want to be alone
Oh, and you go
Why? You don't know

Boyfriends
Are they just pretending?
They don't tell you where it's heading
And you know the game's never ending
You, you lay with him as you stay in the daydream
You feel a fool
You're back at it again

Ooh, ooh
