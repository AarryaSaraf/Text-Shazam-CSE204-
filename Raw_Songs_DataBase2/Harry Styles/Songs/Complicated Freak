She got wrapped up in somebody else
I'm wrapped up stuck in love with myself
I never saw this coming around
But I miss her skin on me now
Tip of my tongue she's pulling my hair
I do what she wants anywhere
Back seat of the car and up in the air
But I miss how she kissed everywhere

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak

Turned up too late one too many times
Bad choice of words in my alibi
I guess I love crazy, out of your mind
You lost your head, so I'll give you mine

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak

She got wrapped up in somebody else
I'm wrapped up stuck in love with myself (Ha)

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, you complicated freak
I still crave it, complicated
Freak
