Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you

Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, feeling it out
Feeling it out

I had a few, got drunk on you and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you... (tasted)

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are in
I mess around with him
And I'm OK with it

I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you... (ride it)

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh

I had a few, got drunk on you and now I'm wasted

If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, now I can taste it
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
La la la la la
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
