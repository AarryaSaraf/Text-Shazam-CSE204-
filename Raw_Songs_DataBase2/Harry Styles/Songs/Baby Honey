Well, I think I wrote a song that all your friends are gonna like
But they'll tell you that they hate it when they don't, just because it's mine
And I swear that I'm not thinkin' 'bout you all the time
It'll only take a minute, take a listen maybe change your mind

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess you'll never know-ow

Woo!

Oh, I know he's got the money, baby honey, does he make your night?
Is it true he doesn't touch you in the place, the way I know you like?
And I swear that I'm not thinkin' 'bout you all the time
Just today, yesterday, every day, and tomorrow night

Ahh...

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you?
Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess we'll never know-ow

I swear I'm not thinkin' 'bout you now-ow (over, over over, over)
I swear I'm not thinkin' 'bout you now (over, over, over, over)

Now I'm getting older, am I getting over you
I guess we'll never know-ow
I... yeah!
