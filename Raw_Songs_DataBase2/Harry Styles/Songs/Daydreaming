Living in a daydream
She said, "Love me like you paid me"
You know, I'll be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Stay until the morning
'Cause baby, loving you's the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Living in a daydream
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
