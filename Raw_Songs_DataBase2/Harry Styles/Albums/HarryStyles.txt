// Meet Me In The Hallway //

Two, three, four

Meet me in the hallway
Meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom
Give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

I walked the streets all day
Running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway
Give me some more
Just take the pain away

Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
Gotta get better, gotta get better
Gotta get better, gotta get better
Gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

We don't talk about it
It's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it
Nothing else will do

// Sign Of The Times //

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying
It'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying
Have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here

Remember, everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying
Baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Stop your crying, baby
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away
We got to—we got to—away

// Carolina //

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

She's got a family in Carolina
So far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never saw herself as a west coaster
Moved all the way cause her grandma told her
"Townes, better swim before you drown"

She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good

She's got a book for every situation
Gets into parties without invitations
How could you ever turn her down?
There's not a drink that I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's all I think about?
Well, I guess she just found out

She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good

I met her once and wrote a song about her
I wanna scream, yeah
I wanna shout it out
And I hope she hears me now

La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la

She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
Feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good

Oh, she's a good girl
She feels so good
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

// Two Ghosts //

Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

// Sweet Creature //

Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going but we know where we belong

And ohhhh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

Sweet creature
Running through the garden, oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough

And ohhhh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard, we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home

And ohhh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn, I know

But oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You bring me home

// Only Angel //

I saw this angel
I really saw an angel

Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
Hey, hey

She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight

She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
My-my-my-my only angel

// Kiwi //

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck

She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kind of into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said, "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business
I'm having your baby, it's none of your business (it's none of your, it's none of your)
I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business
I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your, it's none of your"

It's New York, baby, always jacked up
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus
In a black dress, she's such an actress

Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kind of into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said, "I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business
I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business (it's none of your, it's none of your)
I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business
I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your, it's none of your"

She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this

It's none of your, it's none of your
"I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your)
"I'm having your baby (hey), it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your)

// Ever Since New York //

Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse. Oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?

Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
And I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Tell me something, tell me something
You don't know nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something just before you go

Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

// Woman //

Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?

(la la la la la la la)

I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen

I hope you can see, the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're making me bleed

Woman
Woman (la la la la la la la)
W-woman
Woman
Woman
Woman (la la la la la la la)
W-woman
Woman

Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this
I'm empty, I know
Promises are broken like a stitch is

I hope you can see, the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast

Woman
Woman (la la la la la la la)
W-woman
Woman
Woman
Woman (la la la la la la la)
W-woman
Woman

Woman!

// From The Dining Table //

Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry, too
But you, you never do

Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
