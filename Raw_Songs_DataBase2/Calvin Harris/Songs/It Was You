Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you're changing my way, baby
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you

One, two, three, go

It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you're changing my way, baby
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you

One, two, three, go
