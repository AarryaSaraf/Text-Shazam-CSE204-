When you hold me
There's a place I go
It's a different high
Oh no
When you touch me
I get vulnerable
In a different light
Oh no

Are you too cynical
To believe in a miracle
That just slipped through my hands
But could you take a chance for me?
Can you forgive it all
To believe in a miracle?
Yeah, I put you through hell
But I'm asking you to believe
To believe in a miracle

To believe in a miracle
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah

When you hold me
There's a place I go
It's a different high
Oh no
When you touch me (When you touch me)
I get vulnerable (I get vulnerable)
In a different light
Oh no

Are you too cynical
To believe in a miracle
That just slipped through my hands
But could you take a chance for me?
Can you forgive it all
To believe in a miracle?
Yeah, I put you through hell
But I'm asking you to believe
To believe in a miracle

To believe in a miracle
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
To believe in a miracle

Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
