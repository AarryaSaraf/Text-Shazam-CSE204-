I'm coming 'round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa


This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback


Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa


This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
