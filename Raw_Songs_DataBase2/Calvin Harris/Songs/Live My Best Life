Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
I'd like to welcome you inside
This big Snoop Dogg
Calvin Harris experience
You dig? Haha

Welcome to the place where the people have a good time
You can get yours as long I can get mine
We like to flip, trip, dip until we get right
New city, new titties, live my best life

Next flight, where should I go next?
Lookin' at my Rolex, think I need some more sex
Oh, yes, baby brought her best friends
Say she wanna go to some place that she ain't ever been
So I took her, shook her, brought her back in one piece
We walkin' on the beach, sand in between our feet
She had the best time, yes, I'm
S-N-double-O-P, you can label me the OG
Can I get a flick? Yes, just a flick or two
My whole life's new, I've been tryna get with you
Now I finally found you and I'm overwhelmed
Oh, well, keep it quiet, don't tell


Tell me how you want it, baby, I could put it down
First thing in the morning, wake you up and work you out
Livin' in the moment, enjoy while it's yours
Cold-hearted, tryna solve it with these heated floors
Feel like the world is mine for the takin'
I won't worry about what I was givin', I knew what I could make it, oh, baby
Askin' about my past life, but it's the past right
Give him somethin' to act right, and make a nigga act, uh
Favorite part is we grown, so we can do what we want
I took the world by storm and made myself at home, all good
This the G-double-O-D life
Now sit back, relax and just vibe, come on, come on


Welcome to the place where the people have a good time
You can get yours as long I can get mine
We like to flip, trip, dip until we get right
New city, new titties, live my best life
