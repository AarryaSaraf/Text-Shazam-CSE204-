Oh, oh
Everybody slow down
Everybody, everybody slow down
Everybody be on the low down
And it's cool if you wanna be slow now, no doubt
Remember that night at your old house?
Remember that time that you broke down?
Saying that you're happy, that you dropped that chain
Knowing that I'm the one to hold down

Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne, 'cause you cut other girls off
And I make it, make it, pop like soda
And you make it, make it, then dose off
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking

Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, love me, I'm right here I
I can make your lonely disappear I
I could, could you just be real?
Could you just be real?

Ain't nobody home now
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody home now
Everybody be on that night life flow
When I exit the club, so they putting on a show now, no doubt
I ain't tryna move like a dummy
I'm tryna move real so you trust me
I'm tryna show you that other people try
But it's better when you touch me

Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne and I'm missing all my phone calls
Swimming in your bed like be like
Fucking to a slow jam, I'm rocking your boat now
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking

Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, love me, I'm right here, I
I can make your lonely disappear, I
I could, could you just be real?
Could you just be real?

Could you just be real?
Real, real
Could you just be real?
Could you just be, could you just be
