Yeah. Yeah

Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night
I've been in fashion from the start
I've been unselfish with my heart
And if I've been around the world
Met a million different girls
You'd still be in with half a chance
If you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
Yeah

Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night
I've been in fashion from the start
I've been unselfish with my heart
And if I've been around the world
Met a million different girls
You'd still be in with half a chance
If you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I'll do things for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties

Yeah
