I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotions, you can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah, freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
I'm gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away in the dirt

(Ooh)
I am, I am, I am (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
