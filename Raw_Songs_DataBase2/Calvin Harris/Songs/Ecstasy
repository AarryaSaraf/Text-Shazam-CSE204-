Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
'Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
We know that we're brave enough to be

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Break through from the other side
And lead me to paradise
'Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Every time I close my eyes, we disappear

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
