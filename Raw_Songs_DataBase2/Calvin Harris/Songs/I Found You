I cannot say what I'm feeling
If I don't know how to move
I cannot say what I believe in
I finally believe in you
I travel many roads
And I know what road to choose
Now my world is never changing
There's anything I can do

'Cause I found you
I found you
'Cause I found you
I found you
'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
(I found you)

I cannot say what I'm feeling
If I don't know how to move
I cannot say what I believe in
I finally believe in you
I travel many roads
And I know what road to choose
Now my world is never changing
There's anything I can do

'Cause I found you
I found you
'Cause I found you
I found you
'Cause I found you
'Cause I found you
I found you

I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you
I found you, I found you

'Cause I found you
I found you
'Cause I found you
I found you
(I found you)
I found you
'Cause I found you
I found you
I found you
(I found you)
