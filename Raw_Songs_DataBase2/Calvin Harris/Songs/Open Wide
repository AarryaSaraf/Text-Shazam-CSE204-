Oh, God!
Whoa

Lookin' at your last text
Damn, did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it? (What)
I've been breakin' up with girls since I was fifteen
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier (Whoa)
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
Goddamn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin' I got more liquor, more ladies
More drugs and no cases with jobs and no babies
I hope no phone's taping, if so, you gon' hate me

When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is
Let me see how big your mouth is

Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me (Know it)
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off (Whoa)
On the ledge and we danglin' off (Oh)
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off (No)
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do (Uh-huh)
Body language speaks louder than verbal

And we standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses (What)
Water to champagne fountains (God)
Turn flat chests into mountains (Oh, God)
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit (I do)
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh, now)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is (Oh)
Let me see how big your mouth is

This goes out to, uh
You know who this goes out to
Ha-ha, yeah
(Hey!)
