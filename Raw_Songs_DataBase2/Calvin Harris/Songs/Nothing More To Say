Throwin' away your good loving, your time
Cat got your tongue, girl, say what's on your mind
Was this before? Oh, wait, I forgot to mention, oh
Girl, take it low, kiss it like a mistletoe

You that thang that I crave (Crave)
It's been a hell of a wonderful day (Day)
I guess I'm gettin' the things that I prayed for
Love when you have it your way (Way)
Catch your open shot and I shoot (Shoot)
What would you do if you were in my shoes? (Shoes)
Girl, I love the way that you move, ooh (Move)

We gotta get the feelin' right (Right)
The weed ain't gon' smoke itself tonight (Oh yeah)
Your troubles, I move them out the way
Until you got nothin' more to say (Oh yeah, you are)
From all that I can, and all that you are
Make me feel good, takin' me far
From all that I can, you're all that I know (Alright)

You're a hell of a woman, straight up out of dreams
When you say you love me, tell me what you mean
To havin' hope, kiss me 'til we gettin' old
Girl, take it low, blow it like a whistle, oh

You that thang that I crave (Crave)
It's been a hell of a wonderful day (Day)
I guess I'm gettin' the things that I prayed for
Love when you have it your way (Way)
Catch your open shot and I shoot (Shoot)
What would you do if you were in my shoes? (Shoes)
Girl, I love the way that you move, ooh (Move)

We gotta get the feelin' right (Right)
The weed ain't gon' smoke itself tonight (Oh yeah)
Your troubles, I move them out the way
Until you got nothin' more to say (Oh yeah, you are)
From all that I can, and all that you are
Make me feel good, takin' me far
From all that I can, you're all that I know (Yeah, oh)


Oh, fine, baby, here we go
All that I know
All that I, all that I know
All that, it hurt

Yo, watch me ride like, "Ugh"
Listen, watch me right now, na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
Your vibes like na-na-na-na-na
Watch me right now, na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na (Well, nigga, roll)
Your vibes like na-na-na-na-na
Watch me right now, na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
Your vibes like na-na-na-na-na
Watch me right now, na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
You got me feelin' like na-na-na-na-na
