Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah
Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah

The truth is an offense but not a sin!
Is he who laugh last, children! Is he who win
Is a foolish dog bark at a flying bird!
One sheep must learn, children! To respect the shepherd!

Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah
Jah live! Children yeah
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah, Jah!

Fools sayin' in their heart
Rasta your God is dead
But I and I know Jah! Jah!
Dreaded it shall be dreaded and dread

Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah
Jah live! Children yeah
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah

Let Jah a-rise!
Now that the enemies are scattered
Let Jah a-rise!
The enemies, the enemies are scattered

Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah-Jah live! Children yeah
Jah live! Children yeah
Jah-Jah live!
