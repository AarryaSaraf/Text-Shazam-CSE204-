Bend down low, let me tell you what I know now
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know
Oh! Fisherman row to reap what you sow now
Oh, tell you all I know (Ooh-oh!)
You've got to let me go now (Ooh-oh!)
And all you've got to do:
(Bend down low) Oh yeah! Let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know. Oh yeah!

You keep on knockin', but you can't come in
I get to understand you been livin' in sin
But if you love me, woman, walk right in
I've got a notch for your safety-pin
But bend down low

Keep on knockin', but you can't come in
I get to understand you been livin' in sin
But walk right in, woman, sit right down
I will keep on lovin' you; I play the clown
But bend down low, baby, let me tell you what I know
Bend down low, let me tell you what I know, yeah!
Let me tell you, baby! Let me tell you -
Knock on, babe! Just won't let you in!
You been livin' in sin. Knock on!
