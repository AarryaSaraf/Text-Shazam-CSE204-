Bado, scoobado, scoobado-bado-bado. Oh, wo-yo-yo-y!

When the whole world lets you down
And there's nowhere for you to turn
'Cause all of your best friends let you down-own-own
And you tried to accumulate
But the world is full of hate
So all of your best thoughts, just adrift through space
I know a place where we can carry on
I know a place where we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
And this people like you, ooh people like me
People need to be free yeah
There's a place in the sun where there is love for everyone
Where we can be yeah
I know a place where we can carry on
I know a place where we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on

Yeah when the whole world lets you down
And there's nowhere for you to turn
'Cause all of your best friends have a let you d-down, down-own-own
And you tried to accumulate
But the world is full of hate
So all of your best thoughts, just adrift through space
I know a place where we can carry on
I know a place where we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
We can carry on, we can carry on
