Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A yut a yook but yood no' 'nough
You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

Forget your troubles and dance
Forget your sorrows and dance
Forget your sickness and dance
Forget your weakness and dance

Cost of living gets so high
Rich and poor they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, "Oh, what a tribulation!"

Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food no' 'nough
You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

A belly full, but them hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A hungry man is a angry man
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A hungry mob is a angry mob
