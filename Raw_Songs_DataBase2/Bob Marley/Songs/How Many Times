How many times I told you (I love you)?
But now you want to say that (we are through)
What a more, can I do?
What more can I say to you?
Now you're gone

Do you remember that first (night we met)?
That was a moment I (never will forget)
Love was at first sight
You came walking through the pale, pale moonlight
(Pale, pale moonlight)

Do you remember that first (night we met)?
That was a moment I'll (never will forget)
Love was at your first sight, wa-da-da
You came walking, through the p-p-pale, p-p-pale, pale moonlight
(Pale, pale moonlight)
