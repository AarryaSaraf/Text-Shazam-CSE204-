Oh-a-w-oh
When I was just a little child
(Little child)
Happiness was there awhile
(There awhile)
And from me, it
It slipped one day (ay)
Happiness
Come back I say

'Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking
For happiness

Well if you don't come
I've got to go looking
God, for happiness... happiness

Say that
Say I'm hurting
(Inside) and it's no
I'm hurting
I'm hurting
Deep inside

Oh good God now

Oh hear my cry
Hear my cry
Yeah my my my my my my my cry

Been together like school children
(School children)
Then you hurt me just in vain
(Just in vain)
Oh
Lord, I'm your little child
(Little child)
Oh
Happiness come back awhile

'Cause if you don't come
I'm going a looking
For happiness
The road is dangerous

'Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking
For happiness...happiness

Said I'm
Don't you know I'm
I'm hurting, hurting inside

Oh I'm hurting

Who cares
Who cares

Does the one who love
Oh
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

Does the one who love
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

(Been together)
Been together like school children
