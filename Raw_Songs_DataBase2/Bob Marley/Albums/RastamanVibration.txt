// Johnny Was //

The unity must have to start now
Because I mean, how long would we have to suffer?
Let us learn these things that we must be united

That's right
Truly, we're involved in a struggle
So what we going to do?
We got to make it right for our people
For our forefathers and mothers
That's right (must be united)
For the seeds (must be united)
Spiritual warriors (must be united)

Woman hold her head and cried
Because her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cried
Explaining to her was a passer by who
Saw the woman cry
Wondering
How can she work it out (how can she work it out)
Now she knows not the wager of turning them
Her gift of love is life
She cried

Oh um mm how
Johnny was a good man
How
Johnny was a good good good good good good good
Good good good good good good man
Johnny was a good man
She cried
She cried

Any attempt to change my stance son, would be futile
Ma, things for you would never get easier ooooow child
Supreme the colour scheme
Why brothers die with dirty cream
They avoid their dreams
But they obtained by worthy beings
Homicide statistics, obituary columns
Numerous things listed
Different violent types of behavior depicted
They murdered my brethren
He was a good man
Protected his fam, we all respected this man
Still his life got held up like liquor stores
Or old school jams
What goes around re-surfaces
Now is it worth it kid?
Do you really wanna get out the game?
I know you nervous kid
Hot and caught up
Like my boy Bokeem in the flick
Plus we know reality is much more worse and much more sick
Your cerebral eye probe vocals, can't touch your ear-lobes
Destroying all microbes
The ill-dynamic psycho
Analyst, so understand it this
Beautiful world as we know it, is definitely at risk
Righteous soldiers professed to be triumphant at battle
Loud cries from the cell, many cages rattle
Fire radiates heat, ice radiates cold
I radiate thoughts and ideas all things within my control
Some men travel down twisted roads
And innocent lives get lost
May Ja, bless his soul

Johnny was a good man
How
Never did a thing wrong
How
Johnny was a good man
Kinda woman's tender care, keep crying
These two was the child she bare
Oh, a woman's tender care
Seem to all the child she bare
Woman cry just like I am there

Word is bond he was a good man
So is my man BIG
Rest in peace BIG
So is my man Pac
Rest in peace Pac (Rest in peace Pac)
So was so many other brothers
Too numerous to mention (To numerous to mention)
Time is now (Time is now)
For us to fight for what is ours, rightfully
As was prophesied from the beginning
So shall it be (So shall it be)

// Cry To Me //

(Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo! Ooh-ooh hoo-hoo!)
Cry to me, now
You gonna cry to me, yeah!
You're gonna walk back through the heartaches
You're gonna walk back through the pain

// Night Shift //

The sun shall not smite I by day
Nor the moon by night
And everything that I do
Shall be upfull and right
And if it's all night
It got to be all right!
If it's all night
Got to be all right!

Your mamma won't lose this one
You're the lucky one under the sun
If you make me move
Then you know you got the groove
All night, it's all right!
All night, yeah! It's all right!

Working on a forklift
In the night shift
Working on a night shift
With the forklift
From A.M. (Did you say that? Why did you say that?)
To P.M. (Working all night!)
Working on a night shift, yeah!
(Did you say that? Why did you say that? Upfull and right!)
Well, if it's (all night!) - if it's (all right!)
All night (all night!) -

Warehouse (all right!)
You're empty, yeah!
Go around the corner
Bring your goods!
Go around the other corner
Bring your suitcases. (All night!)
By the sweat of my brow, (All right!)
Eat your bread! (All night!)
By the sweat of my brow, (All right!)
Eat your bread!

All night (all night)! All right (all right)!
All night (all night)! All right (all right)!
Oh, yeah! (moon by night)
Why did you say that? Oh, yeah! (Upfull and right!)
Working on a night shift
With the forklift. (Moon by night!)
Working on the night shift
Oh, yeah! (Upfull and right!)

// Rat Race //

Uh! Ya too rude!
Uh! Eh! Oh what a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
Oh, what a rat race!
This is the rat race! Rat race! (Rat race!)

Some a lawful, some a bastard, some a jacket
Oh, what a rat race, yeah! Rat race!

Some a gorgon-a, some a hooligan-a, some a guine-gog-a
In this sphere rat race, yeah!
Rat race!
I'm singing that
When the cat's away
The mice will play
Political violence fill ya city, ye-ah!
Don't involve Rasta in your say say
Rasta don't work for no C.I.A.
Rat race, rat race, rat race! Rat race, I'm saying
When you think is peace and safety
A sudden destruction
Collective security for surety, ye-ah!

Don't forget your history
Know your destiny
In the abundance of water
The fool is thirsty
Rat race, rat race, rat race!

Rat race!
Oh, it's a disgrace
To see the human-race
In a rat race, rat race!
You got the horse race
You got the dog race
You got the human-race
But this is a rat race, rat race!
