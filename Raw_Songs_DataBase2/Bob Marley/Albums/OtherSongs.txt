// Bass Is Heavy //

Bass is heavy, drummer is steady
In this situation we need some kinda protection
So don't get panicky and run in the wrong direction
Jah made man to rule his destiny
The sacred values of the law of humanity

The tension builds, the energy grow
Riddim runs and I got you on the floor
Cryin out for more
Cause that's the only way we gonna know for sure
You need some more
So, free your souls and let your spirit go
Wherever you go

We're having a real good time
We're having now real good time
Real good time

Tension builds, the energy grow
Riddim runs and I got you on the floor
Cryin out for more
Cause that's the only way we gonna know for sure
You need some more
So free yourself and let your feelings grow
Wherever you go
Cause that's the only way we gonna know for sure

The tension builds, the energy grow
In this situation we need some kinda protection
Don't get panicky and run in a wrong direction
Jah made man, yes to rule his destiny

// Treat You Right //

You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, then you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat me right, treat me right, open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light

Do you think I'm a fool, well you'd better think twice
I've had enough, baby, it's time you realize
That you can't have it both ways, that's no way to live
You've done all the takin', it's your turn to give

One of these days you're gonna reach out and find
The one that you count on has left you behind
Don't wanna be no mother, you know I'm no saint
Oh my, my baby, before it's too late

Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

You want me to leave, you want me to stay
You ask me to come back, you turn and walk away
You wanna be lovers, then you wanna be friends
I'm losin' my patience, you're nearin' the end

Treat me right, treat me right
Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light, oh, treat me right

Treat me right, treat me right
Treat me right, treat me right
