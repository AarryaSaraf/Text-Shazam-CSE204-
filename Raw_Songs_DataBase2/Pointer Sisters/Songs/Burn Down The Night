Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came
And they tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the tenth, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said, "Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert. E. Lee"
Now, I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if my money's no good
You take what you need and you leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother up above me
Who took a rebels stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
And I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
The night they drove Old Dixie down
When all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And all the people were singin', they went, na na na
The night they drove Old Dixie down
When all her bells were ringing
The night they drove Old Dixie down
And you could hear 'em all singin', they went, na na na
