When the morning comes
I find myself just missing you
I find myself just wishing you were
Laying by my side

As the day goes on
I'm wondering if you're missing me
I'm wondering if you're wishing we were
Laying side by side

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I'll get the message loud and clear

Let yourself come home
Forget the others, bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs

When my evening comes
I'm wishing I was kissing you
I'm fishing for the words to lay on you
To make it right, make it right

Let me know if you
Feel the way I do
I'll get the message loud and clear

Let yourself come home
Forget the others, bring it
Here is where your love belongs
Here is where your love belongs
