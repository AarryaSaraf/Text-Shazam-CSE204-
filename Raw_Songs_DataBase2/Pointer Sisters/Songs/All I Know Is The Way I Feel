All I know is the way I feel
Anything that makes me feel so good
Just got to be
I can' help myself, it's the way I feel
It's scarin' me to death to think
What you could do to me
You're the one that I've been searching for
You were so hard to find
When you're near I need nothing more
You're so deep inside my heart
My soul and my mind
Lost in space is the way I feel
You got me sailin' way beyond
My wildest dreams
When we're lyin' here soft and warm
All the world is turnin' slow
Nothin' ever came so easy
Wonder just how far, how long
And where it will go
All I know is the way I feel
Nothin' in my life ever was so real
I know I said it a million times
And it always will be true
All I know is the way I feel
All I need to do is to
Keep on lovin' you
All I know is the way I feel
You got me goin' round in circles like
A spinning wheel
I can't help myself, it's got to be
It's scarin' me to death to think
What you could do to me
All I know is the way I feel
Nothin' in my life ever was so real
