Easy days, when we can just relax
Easy days, that's when love can make you feel
That life is for real
We're just dreamin' and hopin' that someday soon

We'll have those easy days when we can lay around
And let the children play
And let choirs of angel sing our love to the world

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

When the sky's blue above and you're happy
Dreamin' of who you love but you only
Make believe he is near
There so much for you to see, do and go here
So relax your mind I'm sure you'll find

Without a worry or care
And your thoughts are as clear as the air
There's so much to share

Easy days, sitting there all alone
Easy days, no one rings a telephone
They think you're not home
And you're glad that they could not get through it
And give you just one maybe two of those easy days
