We could be so hot together, hot together
We could be so hot together, together

We happened to be at the same party
We left it up to chance
I'm remembering the time you kissed me
Now you're asking me to dance
They way we moved with each other
We could dance this dance forever


We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good

You led me through the crowded room
And out into the night
You kissed me like you did before
In the quiet of the moonlight
We're wondering if the other's alone
And thinking about taking it home


We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good

We could be so hot together, hot together
We could be so hot together, together
The way we moved with each other
We could dance this dance forever


We could be so hot, hot together
Hot, so hot together
Wherever else you get down
You've got to free it up
We could be so hot, hot together
So hot together
We both know that it could feel good, so good
