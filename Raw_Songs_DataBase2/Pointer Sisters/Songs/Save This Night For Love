Save this night for love- just me and you
When the darkness falls
We'll melt into the shadows of our fantasies
And leave them dancing on the wall

Make this night the one that never ends
And all we're dreaming of
Tracing every moment for remembering
In colors made from shades of love

Save this night for love
(Have ya ever been to heaven, baby)
Save this night for love
(We're gonna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

Save this night for love- let no one in
We'll take it on our own
And with our bodies pressing hard and closing in
We'll hang on 'til we can't go on

Save this night for love
(Can you feel the magic, baby)
Save this night for love
(We're gonna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

I can't hide what I'm feelin'
Wanna let it go all the way
Your love is the reason
And I can't enough of your touch and your taste

Save this night for love- and let it sing
In echoes with no end
We'll take it further, baby, sharing everything
Go back and do it all again

Save this night for love
(Let's go to heaven, baby)
Save this night for love
(I wanna be there)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)

Save this night for love
(I feel the magic, baby)
Save this night for love
(Late in the midnight hour)
Save this night for love
(Oh, won't you save it for me)
