Walking down the road this morning,
The sun is in my eyes.
The smell of the sweet sweet blossoms
Steps right thru my mind.
And I say

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?

Passing by familiar houses;
I was getting on close to home,
I could tell by that special feeling,
That was gong down to my soul.
And I say:

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?

The river was rolling
Gently on it's way.
Sweet little children
Coming out to play.

And it made me feel so happy!
I didn't know what to say, except:
Thank You! for this life I'm living
And the songs I sing today,
And I say:

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
