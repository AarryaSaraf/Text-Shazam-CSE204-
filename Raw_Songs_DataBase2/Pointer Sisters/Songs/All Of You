If you hold my love up to the light
And you see everything that can be yours tonight
Would you lay your heart out on the line
And give me anything that my heart can find

But don't ever stop believing
You won't end up breaking even

I don't want everything you have
I don't want everything that's true
I don't want everything
Just give me, just give me all of you

I don't want everything you have
I don't want everything that's true
I don't want everything
Just give me, just give me all of you

If you make a promise in the dark,
Could you make it to anyone?
Could you make it from the heart?
Well, I'm not just anyone, baby
And you better know for sure
That if you want all of me, it might take something more

But don't ever stop believing
You won't end up breaking even





Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you

Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you

Don't want it
Can't you see that?
Don't need it
Just give me your sweet, sweet love
Just give me, just give me all of you
