Stayin' up all night my heart won't stop
There's a fire in me to feed
I can't touch you baby
All you've got to do is beam it into me
So won't you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won't you telegraph your lovin'
That's what I need

Send your kisses here, send them through the air
My heart's ready to receive
Please don't stop no baby don't let up
You got the open line to me
So won't you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won't you telegraph your lovin'
That's what I need

Telegraph your lovin'
I just want to love you baby
Won't you telegraph your lovin'
That's what I need

Sweet, sweet kisses here, comin' through the air
Fire raging in me
Feel you coming in so loud and clear
No I don't ever want you to leave
So don't you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won't you telegraph your lovin'
That's what I need
