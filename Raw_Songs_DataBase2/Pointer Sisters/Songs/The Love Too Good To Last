Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinking about you
Here comes the rain
I don't know how to explain to you
What it feels like living without you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had The Love Too Good To Last
It burned too hot too fast
Too good to last
The best of love gone bad
Ain't it a shame

No one's to blame
What if I swear in the name of you
Could you see I need to be with you
Won't you come back
Feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you

Isn't it sad
When you think we had The Love Too Good To Last
It burned too hot too fast
Too good to last
The best of love gone bad
Ain't it a shame

No one's to blame
(No one)
What if I swear in the name of you
(What if I swear)
Could you see I need to be with you

Won't you come back
(I need you, I need you)
Feeling the hurt from the lack of you
Could we save this love too good to last
(Oh, hey)

Here comes the night
If I could be in the light of you
I would not be thinking and thinking about you

Won't you come back
I'm feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you
(Wanna give you, Wanna give you, Oh)

Won't you come back
(Won't you come back)
I'm feeling the hurt from the lack of you
There's so much I still wanna give you
(Wanna give you, Wanna give you, Oh)
