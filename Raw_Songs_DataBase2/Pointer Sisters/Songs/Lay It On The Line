Boy, you've got something special
That keeps me coming back for more
I'll be your slave, don't make me your fool
It's time that I knew the score
I know your mama done told you
That I'm not that kind of girl
But I'm old enough to know what I want
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

You know you got me rocking and reeling
And tossin' in my sleep
I really need you
Only want to please you
For each and every day, now
And your friends try to tell you
That I'm not good enough for you
But you know my point of view
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

Lay it, lay it on the line
Come on and lay it, lay it on the line

You can follow smiling faces
They will take you to many places
But you'll never find another love like mine
So think before you close the door
Your friends try to tell you
That I'm not good enough for you
But I'm old enough to know what I want
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line
