Down on my luck
Love don't come around much more
Sure seems funny
I've been down the road before
I walk these streets
Lookin' for some kinda sign
All things change in time
I wanna believe

That we have got to find love
Yeah, find love
We have got to find love, find love

If we just hold on
I know the best is yet to come
We've got to hold on
There is a heart for everyone

We have got to find love
Ooh, find love
We have got to find love, find love

The sun just won't shine
I need to see things brighter
Your love could build a fire
And warm my soul
But I ain't givin' up, no, no, no
Though I never was a fighter
Lord, my load could be so much lighter
So much lighter

And we have got to find love
Yeah, find love
We have got to find love, find love

If we just hold on
I know the best is yet to come
We've got to hold on
There is a heart for everyone

We have got to find love
We've got to find love
We have got to find love
We've got to find love

We have got to find love
We've got to find love
(We have got to find love)
We've got to come together
(Find love)
We've got to come together

(We have got to)
Whoo-ooh-ooh, find love
Why won't we find love
We have got to find love
We have got to, we have got to
(Find love)
We have got to find love...
