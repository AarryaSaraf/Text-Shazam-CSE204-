Got to really get it goin'
That's the only way of knowin'
Make it worth all that we're doin'
We must take it all the way

Followed plans that we perfected
Get results so unexpected
Learn your lessons and accept it
You will find a better way

Trust your heart
Hold onto your dreams and don't let go
Trust your heart

It will never let you down
It will never let you down

We're gonna make it
Yeah we're gonna make it through

Pleasin' yourself is better than pleasin' someone else
It won't be easy for you
It won't be easy for me
Don't stop or you will never know

We're gonna keep on pushin' till it all comes through
Think about what you wanna do
We're gonna make it
Yeah we're gonna make it through

Don't waste your time
You got to get in line
Don't waste your time

No one leaves here without stayin'
In this game of life we're playin'
Got to take a lot of chances
Broken hearts and hot romance

Nothing will be here forever
What is here we can make better
Everything is for a reason
You can do it your way



We're gonna make it
