How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of late night romance
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

Oh, nobody's going to be there
Oh, so don't you want to go where
we could dance across the sky and leave the world behind us
Nothing that we couldn't do
Yeah, we could dance across the sky and leave the world behind us
Just the moon and me and you
Just the moon and me and you

We could hide inside the rhythm 'til the morning finds us
Share a little ecstasy 
Yeah, we could hide inside the rhythm 'til the morning finds us
If you come away with me
I'll show you how it feels to be
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

Oh, we're going to sail on the wind
Oh, so don't you want to begin?

Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing

How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
underneath the starry sky
How 'bout a little bit, a little bit of moonlight dancing
Just the moon and you and I
Just the moon and you and I
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing
Moonlight dancing
