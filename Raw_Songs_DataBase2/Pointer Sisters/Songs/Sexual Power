He's the master of persuasion
He's so hot to be so cool
And he shatters my defenses
When he walks into the room
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
I can feel his magnetism
He's seducing me again
I can feel his magnetism
He's seducing me again
He consumes me with emotions
And I'm falling deep with
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
Come to me, I hear him calling
Come to me
Helplessly, I feel myself fallin'
Come to me, come to me
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
He controls the deepest part of me
He fulfills my every fantasy
Overcome by sweet temptation
There's no resisting him
So I release my inhibitions
And surrender once again
He possesses me with sexual power
He possesses me with sexual power
