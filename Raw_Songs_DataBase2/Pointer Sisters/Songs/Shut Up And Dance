Hey you, you wanna dance?

All I want to do with you is dance
I don't need no verbal expose
Hey

I wanna dance, that's all I want
Ride on that rhythm flowin'
Take the train where it's going so fast
And don't look back

Just met not long ago
Music was steady jammin'
You're out there body slammin' so hard
Then came a rap

Ohh, I ain't come here to lookin' for no converstion
(I ain't lookin' for no conversation)
And I ain't searchin' for my, for my romeo
(I ain't searchin' for my romeo)

Don't ask me nothin', don't tell me nothin'
Don't talk about romance
Just wanna move, jam on the groove
All you gotta do is shut up and dance
(Shut up and dance)
Yea, yea, yeah

Ohh, all I want to do with you is groove
(All I wanna do with you is groove)
I don't need no verbal expose
(I don't need no verbal expose)

Just let me dance, that's all I want
Ride on that rhythm flowin'
Take the train where it's going so fast
And don't look back, Jack

Don't ask me nothin', don't tell me nothin'
Don't talk about romance
Just wanna move, jam on the groove
All you gotta do is shut up and dance
(Shut up and dance)
Yea, yea, yeah

It's hard to be groovin'
When your mouth always movin'
The strangest thing I've ever seen
It's tough to be rockin'
When your rocker talkin' now
Do you know what I mean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean-ean?

Play it for me one time
Uh!
Yea, yea, yeah

There's one thing that bothers me
You don't get a second change
It's a big mistake tryin' to rap to me
While I'm on the beat, just shut up and dance (dance)
Yea, yea, yeah
Hey

Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance, romance
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance, romance

Shut up!
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance
Shut up!
Shut up, shut up and dance, and dance
Don't talk, don't talk romance
Shut up, uh!

Uh! Uh!

Shut up! (Shut up)
Shut up! (And dance)
Shut up! (Don't talk)
Shut up! (Romance)
Shut up!
