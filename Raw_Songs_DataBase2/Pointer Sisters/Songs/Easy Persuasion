You don't have to tell me
What you say with your eyes
What I want to hear is
There's more here tonight

I know I can't be sure
You're not mine, I'm not yours
But my heart needs to believe
More than it wants to see sometimes

And if I run from you
I'll miss the best of you

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And be with me tonight

You don't have to spell out
Each letter to me
One word, one whisper, one sweet invitation
Is all that I need

Something that I can feel
Some traction for my wheels
Oh my heart needs to believe
More than it wants to see sometimes

Don't let me run from you
I'll miss the best of you

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And it will be alright

Easy persuasion
All I need tonight
Just tell me you love me
And be with me tonight

I need some easy persuasion
To take me through the night
Just tell me you love me
And it will be alright
