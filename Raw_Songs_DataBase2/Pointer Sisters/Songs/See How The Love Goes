I can hear somebody knockin'
At my bedroom door
I find it rather shockin'
It's my best friend's guy

Imagine my surprise
There's a hungry look in his eyes

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

He said, "I'm feelin' kinda lonely
And only you will do
Would you like to get to know me
Like I wanna know you"

No tellin' what a girl would do
Face to face with somebody like you

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?
Oh yeah, see how the love goes

I can hear him calling
That no one understands him
He is beggin' me to let him in
And he's waiting for my answer

Should I open up the door
And let trouble walk in?
Should I resist him even more
Or tell him, come on in?

No tellin' what this girl would do
Face to face with somebody like you

See how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here know how the love goes?

Oh yeah, see how the love goes
Anybody here
