I found a letter to her
I guess you're thinking of leaving
But if your love hasn't died
If there's a spark to revive
Think about it before you leave
Don't make a hasty decision
There's so much we stand to lose
And honey I can't envision

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, baby, how should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights after you?

Don't be a stranger to me
Just tell me what we are missing
Something's still keeping you here
You're torn in two, but to me it's so clear

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, baby, why should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights?

Ooh, after you, ooh
Is there something I have done wrong?
Tell me, boy, don't just move on

After you there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, honey, why should I survive?
How will I stand lonely nights after you?
(After you) After you, baby
Oh, I'm all but through
Listen, baby, just walk in my shoes (Walk)
Feel my heart breaking in two
After you, oh, there's no one
After you I'm all but through
Tell me, honey, why should I survive?
How will I stand the lonely days and nights?
After you, oh, there's no one (No one)
After you I'm all but through
