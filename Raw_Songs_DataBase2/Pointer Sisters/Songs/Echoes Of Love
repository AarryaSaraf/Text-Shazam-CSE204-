I hear your voice everywhere
Echoes of love

Making me look back
Over my shoulder
Echoes of love are starting all over
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
They're out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Darling since you went away
I think about you every day
So-oh many memories
About to get the best of me

Recalling the time
I used to hold you
I just wouldn't do what I was supposed to
I've done things I'd like to undo
But darling it's you I'd like to run to

Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
They're out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Darling since you went away
I think about you every day
So-oh many memories
About to get the best of me.

Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
