I've never believed in smooth sailing
After every high waits a storm
We've both been out in the cold before
to come back and make each other warm

Please spare me monotony
And surprise me with each day


I want fireworks
I want the whole shebang
Come on and kiss me
like the first time
Over and over again
Strike me with cold, blue lightning
Make me tremble like a quake
Oh hold me, baby, tighter
Don't worry, I won't break

I know there's no love without crying
Good and bad live door to door
We both have stepped on each other's heart
But God knows our love is getting more

Please spare me monotony
And surprise me with each day



I am addicted to dangerous fire
when sparks are flying
Blood rushing faster,
the whole world is spinning
and love's worth dying for
