Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me

In my mind I'm consumed
And my body wants it just to last
Got one eye full of you
Feel my willpower going fast
Don't stop
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me
What you want I can do
Any questions you got in your head
Let my hands speak the truth
Tell you things I bet you never dreamt
Don't stop me

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, you just turn me on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Keep it up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me come alive
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, you make me feel so right
I know just what you like

There no noise and no phone
Just a rumble coming from this bed
Love your skin on my bones
And my lips to turn to cherry red
Don't stop
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me, uh
Don't stop me, uh, don't stop me
Got your paint on my brush
Any picture that you want we'll make
You say, ooh, and I say hush
Keep your fingers dancing on my legs
Don't stop

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, keep my my mind turned on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Let's stay up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me come alive
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, you just drive me wild
I know just what you like

Gonna get you to me tonight
Gonna get you to me
Gonna get you to me tonight
Gonna get you to me

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

No, I can't get enough
Go on and make me holler for more
No, I don't know enough
When to stop asking for more
Make me live for your touch
Come and find it, come and find it

Do you like it, do you like it
Ooh, I want your mind, ooh, you're so divine

Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Ooh, you just turn me on
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Let's stay up all night, baby
Gonna be mercury rising tonight
Honey, you make me burn inside
Mercury rising tonight
Baby, it's the night in me, yeah
I know just what you like
Gonna get you to me tonight...
