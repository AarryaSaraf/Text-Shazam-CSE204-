Hot lights on the street
Slow groove I feel the heat
Deep inside a summer night, hypnotized
I saw his face, out in the crowd
I felt no shame starring so loud
Just for a instant and to my surprise
There was a vision of a future in his eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
They say desire is on your mind, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
Only a mirror of what's inside, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
And I know that I can trust
My heart and body and soul
To your eyes

Show me paradise
I've seen what it was like
Heaven knows it's gonna be ecstasy
The way we stared, broke every rule
Our souls were bared, melting love-cool
Instant attraction I was mesmerized
Held by the promise of pleasure in his eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
They say desire is on your mind, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
Only a mirror of what's inside, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
And I know that I can trust
My heart and body

They read me, they groove me
Have power to move me, I know, yeah
The magic, the wonder
The spell that I'm under in your
With your eyes

Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Desire is hard to hide, but, baby
No, baby, eyes can't hide
No sense in even trying, eyes
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
You can't hide of what you feel inside
No, no, no, baby
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Your eyes set me on fire, baby
Oh, baby, eyes don't lie
Ooh, you got me mesmerized
With your eyes
