You were headed in another direction
And then you saw me
I knew that
You were ready for the connection
And I could feel your desire

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Don't leave me now
I can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind

I got a notion
You know just how to move me all over
I'm caught in a motion
Like I've never been here before

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Don't leave me now
Can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind

I couldn't think of anything better
I couldn't leave it alone
Don't know how I'll ever resist you
I really want to go on

Slow down
I think you're scaring me
You're really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on don't leave me now
Can't let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You're just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she'd never done
Operator, motivator
You're one of a kind
