My bags are packed and set by the door
Just waitin' for the time to go
No matter what you had to do
You could find a way to let me know

That's it, I've had enough
It's been too tough
I'm leavin' with the mornin' sun, yeah
I've never given you a reason why
To treat me like you do

So I'm tellin' you now, bye
I'm hurt that you didn't try
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh

We had a talk just last week
And I thought I made it pretty clear
Things had to change before too long
Or this love affair would disappear

But that's it, I've had enough
It's been too tough
Sorry, but I've gotta run, oh...
My heart seems to be breakin' inside
I've gotta go before I change my mind

So I'm tellin' you now, bye
I'm hurt that you didn't try
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Don't wanna talk about it, baby)
Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Ooh!)

Maybe you finally believe
What I've been tellin' you
It takes more than just talking
You've got to do something new

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh

Uh-uh
Uh-uh

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Baby)

Uh-uh, whoo!

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh
(I can't take no more, baby, please)

Because you actin' the way you do
I can't stay here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Gotta get away, yeah)
'Cause you keep actin' the way you do
I won't be here lovin' you, uh-uh
(Whoo-whoo, I know, yeah)

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Goodbye, away
I'm outta here
