Someone gave me a rainbow tonight,
and I'm living my daydream
Someone gave me a handful of light
Someone's pulling my heartstrings

It came to me in a minute
Passage of time won't diminish
Now I'm shivering inside
You touch me and oh
I just let it go


Tell it tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
I could have told you from the start
You would be my only one

Not my usual state of mind
There is no indecision
Come on, baby, we'll just take our time
What we don't know we'll just fill in

Each word you say got me spinning
You're in my life, now I'm winning
And I'm trembling inside
You touch me and oh
I just let it go



And I can't help it, baby
You make me feel
like I don't want to wake up without you
Can't believe that I fell in love in a minute
(love in a minute)
And now that I'm in it
(now that I'm in it)
Deep down
(Deep down)
In it with you



Live a little bit
Love a little bit
I need a little bit, my only one

Live a little bit
Love a little bit
I need a little bit, my only one
