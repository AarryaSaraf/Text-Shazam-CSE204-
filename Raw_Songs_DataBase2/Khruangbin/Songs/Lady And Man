You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
