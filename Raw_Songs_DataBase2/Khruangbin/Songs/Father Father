Forgive me, Father
For all your grace

Father, Father
Look at these works that I've done
I present them to you
In hopes to get your attention

Father, Father
Look at the mess that I made
Just a man with unclean hands
From you I hide my face

Father, Father
The guilt's cutting through like blades
Just a man with unclean hands
From you I hide my face

My Son
My Love is always here for you
You don't' have to
Climb a ladder
Bend over backwards
To gain my love for you
Cause
If you forgot
I am love
From the bottom to the top
My love steadfast and never stops
Continue on
And it never slows down

I know I know
The weight of your sin
Is heavier than a thousand tons
But my son Jesus
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the damage that you done
He absorbs the future and present one
Oh yeah

Oooo
