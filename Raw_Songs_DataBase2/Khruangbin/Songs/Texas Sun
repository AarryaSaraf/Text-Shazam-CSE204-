You say you like the wind
Blowing through your hair
Come on, roll with me till the sun goes down
Texas sun

Say you wanna hit the highway
While the engine roars
Well come on, roll with me till the sun goes down
That Texas sun
Oh yeah

Texas sun

Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Come on, roll with me til the sun dips low
Texas sun

Texas sun, oh girl
The Texas sun

When I'm far from home
And them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me nice and you keep me warm
Wanna feel you on me
Can't wait to get back there again
Texas sun

Texas sun
Texas sun
Texas sun

You say you like the wind
Blowing through your hair
Well come on, roll with me til the sun goes down
Texas sun
Texas sun

Ooh, baby, you're so gorgeous
How about you and me take a lil trip
In the big body?

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Oh, girl

Take a ride with me, babe
You by my side
How does it sound?
You and I
Baby, oh I know

Take a ride with me baby
You by my side
How does it sound
You and I
