From sand and stone
Level and true
I built my house
On shifting sands
By my hands
A realm on Earth
And from the date
A giant palm
A golden shield
For every man
In time before
We couldn't stand
We're the first

And my throne
Is your throne
And the rings
On my hand
Are your gold
And my sun
Is your sun
To the end
And my bones
Are your bones
From the grain
To the sand
To the stone

The crushing wind
The serpent's tooth
Bring me in
The shifting sands
From my hands
It fell to the ground
A rotten date
Seen in the palm
The golden shield
It weighed us down
A sunken tomb
A phantom town
We're the last

And my throne
Is your throne
And the rings
On my hand
Are your gold
And my sun
Is your sun
To the end
And my bones
Are your bones
From the grain
To the sand
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
