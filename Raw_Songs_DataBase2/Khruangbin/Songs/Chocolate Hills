I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
Just stay forever
It feels like heaven
When I'm kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

Baby let's go
Slide out
To a place no one knows
Are we dreaming, are we not?
Who cares?
Let's get lost in the flow

I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
This day forever
This day forever
It feels like heaven
Woah
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

Baby put down
Your pride
No need to have fear
I will take care of you
Lay down
Just be with me here

I love the way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
It's now or never
It feels like heaven
Woah
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored
Kissin' on your rose colored lips

The way we spend the time
Running through your fields
The way we play
In your chocolate hills
Please stay forever
Please stay forever
It feels like heaven
When I'm kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose
Kissin' on your rose colored lips
