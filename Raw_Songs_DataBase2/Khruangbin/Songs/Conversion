Your love poured into my heart
Your love poured into my heart
Your love poured into my heart
Like the water that flows from the pitcher
Holy spirit penetrated my stone
Heart like the nails that were driven through your skin
I was smacked in the face with grace
Your righteousness given to me
I got a taste of your goodness
I'm not leaving I'm coming back for more and more
I spit out the slop I was eatin' on
Always left me dry
My bones have been made alive
From you breathing inside

Conversion, conversion
I crossed over the desert land
In your presence is where I stand now
Conversion, conversion
I was blinded swimming in my filthy
Now my heart has been turned to righteous
Righteous

I was a prisoner living in my prison
Of ignorance my mouth full of curses and bitterness
I was chained to my sin I was lovin'
Evil deeds in the dark
I was huggin' them tight
Close my eyes was clouded with lust for the adulteress
But her ways lead to death
I was on my way to hell
Ridin' on a train first class

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burdens of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith, I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burdens of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith, I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
And now I am happy all the day
And now I am happy all the day

I'm not the same man that I was
You stepped in and changed my heart
Now I'm walking the narrow road
Moved the scales from eyes
Transformed my soul
And now I see clear
You said, "Anyone to confess your name shall have life"
Now that I see, now that I see
And I want to be
