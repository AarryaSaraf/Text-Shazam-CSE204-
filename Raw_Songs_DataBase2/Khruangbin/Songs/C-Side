She got them red heels on
Gold hangin' from her ears
Melanin lady
She got her jig on strong
It's so good to be here
With you

Somebody's gonna fall in love tonight
And I hope we make sweet love tonight

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

You shine in a sea of people
Oh, this moment's so regal
Melanin lady
Covered in all white lace
You're the baddest in the place
So good, shawty

Somebody's gonna fall in love tonight
Let's lose ourselves in this second line tonight

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

God created you in the heavens just for me
Just for me
Been waiting so long for a woman like you
To make me feel so right

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street

Baby got me high like a kite
Got me high and don't need no green
Just two lovers dancin' in the night
While the horns blast in the street
