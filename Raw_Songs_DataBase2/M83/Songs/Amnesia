I believe in the darkness
It's just a sound
I'm in love with some sadness
It's just a sound
Ride with me

(Slipping through) My virtual magnet
(Kiss the rush of me and you) Automated bliss
Blinding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you

I'm in love with the darkness
It's just a sound
Nothing wrong with some sadness
It's just a sound
Ride with me

(Slipping through) My virtual magnet
(Kiss the rush of me and you) Automated bliss
Binding all over the touch of your hand
Metal rapture
Four minutes with you

So let's burn
Fast and bright
'Cause we will bleed
Die inside me
Floating for a miracle
Like pixies
Guide me to the last realm
This crimson love
It's a miracle
