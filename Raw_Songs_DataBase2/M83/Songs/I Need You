Have you ever had the feeling
That we're not alone?
All the calls I've been receiving
They are not from home
Going down the dusty roads
We can't see it now

I need you

There's a reading on the wall
of the things that I have done
if I belong to leave it all
find a way to take me

See, we're not alone
Just the colors of the world

Sitting all alone
