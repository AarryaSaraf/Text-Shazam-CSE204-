// Birds //

Sun is shining
Birds are singing
Flowers are growing
Clouds are looming
And I am flying

// Run Into Flowers //

Give me peace and chemicals, I want to run into...(flowers)

// America //

John, Christine is still with us Christine is dead, Laura Of course, of course,
I know but, you know the two ladies in the restaurant?
Well, they were watching us while we were eating.
They kept staring at us, they told me this because they could see sitting between us they could see
Christine sitting between us This is two people who we don't even know Listen, listen now.
There's one who's blind, she's the one that can see, she's the one who had the second sight,
and she, she's blind and she described to me Christine's red plastic mac Laura John Laura Listen,
I'm perfectly all right. In fact I haven't felt as good as this in months and months, I feel really fine.
I don't need pills, I'm not going crazy, I feel really great
When did the doctor say you can leave? Any time, I only fainted

// 0078h //

When you walked into my world
I was someone else's girl
Every time you look in my eyes
All that I felt somehow dies

No no no no
Can't you see what you're doing to me
No no no no

[Chorus]
Don't look at me with that smile
Don't act like everything's fine
Stop putting dreams in my head
When I should've thought of him instead

When you say the things you do
It makes me want to be with you
And every time that he kisses me
You are always what I see

No no no no
You make me forget about him
No no no no

[Chorus]

No no no no
Can't you see what you're doing to me
No no no no

[Chorus 2x]
