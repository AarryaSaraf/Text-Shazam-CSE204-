Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
I never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home
And sing a little love song
My love, to myself
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That what I said
No one's got to listen to
These words in my head
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay
