She says, "The odds are against you
She won't break his heart"
He says, "You'll lose the one sooner or later
Just being who you are"

This conversation's at an impasse
Maybe the future will look brighter undressed

We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors for tomorrow
'Cause no one's really better off
No one's really better off alone

She says, "No point speeding back to your place
I've got no other plans"
As they lay there bleeding on the freeway
He takes her by the hand

"I never wanted to disappoint you
At least I'll never even get the chance to"

We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors
The nights at home

We could be strangers for one night longer
Leave the crazy highs and the crazy lows

We could be strangers for one night longer
Who any of us are, well
Nobody knows

'Cause no one's really better off
No one's really better off alone
