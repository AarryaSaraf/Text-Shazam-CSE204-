Ancient holy wars, dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real
Original sin, genetic fate
Revolution, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
So commentary to comment on
Oh and no one ever really knows you when life is brief
So I've heard but what's that got to do with this black hole and me

Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden bows and mercury
Bohemian nightmare, Dust Bowl chic
This documentary is lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness
Oh and no one ever knows the real you when life is brief
So I've heard but what's that got to do with this atom bomb and me

Colosseum, families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name
Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, all my friends
Oh and love is just an institution based on human frailty
But what's your paradise got to do with Adam and Eve
Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
But what I fail to see is what that's got to do with you and me
