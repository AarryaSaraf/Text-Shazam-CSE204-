I hear a sound
It's going through my brain
I hear talk of people
I feel the fallin' rain

I see a man crying
'Cause the whole world has let him down
Kids are laughing at funny faces
Of a clown

My mind is like a spring in a clock
It won't unwind
I can't see, can't think, can't feel
I'm out of time

And don't forget kid's stake
Where kids lay bleeding on the ground
And there's no place on this planet
Where peace can be found

So there'll be stabbings and shootings
And young men dying all around
And it keeps going through my brain
And I can still hear the sound

I hear talking of people
The whole world has gone insane
