We met in a parking lot
I was buying coffee and cigarettes
Firewood and bad wine long since gone

But I'm still drunk and hot wide awake
Breathing hard
And now in just one years time I've become jealous
Rail thin 
Prone to paranoia when I'm stoned

This isn't true love someone ought to put me in a home
Say do you wanna get married
And put an end to our endless aggressive tendency to scorn
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your daddy's farm

For love to find us of all people
I never thought it'd be so simple

Let's buy a plantation house and let the yard grow wild
Until we don't need the signs that say keep out
I've got some folk bucks left and it's cheaper in the south

I need someone I can trust
To protect me from our seven daughters when my body says enough
Don't let me die in a hospital
I'll save the big one for the last time we make love

Insert here
A sentiment regarding golden years
All cause I went to the store one day
I've seen you around
What's your name
