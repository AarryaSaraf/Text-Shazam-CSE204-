I ran down the road
Pants down to my knees
Screaming, "Please come help me
That Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!"

And I'm writing a novel
'Cause it's never been done before

First house that I saw
I wrote, "House" up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out
"'Cause my reality is realer than yours"

And there's no time in the present
And there's a black dog on the bed

I went to the backyard
To burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said
"You can't turn nothing into nothingness with me no more"

Well I'm no doctor
But that monkey might be right
And if he is
I'll be walking him my whole life

I rode to Malibu
On a dune buggy with Neil
He said, "You're gonna have to drown me down on the beach
If you ever want to write 'the real'."

And I said "I'm sorry.
Young man what is your name again?"

Now everywhere I go
In West Hollywood
It's filled with people pretending they don't see the actress
And the actress wishing that they could

We could do ayahuasca
Baby, if I wasn't holding all these drinks

Something 'bout the way
Violet whips her hair
That makes me empty my pockets on the corner to corner
Bumming twenties as if I was the mayor

I don't need any new friends, Mama
But I could really use something to do
So if you're up for it sometimes
I swear you wouldn't have to be my muse

Heidegger and Sartre
Drinking poppy tea
I could've sworn last night I passed out in my van
And now these guys are pouring one for me

I'll never leave the canyon
'Cause I'm surrounded on all sides
By people writing novels
And living on amusement rides
