Everyman needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

Oh, oh

John the Baptist took Jesus Christ
Down to the river on a Friday night
They talked about Mary like a couple of boys
With nothing to lose, too scared to try

Everyman needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you, oh

Oh, oh

Joseph Campbell and The Rolling Stones
Couldn't give me a myth, so I had to write my own
Like I'm hung up on religion, though I know it's a waste
I never liked the name Joshua, I got tired of J

Everyman needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
