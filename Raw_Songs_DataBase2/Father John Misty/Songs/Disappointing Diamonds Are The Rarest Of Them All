Like a pervert on a crowded bus
A glare of love bears down on us
Like a carcass left out in the heat
This love is bursting out of me

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?
