Her parade on the ceiling
Was lookin' like rain
When he came by to borrow
Some blue sky
"I'm sleeping" she said
After a long nights dreamin'
Hard pressed for a reason
To get out of bed

Here he is beggin' for less than enough
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love

I can offer you sheets by the mile
If the Carlyle is out of rooms
I'm good for it
Why don't you ask?
But I can't bring her back

Now why would I do that?

When I ask what he wants
His only response
Is a single word less than I need
He watches TV
She reads the I Ching
And I keep my face nearly straight
When he tries to leave

She must be a dream, 'cause you never wake up
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
