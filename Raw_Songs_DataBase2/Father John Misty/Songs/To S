Flyin' on past in your voodoo mask
High on your own supply
And the way that you hold my hand to the bone
Honestly ain't half bad

No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you'd float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say

Guess what? I love you
Someone's gotta clean up the mess
There's parties to end in the kingdom of men
Someone's gonna need a new dress

No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you'd float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say
Is all you had to say
