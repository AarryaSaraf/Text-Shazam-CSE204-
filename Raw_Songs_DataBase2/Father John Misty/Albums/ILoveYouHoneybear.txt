Album: ILoveYouHoneybear

// I Love You, Honeybear //

Oh, honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-ooh
Mascara blood
Ash and cum
On the Rorschach sheets where we make love

Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-ooh
Fuck the world damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way

But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I want to watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say
In I-told-you-so voice
"It's just how we expected."

Everything is doomed, and nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear Ooh-Ooh Ooh-Ooh
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear Ooh-Ooh

You're bent over the altar
And the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door
Are probably conceiving a Damian

Don't they see the darkness rising?
Good luck figuring oblivion
We're getting out now while we can

You're welcome boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

But everything is fine
Don't give into despair
Cause I love you, honeybear

// Chateau Lobby #4 (In C For Two Virgins) //

Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We'll have satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the chateau lobby

I've never done this
Baby, be gentle
It's my first time
I've got you inside
People are boring
But you're something else completely
Damn, let's take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

I've never thought that
Ever thought that once
In my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you're something else I can't explain
You take my last name

First time, you let me stay the night despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script: "Stay as long as you want"
I haven't left your bed since

I haven't hated all the same things
As somebody else
Since I remember
What's going on for?
What are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?

// True Affection //

When can we talk
With the face
Instead of using all these strange devices?
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation
Wouldn't be that hard
Get along so well
Sentence by sentence
It's a trial run
Let me show you how
Figure I can give you true affection

True affection
True affection
True affection
True affection

When can we talk
With the face
Instead of using all these strange devices?
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation

When can we talk
With the face?
Figure I can give you true affection
Seems like
You and I
Need to have a crazy conversation

When can we talk
With the face?
Figure I can give you true affection

// The Night Josh Tillman Came To Our Apartment //

Oh, I just love the kind of woman who can walk over a man
I mean like a god damn marching band
She says, like literally, music is the air she breathes
And the malaprops make me want to fucking scream
I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well, it's literally not that

Of the few main things I hate about her, one's her petty, vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she's in the middle

Oh my God, I swear this never happens
Lately, I can't stop the wheels from spinning
I feel so unconvincing
When I fumble with your buttons

She blames her excess on my influence but gladly Hoovers all my drugs
I found her naked with the best friend in the tub
We sang "Silent Night" in three parts which was fun
Til she said that she sounds just like Sarah Vaughan
I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on
Why don't you move to the Delta?
I obliged later on when you begged me to choke ya

// When You're Smiling And Astride Me //

There's no need to fear me
Darling, I love you as you are when you're alone
I'll never try to change you
As if I could, and if I were to, what's the part that I'd miss most?
When you're smiling and astride me
I can hardly believe I've found you and I'm terrified by that

I've got nothing to hide from you
Kissing my brother in my dreams or finding God knows in my jeans
You see me as I am, it's true
Aimless, fake drifter, and the horny man child mama's boy to boot
That's how you live free
Truly see and be seen

// Nothing Good Ever Happens At The Goddamn Thirsty Crow //

Living it up
Have it all
Pull more women than any two men or train can haul
But my baby, she does something way more impressive than the Georgia Crawl
She blackens pages like a Russian romantic
Gets down more often than a blowup doll

Why the long face, Blondie? I'm already taken
Sorry
I may act like a lunatic
You think I'm fucking crazy, you're mistaken
Keep moving

On the road again
For months at a time
Doesn't take half that long for men about town to forget what's mine
Now my genius can't drink in silence
She's gotta listen to your tired-ass lines
I know it's hard to believe the good-hearted woman 
Could have a body that'd make your daddy cry

Why the long face, jerkoff? Your chance has been taken
Good one
You may think like an animal
If you try that cat-and-mouse shit, you'll get bitten
Keep moving

// Strange Encounter //

Only ever be the girl who just almost died in my house
Half naked, looking through your telephone
Run you a bath and try hard not to freak out

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

Wanna find somebody
Not like this
Yeah, I'm a decent person
Little aimless

It's all free and too easy, giving it away, giving it away
It's not cheap but here I am, giving it away, giving it away
Giving it away

Don't be my, don't be my, don't be my last strange encounter
The moment you came to, I swore I would change
Though neither one of us would leave unscathed
At least we'll both go on living

// The Ideal Husband //

Julian
He's gonna take my files

Every woman that I've slept with
Every friendship I've neglected
Didn't call when grandma died
I spend my money getting drunk and high
I've done things unprotected
Proceeded to drive home wasted
Bought things to win over siblings
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now
Now it's out
And now
Now it's out

Julian
He's gonna take my files

Telling people jokes to shut them up
Resenting people that I love
Sleep in 'til two then doin' shit
Just stay in bed and later lie 'bout it
Obsessing over greying hair
Knowing just what people wanna hear
Binging on unearned attention
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now
Now it's out
And now
Now it's out

I came by at seven in the morning
Seven in the morning, seven in the morning
I came by at seven in the morning
I said, "Baby, I'm finally succumbing"
Said something dumb like "I'm tired of running
Tired of running, tired of running"
Let's put a baby in the oven
Wouldn't I make the ideal husband?

// Bored In The USA //

How many people rise and say
"My brain's so awfully glad to be here
For yet another mindless day"?

I've got all morning to obsessively accrue
A small nation of meaningful objects
And they've got to represent me too

By this afternoon, I'll live in debt
By tomorrow, be replaced by children

How many people rise and think
"Oh good, the stranger's body's still here
Our arrangement hasn't changed?"

Now I've got a lifetime to consider all the ways
I've grown more disappointing to you
As my beauty warps and fades
I suspect you feel the same
When I was young, I dreamt of a passionate obligation to a roommate

Is this the part where I get all I ever wanted?
Who said that?
Can I get my money back?

Just a little bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, white Jesus
Bored in the USA
Oh, they gave me a useless education
And a subprime loan
On a craftsman home
Keep my prescriptions filled
And now I can't get off
But I can kind of deal
Oh, with being bored in the USA
Oh, just a little bored in the USA
Save me, President Jesus
I'm bored in the USA
How did it happen?
Bored in the USA

// Holy Shit //

Ancient holy wars
Dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real

Original sin, genetic fate
Revolutions, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
The commentary to comment on

Oh, and no one ever really knows you, and life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with this black hole in me?

Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden bows and mercury
Bohemian nightmare, dust bowl chic

This documentary's lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness

Oh, and no one ever knows the real you, and life is brief
So I've heard, but what's that gotta do with this atom bomb in me?

Coliseum families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name

Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, online friends

Oh, and love is just an institution based on human frailty
What's your paradise gotta do with Adam and Eve?

Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
But what I fail to see is what that's gotta do with you and me

// I Went To The Store One Day //

We met in a parking lot
Buying coffee and cigarettes
Firewood and bad wine long since gone
But I'm still drunk and hot, wide awake
Breathing hard

But now, in just one year's time
I've become jealous, rail-thin, prone to paranoia when I'm stoned
'Cause isn't true love "someone oughta put me in a home?"
Say, do you wanna get married and put an end to our endless regressive tendency to scorn?
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your daddy's farm
For love to find us of all people
I never thought it be so simple

Let's buy a plantation house and let the yard grow wild until we don't need the signs that say, "Keep out"
I've got some money left and it's cheaper in the South
I need someone I can trust to protect me from our seven daughters when my body says, "Enough!"
Don't let me die in a hospital, I'll save the big one for the last time we make love
Insert here a sentiment re: our golden years
All 'cause I went to the store one day
"Seen you around, what's your name?"
