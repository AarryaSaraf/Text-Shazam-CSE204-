// Change Up //

They thought I was gone, back from the grave
Mind of a master, blood of a slave
Heart of a king, stuck in between
The devil and the angel on my shoulder when I speak
Lost in the streets, found on the beat
Still kept a clip, asked and got it for cheap
Now I'm in a world where they pray for the weak
Stand up niggas, take shots to the knees

Lord have mercy, pray for me
Need to calm down so pass me the weed
Got me stressed out, situations look bleak
Time's running out, how my days turn to weeks?
Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in my drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

I'ma keep going, you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up

I'ma keep going, you cannot blame us
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never change up
Never look back, I would never

Every other day, always some shit
I'm the underdog but I'm never over it
Gotta keep a grip when the rent due
Niggas tryna get you for every last cent
Ain't no pretend, ain't tryna make ammends
Just tryna keep my legacy on legend in the end
So never try to sin, 'cause you could get bent
'Cause I protect from beginning to the end

Lord have mercy, pray for me
Distanced from my friends, enemies close to me
Gotta stay alert, things change in a blink
Gotta stay woke, they all in a deep sleep
Up all night, toss and turn when I sleep
Pacing around, drowning sorrows in a drink
Can't even think, got my mind wrapped up
But I still bite down, clench my teeth, knuckle up

// Theme Song //

You can act stupid if you want to
Never play by the rules, do just what I want to
Came up in this bitch strong, got without a strong front tooth
Now who they say is number one influence? So, he number two
Yeah, he dance good, but guess where he got the moves?
But compared to me, look like he wear two left shoes
Boy, I treat them little virgins like the restroom
Take my hand and dance with the Devil
Oh, boy, you in trouble, rattled the lion cage
Told God spray ya down while you're prayin' on stage
Jit at your burial, smoke squares at your grave
Then repent for my sins like, "God I'm saved"
He always forgive, later on, I forget
I had my fingers crossed so I'm back on that shit
Catch another body 'fore the song get mixed
The bullets is the lyrics, turn the rapper to a spirit
Singin' with the angels, nigga long gone
This song's like Bishop Ali Wong with a thong on
Nigga, I'm the wrong one to run on
My balls on her Kit-kat, now she playin' ping-pong

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger

Listen here, little Richard, I don't know what got into you
Did mo' for the game than you
That's why I had to cut into ya, you need to be checked
Lil niggas need to learn some respect
When your show's like The Rockettes with some majorettes
Give me a mic and the DJ and I'm set
'Cause these bars on deck, ain't gotta shake my ass
You the real definition of ants in yo' pants
Gotta son, lil niggas, no child support
Sorta like the Bad Boys up against Jordan
But nigga, you ain't scorin', not on me
Wrote this one on one knee, RIP the P
Taught me to keep it real, stand on my own
If I got to, rock a nigga brain with his nose blown
No time for the gimmicks and
I ain't gotta lie when I say I'm independent

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger

// Dirty Laundry //

The hybrid, telling you try again
Sleep with the beast, Daniel in the lions den
Still drop dirty, after poppin' niacin
Itched all damn day, just to get violated
Ever scene a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, and had money for the room
So we did the Humpty Hump in a Burger King bathroom
Low-key, kept it undercover
The way she slurp, slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat, white bitch named Helen
Three hundred pounds, maybe 'round like two eighty
Had a couple babies, two seventy, give or take
Call that securing the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Tried to stop how I eat, so I got up on his ass

What's in the dark always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ride dirty
Shit get messy, knock 'em out with a thirty
High tide, game north of Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system tryna drown me
Stain your record like Clorox and darks
Spin cycle, half, where it's hot for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothing
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin
Papa was a rolling stone, so I sold rocks to him
Beam up Scotty, we got lift off Houston
Left my sack in my clothes, mama just did a load
8-ball in my jeans, they say it tastes like soap

Twenty five peep show when I enter the booth
Mop the floor when I leave, might slip if you do
Cover your the ears of your kids, we got round two
Fuck a bitch two times, call it deja vu
Fuck a stripper for some change, actual change
Dimes, pennies, nickels, actual change
Okay, wanna hear this story?
Left the house in a hurry
I was in Hunky Dory's
Got some dash from Laurie
Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
And the girl had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her I'm sorry
It's slow anyway, but thought you was borin'
Said, gimme, I'm on it
Jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moanin' and groaning
Guess who I seen doin' laundry next morning?

// 3 Tearz //

Used to cut the rock with no glove on
Shove on, for the block, developed a 'Love Jones'
The reasons why your hoe got them rug burns
It's 'No limit', call me 'Mr. Serv-on'
Work all day till the work gone
Talking back in the day when I had chirp phone
My nigga made a wrong turn, got flipped in the zone
Had to say I was a smoker just so I could go home
Everyday another episode
I'm just tryna hear the beat like a stethoscope
Like my bassline's thick, like a Texas hoe
It was written but the signature not legible
Drink so much, I could drown a fish
On some other shit, a demon on the hunt for the succubus
Why you on some cuddle shit? Hit it then fuck a bitch
I don't think you know who you're fucking with

Two tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Two tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing

Danny is dangerous, Run the Jewels is chaos and arrangement
Shit'll give your fuck face a face lift
Papa did the triple Lindsey flip when the 'cane hit
Mama never met a bottle that she couldn't drain quick, aye
Stuck in a rude mood, the fuck shit approaches
Like we believe in nothing, Lebowski, there's no motive
I'm Babylon, tryna get bags like fuck all of 'em
Death is on my couch and I'm tellin' him jokes, stallin' him
Plus, I offer one of my smokes, he smoked all of 'em
True Doom eat up the crew like 'Mm... Food'
Say the name, it's like you're praying for pain, we too rude
Gotta brain? You gon' move it or lose it, you screwed
I'm profane, yes deranged and I say, "Real shit"
If I'm correct, the really cool kids probably callin' it 'lit'
Call the shit that I am culling from my brain with a switch
Hold my beer, I'm 'bout to go and get rich, motherfuckers

Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing

Hold up, I don't give a fuck 'bout Trump, who got dumped
Who protestin' collections at their garbage dump?
And I don't really give a fuck about giving a fuck
And who feels the black celebrities ain't givin' enough
Give 'em the dick, fat slick son of a bitch
Better than you are, what you are's the son of a whore
My dad told me that your mom was something mean on her knees
But thank God we ain't related 'cause she swallowed the seeds
Happy belated, I'm elated to know we ain't related
So tell your special kids stop saying, "Auntie Shay" to my lady
I sip on fine wines, fine dine with dimes and nines
I got an Einstein mind and I still tote iron
I'm a P-I-M-P in my own rhyme
Space age, gorilla pimpin' out the cage with mine (What you steal from me nigga?)
If it's goddamn mine (Would you kill for me nigga?), bitch, you out yo' goddam mind
And that's goddamn right, I'm goddam Mike
Win in the end, like Tina did goddamn Ike

Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing
Three tears in the bucket, fuck it
I don't care about nothing, nothing

// Belly Of The Beast //

Maniac off Xanny bars, sack like Santa Claus
That puts you in the figure-forum
My literature is like I wrote it in silver
And you're on the podium with speech eroding 'em
Your bitch like a leech on my scrotum
Hoe tried to kill the dick, strangled 'em and choked 'em
After she was done, I looked down at my penis
Like she really ain't mean it
Nigga, I'm anaemic with the ink, you a Stevie Wonder, blink
I take a piss in the same sink you wash dishes with
You're illiterate, your Bisquick soft
I put the biscuit, then you dip like cocktail sauce
I eat so many shrimp I got iodine poison
Hoes on my dick 'cause I look like Roy Orbison
Got a foursome with four fours and I called it 'a twelve'
One was chubby, one was ugly, whack as hell

This can't be real, I'm in a dream
I don't have skin, I just shine
They can't contain me, I'm free
It feels like losing your mind

Psycho, crazy, deranged
Spitting on tracks like oncoming train
Vocal laid down like tower of burning flame
Sippin' gasoline, made a full canteen
Stone Temple Pilot, crashed into the wall
While listening to Wu-Tang and rubbing on his balls
Off the bars of footballs, thoughts playing foosball
In V.I.P., sleep with shades on the boo-ya
So, bitch, bust that shit open like you landed knee first
Let me stuck my finger in it, what it smelled like? Birth
If it smelled like syrup, you gon' get this work
But if it smelled like perch, gotta disperse
I'm a pervert wearing Sherbert
Tell your baby mama turn her ass
A younger mama shoulda handcuffed me to the furnace

This can't be real, I'm in a dream
I don't have skin, I just shine
They can't contain me, I'm free
It feels like losing your mind

// Savage Nomad //

Fuck school, stole the scales outta chemistry class
And made it all come back like memory lapse
I'm in that matte-black 'Lac
Strap under the floor mat
A weatherman it be, I predict the forecast
Shower any beat with the dirtiest vocab
This was the 70s, I'd be a Savage Nomad
Shirtless, wearin' a vest, stayin' warm by burnin' trash
Give a toe-tag to a broke-ass
To tote fast or slow pass
Who ya think you're dealin' with?
My résumé could kill a bitch
Dealt with so much pain that I don't even know what feeling is
Block of boarded houses, in-between 'em lie the killin' fields
Been through so many raids, we treat that shit like it's a fire drill
Mayday, mayday, sound the alarm
No ice on my neck, but she love me for my charm
Might sniff on the weekend and sip on some XO
Back up in the bitch like I just fucked my ex hoe
My vocal take a green beret
Kill the verse, reboot the K
Service when I word it, sweet enough to leave a tooth decay
Over your charades, I gave my all like energy
Heard your music, feel sorry for anybody that plays
Or sways or even says that they like the shit
Nigga, I'm far a hoe, but life's a bitch
And if any other nigga got a problem with me
I'll pull up on your playground at a quarter to three
Muhfucker

Now who you think you're dealin' with?
The flow Chinese arithmetic
Trippin' if they get real nasty like black liquorice
Always on some different shit
Your whole style is impotent
I ignore a whore like a email from LinkedIn
I put you further in that hole that you're sinkin' in
Mixin' Red Bull, listenin' to Minnie Riperton
It's quite simple, I'm mental all over instrumental
Detrimental to hit, lyrics is quintessential
Fuck around and, ay, ay, make the, make money
I whip they head, they gotta wrap it up like newborn's head
(I whip ya head, boy)
No, can't be continued
Doc attendin' to you
Take 'em down, makin' ya cold when I give it to ya
Every day same shit, different porta-potty
Fuck the game up, you niggas buzzin' like a tyke
Bunch of Danny copies, but they trash is sloppy
Mistake that for the real and you deserve a highway robbery

// Best Life //

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la
Sugar sweet, let's shine

Come from the sewer where hot dogs got boiled
Right up in the same pot, uncooked, the rock
Went from flippin' them mats, to flippin' them sacks
Hide and seek, send spots to out on, we sell crack, facts
War on drugs was a chess game
Was a pawn, girls drawn on my front lawn
Just a young nigga, starin' down the corner
Checkin' out the hustlers with the latest kicks on 'em
Know a nigga want, momma ain't got it
Fuckin' up a school line, what she know about it?
I was just a young nigga, know what I was headed for
Jumped up off the porch, really, I wasn't ready for it
Get up off the hood, find a way out
Road I'm on, either death or jail house
Wanna get away from all this stress
For me, momma just wanted the best (Uh)

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life

Let the past be the past, like a bitch with a ass
Left you for a nigga with cash, came back
Ass fatter, lookin' better than ever
Talkin' bout gettin' back together, nigga, I'm 'bout to smash (Uh)
I'm a bad whatchamacallit, used to blow on the corner
After lyin' down on the counter, smoke this of my bong
You the type to cry and yell out, "Turn up"
Not supposed to be here, dead, like Weekend at Bernie's
Used to bag up the weed, and live on for the count
Bought myself a new spot and I never got lonely
Shit, you could ask all of my homies
Caught the bus with some stacks, and I kept the heater on me
(Uh)

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la
Sugar sweet, let's shine

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life
Livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life, I'm livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so I'm livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life

// Shine //

19s but I keep them plain, though
Leather inside, dark tinted window
Wood-grain wheel, tell me how you really feel?
Why I pass, all they kids yellin' out, "Bingo"
Talk a good game, Trey Wingo
Speak in code so nobody know the lingo
Life like a dice game, ain't no casino
Street light contra, ain't no cheat code
Every day on the line like a free throw
Shit weak, like the knees on D-Rose
I was taught look out for your people
Meet Heaven, then ya gotta know evil
Heart of lion, eye of a eagle
Life a movie but ain't no sequel
Switch lanes in that new thang
Got it in redline while I'm playin' Flock of Seagulls
So, no way we could ever be equal
In the haystack I was that needle
Hold it in, thinkin' no on would believe you
Lose it all in a second like me too
The ho or the seafood
Gun shots echo, never be peaceful
Smokin' Diesel to forget it all
If I ain't do nothin' I'ma ball

Ay, gotta get what's mine
Ay, before I lose my mind
Ay, like I'm runnin' outta time
Ay, shine, like man, shine

Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball

Ay, gotta ball till ya fall
In a system that designed, one strike, take it all
Ay, all it take, one call
Pray you lose it all, one second, all gone
Ay, know you feelin' all alone
But who can you turn to when things go wrong?
Ay, it's plot all along
Push you down the wrong path, the statistics have shown
Everything that I'd known, turned out to be lies
Found out when I was grown so I shared that light
On these dark undertones, had a nigga head gone
S'why they buy the diamonds and that Perc' is shiny chrome
My fault, all alone in the scheme of it all
Played like a bong, had to stay strong
Kept my head above water, had to keep movin' on
Had my head above water, had to keep movin' on

Ay, gotta get what's mine
Ay, before I lose my mind
Ay, like I'm runnin' outta time
Ay, shine, like man, shine

Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball

The dream is realized, my heart skips a beat
I'm tyin' my feet, if baby can't sleep
The feat that's unreached, furnace relaxed
The weed that's unsown, white men will attack
Fact that's unlocked, dread that's untied
Mind can explode, time it can't tide

// Combat //

Twelve-gauge shotguns, I seen twelve-gauge, um, pumps

I don't give a fuck
I could talk a cat off the back of a fish truck
Tell me what's up
All about the game, so I'm hunting big buck
Big butt, slim waist, and her hair long
Pass it down to me like a heirloom
The Henny got me wetter than Will Piss
I die for this like Elvis
Boss up and shake down
Get it jumpin' like a techno breakdown
Night young and we just gettin' started
Let me walk on yard at the Bruiser Brigade party
Got smoke, of course
Goin' up, fireworks on the fourth
Take mine, and I do it with force
Been with this shit since I jumped off the porch
Used to chop grams on my grandma's sauce
Pay me what it costs, I ain't tryna hear or
Tryna play round, you be hangin' with (Huh)
Cop a pound and it put me down an ounce
Bust it open like them hoes came in
Got more bills than the Olsen twins
Focus, I can see where ocean is
Kush thinkin' like it broke the wind

What it is, what it is, what you know about
Came a long way from that dope house
What it is, what it is, what you know about
Came a long way from the

All I cared about was the stacks and the stage
When it's time to re-up, pull my partner out his head
Ain't rocket science class, I ain't tryna pass math
Put grams on the scale, watch me do arts and crafts
Anything could be my last, livin' like that
Tripped over the crack, crippled by circumstance
Nigga gotta face the facts, mixed with your own
Sun spread your light, others make a marathon
Tryna live on through my music
The future influence, the next to do it
The odds are against you, kiddo
Likin' everything from you, like a divorced widow
Tryna get it like the next negro
Want beef? You gon' fuck around and end up a vegetable
Tryna give you a little game
Get some, get locked, and back again

What it is, what it is, what you know about
Came a long way from that dope house
What it is, what it is, what you know about
Came a long way from the

It's a combat zone
Everything, what they on
Red top, blue top
Get the green, hold the block
It's a combat zone
Everything, what they on
Red top, blue top
Get the green, hold the block
It's a combat zone
Tryna get that bag
Cash that lick, get that bag
It's a combat zone
Tryna swerve around 12
It never fail when you goin' through Hell
It's a combat zone
Count that lick real quick (Combat)
Get the bag, get the bag, whatchu got
It's a combat zone
Get that lick real quick (Combat)
Get the bag up, and the swag up
Before the car pull back up

Listen, all a nigga wanted was a Chevy or some
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout no lawyer, nigga, fuck savin'
Didn't know we'd see them whores like Wes Craven
Hook jumpin' out them fan stores on payment
Locked up with dirty white boys, all musty
Prayin' for probation, hope I get lucky
Court-appointed lawyers, gotta stay copping
Put you in predicament, but that's your only option
Sink or swim, look at him in the system
Just another nigga, one-way ticket to a prison
Tried to help, only hurt in the end
How the fuck 'posed to take care your kids in the pen'
It's the life that we chose, friends become foes
That nigga snitched on, everybody know
Son don't know how to stick to the code
Nobody to trust, that's the way life goes

I've seen hand grenades (Combat zone)
I've seen beer... beer-can (Combat), beer-can bazookas made (Combat zone)
Damn things hit you (Combat), just-just as getting hit with a gun (It's a combat zone)
I've seen .22 zip guns (Combat), I've seen .38 zip guns
I've seen (Combat zone), I'll tell you, this about things you think you'd never see on the street I've seen (Combat)
I've seen dynamite on the street
I've seen all this
You'd be surprised, man
Pretty soon they're gonna steal the damn atom bomb
