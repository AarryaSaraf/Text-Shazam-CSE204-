The hybrid, telling you try again
Sleep with the beast, Daniel in the lions den
Still drop dirty, after poppin' niacin
Itched all damn day, just to get violated
Ever scene a roach with babies have babies?
In the hood like whatever, we in this bitch together
Once got a ho, and had money for the room
So we did the Humpty Hump in a Burger King bathroom
Low-key, kept it undercover
The way she slurp, slurp, she's the quicker picker upper
No job, dropped out and a felon
On the net, met a fat, white bitch named Helen
Three hundred pounds, maybe 'round like two eighty
Had a couple babies, two seventy, give or take
Call that securing the bag, had to fight the baby dad
Tried to stop how I eat, so I got up on his ass

What's in the dark always come to light
Head was nasty, you'd think she had head lice
Why try? Throw bleach in your eye
Put your life on the line, hang 'em out to dry
Tryna keep my hands clean, out here ride dirty
Shit get messy, knock 'em out with a thirty
High tide, game north of Arm and Hammer
Swim towards the current, system tryna drown me
Stain your record like Clorox and darks
Spin cycle, half, where it's hot for one
Out the slums, nobody gave me nothing
Had temptations, so I hustled, David Ruffin
Papa was a rolling stone, so I sold rocks to him
Beam up Scotty, we got lift off Houston
Left my sack in my clothes, mama just did a load
8-ball in my jeans, they say it tastes like soap

Twenty five peep show when I enter the booth
Mop the floor when I leave, might slip if you do
Cover your the ears of your kids, we got round two
Fuck a bitch two times, call it deja vu
Fuck a stripper for some change, actual change
Dimes, pennies, nickels, actual change
Okay, wanna hear this story?
Left the house in a hurry
I was in Hunky Dory's
Got some dash from Laurie
Left my wallet at home, ain't wanna hear that story
And the girl had change from laundry
Had to wash clothes anyway, told her I'm sorry
It's slow anyway, but thought you was borin'
Said, gimme, I'm on it
Jumped on it and bounced
No fabric softener, 'cause I was hard
Then she gave me head, had me moanin' and groaning
Guess who I seen doin' laundry next morning?
