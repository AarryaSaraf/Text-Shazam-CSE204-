Can't see, way too much smoke in here (Yeah)
We ain't been broke in years (Nah)
But still act like we ain't had shit, get outta here (Get outta here)
Nigga, you was never there (Nah)
Couple stacks, eight ball and a rock 
And I'ma stop there (Yeah)
Statute of limitations is not fair (Yeah)
But still pay for yo' bitch manicure
But only fuck with her 'cause the homegirl sell me Adderall (Haha)
But we ain't ever sell that all

So everyday gets loopier
She takin' off her clothes, would think we gave her Everclear (Step)

Put it in her big hole and squirt it out her little hole (Hahahaha)


I wanted to pay this and the plug wanted that
We met in the middle because opposites attract
I cut the pack, make the brick collapse
I  bitches to do things when my fingers snap
Uh, I never lost a challenge
Boy and girl in my home, I'm a foster parent
Run with the lions, berry
Pounds of the loud, very
Drinkin' Dom Peri', I'm with Danny Brown
And a blonde bitch with no belly
Uh, whole things ain't make it enough
I'm shaving weight like Hydroxycut, uh
'Til my profits start proppin' up, uh
It's a part of the business to go away for years, like the Olympics
Can I get a witness? Huh, you better say no
You ain't seen nothin'
I grew up with niggas that didn't wanna be nothin'

Uh, movin' O's to make bread, that's a bagel
Got the fiends off the boy, dancin' like Fabo
Uh, we wear cardi's to parties, race 'Raris
Date Barbies, smoke Marley and show up to court tardy
This DMT got me thinkin' that I can't make the week
I need it quicker, plottin' on a white girl like them guys that tried to kidnap Whitmer
I'm a Laker, you a Clipper
This is God talkin' and this is scripture, listen, uh


Hail Mary, hail Mary
Come with me or you're calling people for commissary
 a nigga like Tom and Jerry
Give 'em baby showers like Burberry
Doin' this 'til 
On you niggas heads like tooth fairies
Smash a bitch like blueberries
Made her ass whine, now my time to shine
Got that good water like alkaline
Asinine, thinkin' that you could fuck with mine
Y'all niggas stuck in time
Like a lost notebook with forgotten rhymes

Of course, of course
We gettin' money because we take yours
Bonjour, bonjour
Moncler and the AP is offshore
