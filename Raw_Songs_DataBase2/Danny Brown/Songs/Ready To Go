Go


Back up on it like dumps in a truck
Dan make a player just wanna go guts
I be gettin' clunked 'cause they get one time
That thing jiggle even when she strut
Ayy, ayy, know what's up
Tryna get behind it when you're doin' toe-tucks
Shootin' my shot and I'm hittin' in the clubs
Make a player just wanna go nuts
Work that shit, let me have some more
Let me take the red off, let me crack the go
Could you get up on it while you drop it low
You already know I'm read' to go
No, throw it on me, baby girl, throw it back
Know where I'm goin' but you got me off track
God damn, girl, just how you do that?
Make me wanna double take, got me lookin' back
