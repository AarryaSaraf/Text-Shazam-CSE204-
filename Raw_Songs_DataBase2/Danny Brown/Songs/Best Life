La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la
Sugar sweet, let's shine

Come from the sewer where hot dogs got boiled
Right up in the same pot, uncooked, the rock
Went from flippin' them mats, to flippin' them sacks
Hide and seek, send spots to out on, we sell crack, facts
War on drugs was a chess game
Was a pawn, girls drawn on my front lawn
Just a young nigga, starin' down the corner
Checkin' out the hustlers with the latest kicks on 'em
Know a nigga want, momma ain't got it
Fuckin' up a school line, what she know about it?
I was just a young nigga, know what I was headed for
Jumped up off the porch, really, I wasn't ready for it
Get up off the hood, find a way out
Road I'm on, either death or jail house
Wanna get away from all this stress
For me, momma just wanted the best (Uh)

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life

Let the past be the past, like a bitch with a ass
Left you for a nigga with cash, came back
Ass fatter, lookin' better than ever
Talkin' bout gettin' back together, nigga, I'm 'bout to smash (Uh)
I'm a bad whatchamacallit, used to blow on the corner
After lyin' down on the counter, smoke this of my bong
You the type to cry and yell out, "Turn up"
Not supposed to be here, dead, like Weekend at Bernie's
Used to bag up the weed, and live on for the count
Bought myself a new spot and I never got lonely
Shit, you could ask all of my homies
Caught the bus with some stacks, and I kept the heater on me
(Uh)

La la la la la, la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la la la
Sugar sweet, let's shine

'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
Livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so now I'm tryna live my best life
I'm livin' my best life
Livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life, I'm livin' my best life
'Cause ain't no next life, so I'm livin' my best life
I'm livin' my best life
