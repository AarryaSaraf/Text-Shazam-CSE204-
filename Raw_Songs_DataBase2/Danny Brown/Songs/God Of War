I got a question
Is anybody up there?
And if so do he really care
That we got hungry babies an old folks without hope
The good die young behind gun smoke
From where the cracks long
Where we expect to die young
Make it to your thirties you're considered a legend
The D is like Babylon
Where you get clapped upon
A murder relay
We hanging double time
Drop rate increases
While wages decreases
They shooting up the schools, make you wonder what they teaching
The young is ceases
The elders in pieces
Played by the rules and the system still cheated
And the other ones locked and in debt to society
The other ones in debt
Tell me what's the irony?
Pressure in my head
Stress in my head
But I got a couple questions before I go to bed

I got a question, are you listening God?
And if so can I get a nod?
I got a question, let me know can you help?
Or am I just talking to myself?
I got a question, are you listening God?
I got a question, are you listening God?

Used to play the porch, broke smoking on the port
Staring at the sky feeling like I've lost hope
Hard to believe when you want some Mickey-D's
You're looking in your fridge all a nigga got is cheese
Broke with no cheese bring a nigga to his knees
Make his palms come together
And his in present please
And when you have C's
Surely you'll see
The value of life such a privilege to be
It's so ridiculous tell me what you see
Turn on your TV all you see is vote for me
But will things change man I really don't know
Right behind on my rent
Ducking from my landlord
The light bill too
Even my phone due
Bout to cut a nigga off
So I'm tryna cut you
Ask God questions almost everyday
Always get my answers a damn year late

I got a question, are you listening God?
And if so can I get a nod?
I got a question, let me know can you help?
Or am I just talking to myself?
I got a question, are you listening God?
I got a question, are you listening God?
