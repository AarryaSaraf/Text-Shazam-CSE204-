(Bruiser Brigade!)
Belly of the beast where the sheep get eat, ain't nowhere safe for you (You)
Catch you in the alleyway slippin' or dippin', I'ma knock out your front tooth (Tooth)
You ain't gotta say what it is, I mean I already know what's true (Uh-huh)
Back in the day you say you slay but we all know not true (Uh-uh)
You don't really want no drama, lashed at me and I backstab you (You)
I consider that karma, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth (Tooth)
Ain't no chat, when I see you I don't know what I'm gon' do (Nah)
But prepare for a clash, I'll dash and run right straight through you (Step)
Why you wanna play me for a pussy? You looking for a gash you gon' get gashed (Gashed)
Better not overlook me, least expect it, you'll get bashed (Bashed)
Why you wanna hide? When I find you, you know you know that's your ass (Ass)
 care 'bout yo' tunes, that shit you drop, that shit be trash (Ha)
I don't really wanna do this but you left me with no option (Nah)
I'ma just eat yo' food and leave you left out somewhere, starving (Uh-huh)
Why you wanna hit my jack with that, you know you push my button (Yeah)
Lyin', talking 'bout what it is but in reality it's nothin'

Rollin' round, the ends meet
I been trappin', I been snappin' for the intake
Got the product I ain't worried 'bout the outtake
Fiends lining up a  ballin' out the estate
Rollin' round, the ends meet
(Yeah man, wagwan)
Rollin' round, the ends meet
(Want to learn to respect me, even if it kills you) (Go)

Rolling around in a manor, old bill tryna put me in a slammer (Slammer)
I ain't tryna be anaconda, eatin' up porridge and a banana (Nah)
You better change your grammar, when you talk to me talk to me with respect ('Spect)
Pussy ho ain't finna man up, check yo' mate, I ain't talking 'bout chess (Chess)
My youth hold that Rambo, when he outside protect yo' neck (Neck)
With yo' life he gamble, with that knife he poke yo' chest (Chest)
Stomp a man out in trainer if he ain't got no banger (Banger)
Now you wanna go and change up, when you cross road it's danger (Danger)
You don't really want no war, white flecks, say no more (No more)
Any conflict, address, your block on the floor (Floor)
You don't really want no war, white flecks, say no more (No more)
Any conflict, address, your block on the floor
When your in my ends, mind your manner (Manner)
You cocky fools try to break the rules and I'll bang ya, bang ya
When your in my ends, mind your manners
Before I pull a Full Metal Jacket with the banger, banger

Rollin' round, the ends meet
I been trappin', I been snappin' for the intake
Got the product I ain't worried 'bout the outtake
Fiends lining up a  ballin' out the estate
Rollin' round, the ends meet
(Yeah man, wagwan)
Rollin' round, the ends meet
(You people are going to respect me if it kills you)
