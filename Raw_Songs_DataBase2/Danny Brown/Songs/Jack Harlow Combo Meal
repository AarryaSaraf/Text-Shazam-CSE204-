Check
I done bossed up when I big bossed on that hoe like, "Sayonara" (Style)
Got big pockets like a fat man
Nigga, you won't see tomorrow
One phone call, your family's sorrow (Go)
Just be a whole bunch pyro
Shootin' on niggas like Jannero Pargo (Doot, doot, doot, doot)
Hold up, watch out (Watch out)
Nigga, I'm about to go nuts (Go nuts)
Hoe, you say what? (Say what?)
Nigga better keep it on the hush
I'm out my mind, I don't care 'bout this plan (Style)
Rip it off, then I'm somewhere in a trance (Style)
Now I'm bettin' y'all niggas can't handle me
Now I'm bettin' y'all niggas can't stand me
Hold up, calm down (Calm down)
Nigga, just take a deep breath (Breath)
Told you, watch out (Watch out)
Better not take another step (Uh-uh)
When I won, niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Nah)
I been a flex, nigga, somethin' to see (Yeah)
I make it hard for you niggas to breathe (Uh)
Never be another motherfucker like me (No)
Actin' so grand, and, everything I wear is bandage
'Bout to run up on you, take your spot and take your business
Man, I can't fuck with y'all niggas, y'all lame, Jack Harlow sell y'all chicken


Uh, this that irregular wave
I'm smokin' somethin' unusual, but to me it's just regular haze
They comin' to clean up my cuticles
Tired of smokin' these regular strains
You get used these crackers accusin' you
When you black, it's a regular thing
Uh, girl, it's been minutes, it's been hours
And it's been days, bitch
I pray for you, always, it's so tragic, babe
Uh, yeah, yeah, your path is lookin' like shit (Like shit)
Your bag is lookin' like shit (Like shit)
That ass is lookin' like shit (Like shit)
Almost thirty, don't know who you is, bitch, work it out
You ain't even on shift, mm, look (Everything about JPEGs, I like)
Back in this bitch like , shoulder leanin' like I'm Joe
All of that royalty, power, that fame and respect
It can't change the fact that you a hoe
Barkin' like Uzi, keep thinkin' you Boosie
When you could end up goin' out like the crow
Niggas want action, I'm not into actin'
Put you on the screen like I'm Christopher Nol'
