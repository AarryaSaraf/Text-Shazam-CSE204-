// How Could I Know? //

How long must we try?
Choke back on these words we chose
That part of me is taking over

Hold on to what you have
Let go of the things you hold
That part of me is taking over

I wanna believe
This will be over eventually
And I believe
This part of me is gone
And I've moved on

How could I know
Everything I've broken down so long ago?

Sing back, must we try?
React to this firefight
This part of me is taking over

I wanna believe
This will be over eventually
And I believe
This part of me is gone

How could I know?
Everything I've broken down so long ago
How could I know?
Everything I've broken down somewhere I know
I know

How long must we try?
To react to this firefight
How long must we try?
How long?

How could I know?
Everything I've broken down so long ago
How could I know?
Everything I've broken down somewhere I know
I know

// Goodnight Tonight //

Now that the hurting time is all but gone
Like you I have no regrets
Can't think of on my love with you I've touched the sun

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

I'll never forget you
I'll always be near
Once lovers now forever friends
There's no love that's stronger
Than a love that can say go run free
Cause I'll never stand in your way

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

How could I let you go I hear them say
You were my reason
You were my day
You made me the way that I am
Maybe one day they'll understand

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's
