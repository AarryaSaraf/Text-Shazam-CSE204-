// My Heart And I //

My heart and I have wandered aimlessly
Beneath the weeping willow searching for the sun
Time after time we've met each other in a dream
And we have gazed upon the miracle of love

My heart and I have heard the angels sing
And we have found upon life's broken wing
And now we know that love is
Just another rainbow in the sky

Mother comfort us in thee we trust
Have mercy on my heart and I

My heart and I will know no happiness
As long as we see hate and bitterness
And like a child we close our eyes
Do not forsake us when we cry

Mother comfort us in thee we trust
Have mercy on my heart and I

// Desire (Chi Mai) //

Come, come into my arms
Lay down here beside me
Gently guide me
The pain and pleasure
I'm scared to you

A man by design
Perfect and divine
Lover lets cover each other with gladness
Come come and discover each other with wonder
Ah, lover let's cover each other with love

Oh, sweet passion
Cover me
Take me like the first time
Is a last time
Oh, gently open wide

Oh, my heart is on fire
Burning with desire
Lover lets cover each other with gladness
Come come and discover each other with wonder
Ah, lover let's cover each other with love

Love, love, love
Mmmm...

// Hurry To Me //

Come on, hurry hurry hurry to me
You can share or tell your worries to me
Use my shoulder anytime
To laugh or cry on

When each day is over make your way to me
And don't let anything delay you
I will always be someone
You can rely on

Don't let's waste a precious little minute
Let's be sure to use each second
And in the end that way
To make the best of ev'ry day

Come on, hurry hurry hurry to me
You can share or tell your worries to me
Anywhere you are
I won't be far away

Hear my heart beating
Each beat keeps asking
You to stay near me
Can't your heart hear me?

Let love forever
Keep us together
Love where deep as mine
Is worth a lifetime

// Come Sail Away //

So long ago
So far away
Two hearts in love
And stars above
And make believe

As soft and slow
I sail away
Come back with me
Across the sea of memories

Do you remember
Those golden days
Come sail away
Come sail away

Where once my love
Upon a time
We fell in love
And taught the stars to shine

So long ago
So far away
But now and then
I sail again
To yesterday

The sun sets low
Upon the bay
So come and we
Will cherish every precious ray

Do you remember
Those golden days
Come sail away
Come sail away

So come my love
Let love be true
Remember me
As I remember you

// Here's To You //

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts

That agony is your triumph

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart

Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours
That agony is your triumph

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours
That agony is your triumph

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours
That agony is your triumph

Here's to you, Nicola and Bart
Rest forever here in our hearts
The last and final moment is yours
That agony is your triumph

// Song For Elena //

The memory of every yesterday
Still lingers and I hear the silence say
This is forever
Never be afraid, no never fear
The paradise you lost is always near
Forever
Forever and a day
The past is like a lover's kiss
It never fades away

Although I've travelled far from paradise
The only world I'll ever recognize
Will turn forever
There is no beginning and no end
The moment only dies to live again
Forever
Forever and a day
The past is like a kiss
It never fades away

You will always be my one and only passion
And every kiss and joyous fear
Has gone and left me here
Alone the way I was before

Behind the shuttered door of my room
Each and every single word returns to haunt me
And from above I pray the rain
Will fall and ease the pain

My song is carried by the wind
That leads me to your door
You'll be there to hold me
Why if you and I were made to be together
Why have they taken you away

And why couldn't you stay
It's cold and lonely without you
And if you're lonely too
Call and I will follow

// Saharan Dream //

Ooh, to dream a dream or two
Ooh, and to believe in you

Saharan winds to bring me wings to fly
So far away so far so high
Saharan mystery
Will charm the words
That mark the history
Of wars and world

I'll cross the night
And come to you
You'll take me to heights
Beyond the blue
The blue of a sweet Saharan dream

Ooh, so far across the dune
Ooh, Saharan dream of you

// Could Heaven Be //

Could Heaven be
This harmony
These two hearts beating as one
This true love we have begun
Forever and eternally
Sounds heavenly in love to me

Could Heaven be
Two stars at sea
Like angels of a feather
Do we belong together
Could Heaven be
This rhapsody in blue

Could Heaven be
So close to me
And you...
