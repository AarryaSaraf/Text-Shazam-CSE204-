Now that the hurting time is all but gone
Like you I have no regrets
Can't think of on my love with you I've touched the sun

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

I'll never forget you
I'll always be near
Once lovers now forever friends
There's no love that's stronger
Than a love that can say go run free
Cause I'll never stand in your way

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

How could I let you go I hear them say
You were my reason
You were my day
You made me the way that I am
Maybe one day they'll understand

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's

Good night tonight just hold me close till we rise
Good night tonight tomorrow we'll save for goodby's
