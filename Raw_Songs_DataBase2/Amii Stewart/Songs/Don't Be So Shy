Ok, let's go for it, give me the key, baby
Ok

Tell me why you're so shy, baby
Don't you know I want to get close to you
Baby, come to me
'Cause I got what you need

Oh, why you're so shy, tell me
Why you're so shy, oh, oh, oh

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh

Are you feelin' all alone boy
Thinkin' that no one could understand
If you'd only reach out boy
Maybe then someone would take your hand

'Cause I'd like to get to know you
But you've got to make your move
If you want it, then come and get it
Can't you see that I'm attracted
Baby don't keep holdin' back
Make your move, and make it soon
See what I'm sayin'

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh, oh
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh
Are you lonely on your own boy
I can understand the way you feel
If you'd only reach out boy
And let me prove to you this feeling's real

'Cause I'd like to get to know you
But you've got to make your move
If you want it, then come and get it
Can't you see that I'm attracted
Baby don't keep holdin' back
Make your move, and make it soon
See what I'm sayin'

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh, oh
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh

Better check me out boy
'Cause I wanna know
Do you want to touch me (really want me)
Then let me know

So shy, so shy

I may appear to be shy
But I'm just a bit reserved
Waitin' for you to give the world
How you'll hold me and never scold me
Never, never scold me

'Cause I'd like to get to know ya
Baby make your move

Now I don't wanna lie
Yeah, I'm just a little shy

See what I'm sayin'
Don't be so shy...
