Heal this lonely heart
Living in the dark
With a special tender touch
Knowing to share would be much more than
Living day to day
Trying to find a way
To keep it together, whatever
You gave all yourself
So many times before
Left broken hearted
When they parted, yeah, yeah
I've been down that road
When you can't see up from down
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop pushin', pushin'

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop

In the morning light
You hold your pillow tight
Knowing to face another day
Is gonna take everything you've got to give
All so bitter
It's not the way you planned
You got to keep it together
No matter whatever
All those smiling faces
Who stabbed you in the back
You should be trying, instead of crying, hey, hey
Now is the time to hold your head up high
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop pushin', pushin'

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop
Everybody pushin'
Don't stop...

You gave all yourself
So many times before
Left broken hearted
When they parted, hey, hey
I've been down that road
When you can't see up from down
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop
Everybody pushin'
Don't stop...
