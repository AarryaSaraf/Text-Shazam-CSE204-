So long ago
So far away
Two hearts in love
And stars above
And make believe

As soft and slow
I sail away
Come back with me
Across the sea of memories

Do you remember
Those golden days
Come sail away
Come sail away

Where once my love
Upon a time
We fell in love
And taught the stars to shine

So long ago
So far away
But now and then
I sail again
To yesterday

The sun sets low
Upon the bay
So come and we
Will cherish every precious ray

Do you remember
Those golden days
Come sail away
Come sail away

So come my love
Let love be true
Remember me
As I remember you
