Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby just wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I've gotta spend
Long as I'm back with my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby just wrote me a letter

Well, he wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me anymore
Please, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more anyway

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-coming home
My baby, he wrote me a letter

I said my baby just wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter
My baby, he wrote me a letter

My baby, my baby
My baby, he wrote me a letter!

Well, he wrote me a letter
Said he couldn't live without me anymore
Please, can't you see
I've gotta get back to my baby once more anyway

Give me a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm coming home
My baby wrote me a letter
