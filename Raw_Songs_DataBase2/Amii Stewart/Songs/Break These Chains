In the darkness over night
In searches of love's delight
I'm talkin' with him for awhile
That's all around me
I can move it, I can spread
I'm hopeless and so weak
I'm searchin' somewhere, someone will find me

(Break, break these chains)
(Break, break these chains)

I need a place where I belong
Someone to call my own
Livin' with him without past form behind me
I give my body, mind and soul
No wishin' trendin' under control
To the wonder cut these ropes that now wind me

Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love
Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love

(Break these chains) Break these chains
(Break these chains)

Like a ship without a sail
No direction that's all frail
I'm searchin' for someone to guide me
No more longin' lonely nights
No solitary bights
No more with you're forever beside me

Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love
Break these chains around my heart
Break these chains around my heart
I want you, I need you
I need you my love

(Break these chains) Break these chains
(Break these chains)...
