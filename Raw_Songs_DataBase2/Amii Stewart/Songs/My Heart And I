My heart and I have wandered aimlessly
Beneath the weeping willow searching for the sun
Time after time we've met each other in a dream
And we have gazed upon the miracle of love

My heart and I have heard the angels sing
And we have found upon life's broken wing
And now we know that love is
Just another rainbow in the sky

Mother comfort us in thee we trust
Have mercy on my heart and I

My heart and I will know no happiness
As long as we see hate and bitterness
And like a child we close our eyes
Do not forsake us when we cry

Mother comfort us in thee we trust
Have mercy on my heart and I
