I love you like my life
But you always kiss the knife
I don't know why I stay
Your sayin' "Don't know why"
Always make me cry
Such a price to pay
It's easy to say knowin' you tie and go
It's easy just to cash in
You see me and I know that I'm still alone
No tellin' when we're gonna win

Take it easy on your love
Try to take it easy on your love
Easy on your love
Easily so easy to know
Are you ever gonna go?
Easy on your love

I love you all the way
Did I have to say
That all the passion was yesterday
The night is always like
When you turn on the lights
Shadows come out to play
It's easy just to hide all your alibis
It's easy just to cash in
Don't leave me on the time
And it's yours and mine
No tellin' when we're gonna win

Take it easy on your love
Try to take it easy on your love
Easy on your love
Easily so easy to know
Are we ever gonna go?
Easy on your love...
