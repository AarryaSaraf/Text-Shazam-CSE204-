I was only a child in your eyes
Just a girl for all seasons
With no deeper reasons
You were always the man in my eyes
I loved you until the magic flew away
Why should you think I'd always stay?
Why was I only a child in your eyes?

I was only a child in your eyes
How I wish that you'd made me
Feel like a lady
You were always the man in my eyes
I loved you, why did you let me slip away? (why did you let me slip away?)
And now you beg for me to stay
Could I be more than a child in your eyes?

Looked up to you, idolized
Now I see right through you
Realized I was a fool

Until the magic flew away (until the magic flew away)
Why should you think I'd always stay?
Until the magic flew away (magic, magic)
Why was I only a child in your eyes?
