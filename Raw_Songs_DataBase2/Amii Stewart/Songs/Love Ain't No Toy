Love ain't no toy, hey

Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it
Hmmm... Can you dig it, babe

How this is the whole make concern
This rap about to lay on you
Is about takin' my heart and money
And mess with my emotions
Now this can be very very dangerous
Now I don't know what you're bein' involved with
Talkin' 'bout my man
But this will kill you
Freaker than anything like drug stuff
Can you dig it

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

It ain't no toy, it ain't no toy
Love ain't no toy

I've been mounted, mounted, good to you
It's another way fact of toy
Even everything that you ask me to
Ain't it true
Still you when since you don't treat me bad
But you're gonna fool 'round and lose
The best things you ever had
Let me hear now

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Don't mean no faintly
When you come from
You know I can give, you gotta give it
Can you dig it
I don't know what your friends call ya
When you're out on the streets
Warn me you're passin' over
To me, your way nothin' but a lowdown
So just ride and good rings
And I ain't kickin' none, none, none, none, none
'Cause you ain't never gonna change
And I ain't never gonna stop complainin'
One thing, I wanna say to you
Never wouldn't, I'm sayin' to you

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy

Let me hear, let me hear
Gotta say you dig it
I wanna know, I wanna know now

Gotta give it, gotta give it
Gotta give it to me
Gotta give it, gotta give it
Gotta give it to me
Let me tell you 'bout

Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy
Let me hear now
Love ain't no toy, hey hey
If you make use it, other use it
Don't leave me
It can be this toy...
