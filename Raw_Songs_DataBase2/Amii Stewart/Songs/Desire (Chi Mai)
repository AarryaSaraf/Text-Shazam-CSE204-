Come, come into my arms
Lay down here beside me
Gently guide me
The pain and pleasure
I'm scared to you

A man by design
Perfect and divine
Lover lets cover each other with gladness
Come come and discover each other with wonder
Ah, lover let's cover each other with love

Oh, sweet passion
Cover me
Take me like the first time
Is a last time
Oh, gently open wide

Oh, my heart is on fire
Burning with desire
Lover lets cover each other with gladness
Come come and discover each other with wonder
Ah, lover let's cover each other with love

Love, love, love
Mmmm...
