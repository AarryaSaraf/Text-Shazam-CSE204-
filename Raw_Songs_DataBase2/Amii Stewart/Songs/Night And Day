Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon
Under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night, why's it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
