My man don't love me
Treats me oh, so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

But if you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home every day
Just treat me right, baby
And I'll stay home night and day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone
