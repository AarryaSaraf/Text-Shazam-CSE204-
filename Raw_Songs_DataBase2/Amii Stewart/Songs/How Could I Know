How long must we try?
Choke back on these words we chose
That part of me is taking over

Hold on to what you have
Let go of the things you hold
That part of me is taking over

I wanna believe
This will be over eventually
And I believe
This part of me is gone
And I've moved on

How could I know
Everything I've broken down so long ago?

Sing back, must we try?
React to this firefight
This part of me is taking over

I wanna believe
This will be over eventually
And I believe
This part of me is gone

How could I know?
Everything I've broken down so long ago
How could I know?
Everything I've broken down somewhere I know
I know

How long must we try?
To react to this firefight
How long must we try?
How long?

How could I know?
Everything I've broken down so long ago
How could I know?
Everything I've broken down somewhere I know
I know
