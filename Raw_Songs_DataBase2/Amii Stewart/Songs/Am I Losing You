Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?

I saw you yesterday
You're up with someone new
The things people say
Oh, tell me they're not true
Is she just a friend?
Or is this the end?
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?

It hurts to realize
I'm not the only one
Are you telling lies?
Am I a figure of fun?
I still got my pride
The tears I must hide
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Everybody thought we were good for each other
So did I
Until I saw you with her
And I would do anything for you
Except share

Is she just a friend?
Or is this the end?
Oh, what will I do?
Am I losing you?

Hoo-haa
Am I, am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
Am I, am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
I still got my pride
Hoo-haa
Hoo-haa
Am I losing you?
Hoo-haa
