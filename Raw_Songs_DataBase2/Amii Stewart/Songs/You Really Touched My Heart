I wandered down to your place
It won't be the same
Face to face, I look at you
But you turned away

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew that love could go so far (so capture the moments)
So capture the moments
Before it's all over with you

I'll walk away but it's hard
When you poke at me to stay
You can call out my name
But our love will never, never be the same

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew that love could go so far
Oh you, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
So capture the moments (capture the moments)
Before it's all over with you

Where did we go wrong
After love so long?
Where is the love I once knew?

Oh you, you know you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew-ooh-ooh
That love could go so far

(Capture the moments)
So capture the moments
Before it's all over (it's all over)
So capture the moments (it's all over)
Before it's all over

You, you know you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
I never knew, never knew, never knew
That love could go so far
You, you really touched my heart (you really touched my heart)
So capture the moments (capture the moments)
Before it's all over with you
