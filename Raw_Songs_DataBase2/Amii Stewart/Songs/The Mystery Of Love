A storm of passion in the night
I must be high on love
A touch of magic you delight
I must be high on love
My world's dreams are comin' true
I must be high on you
This is the night for me and you
So tell me all 'bout

(The mystery of love)
In the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answers in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Ooh, won't you teach me in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Tell me you're all 'bout the mystery of love

I hope this night will never end
I must be high on love
Against your touch, there's no defence
I must be high on love
You are my fate, you are my rescue
I must be high on you
This is the night for me and you
So tell me all 'bout

(The mystery of love)
In the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answers in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Ooh, won't you teach me in the middle of the night (The mystery of love)
Tell me you're all 'bout the mystery of love

(The mystery of love) In the middle of the night
(The mystery of love)
I'm lookin' for answer in the middle of the night
(The mystery of love) Teach me, teach me
(The mystery of love) Tell me all 'bout the mystery of love...
