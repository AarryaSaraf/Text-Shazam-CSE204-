Could Heaven be
This harmony
These two hearts beating as one
This true love we have begun
Forever and eternally
Sounds heavenly in love to me

Could Heaven be
Two stars at sea
Like angels of a feather
Do we belong together
Could Heaven be
This rhapsody in blue

Could Heaven be
So close to me
And you...
