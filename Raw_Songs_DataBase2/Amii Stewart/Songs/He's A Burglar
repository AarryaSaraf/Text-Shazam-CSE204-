He's a burglar
He broke into my mind
He's a burglar
Took everything he could find
He looked into my eyes
And knew I was defenseless
He stole a glance to my surprise
His charms they left me senseless

Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

He's a burglar
He stole my peace of mind
He's a burglar, yeah
I was fooled by his cool lies
Now I was standing helpless
Lost all of my control
He smiled at me with burnin' lips
And then he stole my soul

Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

He's a burglar
He never needs a key
He's a burglar
And he's still runnin' free
I held him in my arms
And heard him call my name
And while he sweet talked me
He paralysed my brain

He's a burglar
He broke into my mind
Oh, he's a burglar
Took everything he could find
Oh, he's a burglar
He broke into my mind

Burglar
He's a burglar
Burglar
Ooh, he's a burglar
Burglar
Broke into my mind
Burglar
Everything he could find
