Album: AStarIsBorn

// Black Eyes //

Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for lies
And everyone's waitin' for you

And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside
And I'm gone sittin' by the phone and I'm all alone by the wayside

By the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

Too far gone and I'm by the phone
And I'm all alone and I'm awful lonely by the wayside

I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside
I'm by the wayside

By the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside

I'm by the wayside
By the wayside
By the wayside

Black eyes open wide
It's time to testify
There's no room for lies
And everyone's waitin' for you
Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone's lookin' at you
Everyone's waiting for you
Everyone's waiting for you

// Somewhere Over The Rainbow (Dialogue) //

When all the world is a hopeless jumble
And the raindrops tumble all around
Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found

// Fabulous French (Dialogue) //

[Jackson Maine, Ramon & Shangela:]
Hey is this a drag bar?

Yeah, Papo, yeah, yeah, b-but, look we do this every Friday night. Yo it's crazy; it's so lit though

She used to work here as a server, but tonight, the only thing she's serving are some fabulous, French live vocals

// La Vie En Rose //

Des yeux qui font baisser les miens
Un rire qui se perd sur sa bouche
Voilà le portrait sans retouches
De l'homme auquel j'appartiens

Quand il me prend dans ses bras
Il me parle tout bas
Je vois la vie en rose

Il me dit des mots d'amour
Des mots de tous les jours
Et ça m'fait quelque chose

Il est entré dans mon cœur
Une part de bonheur
Dont je connais la cause

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie

Et dès que je l'aperçois
Alors je sens en moi
Mon cœur qui bat

(Would anybody like some French tips tonight?)

C'est lui pour moi, moi pour lui dans la vie
Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie
Alors je sens en moi
La vie en rose

// I'll Wait For You (Dialogue) //

[Ally & Jackson Maine:]
Why did you come back here?

Your friend brought me back here. I'm glad he did. Can I buy you a drink?

Oh I-I-I got to change and I-I got paint in my hair and-

I'll wait for you

Um, yeah, okay, sure
Yeah, if you wanna wait I'll come have a drink with you, sure

// Maybe It's Time //

Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change a man
Hell, it takes a lot to try
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die

Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Nobody knows what waits for the dead
Some folks just believe in the things they've heard and the things they read
Nobody knows what awaits for the dead

I'm glad I can't go back to where I came from
I'm glad those days are gone, gone for good
But if I could take spirits from my past and bring 'em here
You know I would
Know I would

Nobody speaks to God these days
Nobody speaks to God these days
I'd like to think he's lookin' down and laughin' at our ways
Nobody speaks to God these days

When I was a child, they tried to fool me
Said the worldly man was lost and that a Hell was real
Well I've seen Hell in Reno
And this world's one big old Catherine wheel
Spinnin' steel

Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
It takes a lot to change your plans
And a train to change your mind
Maybe it's time to let the old ways die
Oh, maybe it's time to let the old ways die

// Parking Lot (Dialogue) //

[Lady Gaga:]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Bradley Cooper:]
That me?

[Lady Gaga:]
That's you

[Bradley Cooper:]
Did you just write that now?

[Lady Gaga:]
Yeah

// Alibi //

Don't ask me 'bout tomorrow
Or tell me about my past
My heart is yours to borrow
Ain't nothing meant to last

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

Don't ask too many questions
You don't want answers to
You don't like my direction
Hell, I won't follow you

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin daddy
That I had to run away
Looked him in the eyes
Said there ain't no other way
So woman, if I tell you that I love you, be okay

'Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I love you in the morning
And when the day is done
But if you want my freedom
You know I'm bound to run

I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

I told my dyin daddy
That I had to run away
Looked him in the eyes
Said there ain't no other way
So woman, if I tell you that I love you, be okay

'Cause I ain't lyin'
I don't lie
Without an alibi

// Trust Me //

[Jackson Maine & Ally & Announcer:]
Thank you very much. Now isn't she great? There's a friend of mine who, uh, came a long way to be here, and she wrote a great song, and I'd just like her to sing it. I think it's pretty fucking good

How are you? You made it

I'm good, hi. How are you? It was so good

I was lucky to see you. Everything all right? The trip was fine?

Yeah

I did an arrangement that was kinda not so great, but, uh, maybe you can just take a-yeah, yeah, come on, here we go

-no I can't do that. I'm sorry. Jack, please, this is not fine. Jack, don't go for that

All you gotta do is trust me...

// Shallow //

[Bradley Cooper:]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Lady Gaga:]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Lady Gaga:]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha
Oh, ha, ah, ha

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

// First Stop, Arizona (Dialogue) //

[Lady Gaga:]
I don't feel this way about everybody

[Bradley Cooper:]
Well good, we're on the same page, you come sing with me

[Lady Gaga:]
Where?

[Bradley Cooper:]
Well, first stop's Arizona

// Music To My Eyes //

[Bradley Cooper:]
You're music to my eyes
I had to listen just to find you
I'd like for you to let me sing along
Give you a rhythm you feel

I wanna learn your every line
I wanna fill your empty spaces
I want to play the part to reach your heart
Sing you a song that you feel, oh

Love, let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music, baby
You're music to my eyes

[Lady Gaga:]
Your voice is quite a view
I heard a song and then I saw you
I learned the lyrics and knew you were mine
Dance the horizon with you

I wanna sing you a sunrise
And be the dawn I know will move you
I'd like to be the strings on your guitar
Touch me and play what you feel

[Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga:]
Love, let your music be mine
Sing while I harmonize
Let your melodies fly in my direction
Take me to your paradise
On a musical ride
I'm in love with your music, baby
You're music to my eyes

// Diggin' My Grave //

[Bradley Cooper:]
You're killin' me baby with the things you do
Put me in the ground before we're through
Burnin' up this town
Spendin' everythin' I've saved
Yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

[Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga:]
Every little lie you tell can't keep it hid
You're just another nail on my, my coffin lid
Someone else is gettin' all the love you never gave
Woo
Yeah
And you've been out all night
Diggin' my grave, yeah

So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
'Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black

Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

So keep on runnin' around
Ain't no need to hurry back
'Cause I'll be gone from here
And you'll be all dressed up in black
Woooo

Six feet under baby that's where I'll be
By the time that you're done with me
All these tears I cry
Drownin' in a tidal wave
Yeah yeah
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave
You've been out all night
Diggin' my grave

Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my
Diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave

// I Love You (Dialogue) //

Alright, listen to me, here's what we're gonna do
You're going to do the songs that I say that I wanted you to do, remember?
Please don't...
This is what I said, you promised me you were gonna do it
I don't wanna sing
I love you
I'll always remember us this way

// Always Remember Us This Way //

That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme
But damn we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Oh, yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

So when I'm all choked up
But I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way, way, yeah

When you look at me
And the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Oooh, oooh, hmmmm
Oooh, oooh, hmmmm

// Unbelievable (Dialogue) //

[Rez:]
Ally, that was unbelievable

[Ally:]
Thank you

[Rez:]
That was unbelievable, what you did out there

[Ally:]
Thank you

[Rez:]
I don't know if you know anything about me, about where I come from. I'm Rez Gavron

[Ally:]
I know who you are

[Rez:]
What you have right now goes way beyond just this. The question to you is, what do you want?

[Ally:]
I, I don't, I, I...
I gotta talk to Jack

// How Do You Hear It? (Dialogue) //

[Jackson:]
What are you writing down in here?

[Ally:]
I had this idea on the bike, and I don't wanna forget it

[Jackson:]
How do you hear it?

[Ally:]
La da da da da da da
Da da da
Da da da da da da da
Ba da da
Da da da da da da da

// Look What I Found //

One, two, three
I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle
I've been knocking 'em down

I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars
But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just laying on the ground

Under the foggy day
I'm looking for a light
And my only friend
Is working tonight

I can't get myself out of bed
Hear these voices in my head like a song
But look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what I found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just laying on the ground

When I met you I was blown to pieces
Heart all over the floor
Ever since you put me back together
I can't believe it won't believe it

Look what you found
Yeah baby
Look what I found
Someone who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Look what I found
Whoo! C'mon!
Look what I found
Somebody who loves me
Look what we found
Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Heart just laying on the ground

// Memphis (Dialogue) //

You come with me to Memphis

Rez wants to keep me here, because you know, they rushed out the single and they're so excited that they want me to finish the album, so I'm working on that

Listen to what you saying... listen to what you just said. People wanna hear what you have to say. That's the stuff right there

I-I-I can't...

Hey, hey, take it in

// Heal Me //

Treat me like your patient
Just don't keep me waiting
Or I'll just be wasted
In a crowd of the lonely
I need you to inspire me
When I can't inspire myself
I need you to provide for me
When I feel like someone else

Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah

Dose me with your energy
Leave your soul inside of me
Cool me down and calm me
Ring me, don't alarm me

Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down, touch my spirit, oh
Lay me down, lay me down now
Lay me down

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah

I wanna be more, or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed
I wanna be more, or equal, not less
I wanna be happy with someone
I wanna feel blessed

Heal me
God knows nothing else is gonna, gonna heal me
Oh, before it's too late
Won't you steal me?
Steal me all the way from myself
Won't you heal me?
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah
Heal me, ah

// I Don't Know What Love Is //

[Lady Gaga:]
I don't know what love is
If I can't have you here
I don't know what love is
I think that it's just fear

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
I don't know the tempo
Of my heart's concerto
It all seems like a dream
It's not, I know
There's something real out there for me

I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
(Every color I choose)
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

[Bradley Cooper:]
If I had the courage
I'd know just what to do
Sometimes I have to crawl
And everyday I fall
Tryin' just to stand by you

[Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper:]
I swear I've seen an angel
A paradise in blue
(Every color I choose)
But I don't know what love is
But I think it might be you

// Vows (Dialogue) //

When we gave our vows at the altar, I just didn't get to say everything I wanted to say, so I wrote it down and I brought it here. I hope it's okay if I love you forever, Jack

// Is That Alright? //

Life is so simple
A little boy, a little girl
Laughing and loving
Trying to figure out the world
It felt like summer
When I kissed you in the rain
And I know your story
But tell me again

Nothing you say wouldn't interest me
All of your words are like poems to me
I would be honored if you would take me as I am

I want you to look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me, to be by my side
I want you at the end of my life
I wanna see your face, when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

I hope you're still with me when I'm not quite myself
And I pray that you'll lift me when you know I need help
It's a warm celebration of all of our years
I dream of our story, of our fairy tale

Family dinners and family trees
Teaching the kids to say thank you and please
Knowing if we stay together that things will be right

I want you to look right in my eyes
To tell me you love me, to be by my side
I want you at the end of my life
I wanna see your face, when I fall with grace
At the moment I die
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?

// SNL (Dialogue) //

Alec in 10
(9, 8, 7, 6)
Ready 4, excuse all, 4
Alec in 5 seconds
(5, 4, 3, 2)
And go 4 (1)
Dissolve 4 and cue Alec

Ladies and gentlemen, Ally

// Why Did You Do That? //

Why do you look so good in those jeans?
Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?
You're making all my thoughts obscene
This is not, not like me
Why you keep on texting me like that? (damn)
Got other things I need my mind on, yeah
Other responsibilities
This is not, not like me

Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh

Boy, could you please stop being so fine?
When I stare at you I wish I were blind
'Cause I begin to lose control
No I can't, can't let go
'Cause ever since I met you I've been praying on my knees
That you would always stay around, that you would never leave
But I'm the kind of girl that always needs to be free
Why did you do that to me?

Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahhh, ahh-ahhh
Why did you do that? (Do that)

I can't stop talking about what you do to me
You keep keeping me from how I'm supposed to be
To be

Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
(Do that to me)
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that?
Do that to me (Oh why did you do that to me?
Why did you do that
Do that, do that, do that, do that to me?
(Why?)
Do that to me?
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that to me?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh (Oh, why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?
Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh, ahh-ahhh (Why did you do that?)
Why did you do that?

// Hair Body Face //

Hair, body, face
Hair, body, face

Your friends are in the other room
Heard every cruel thing they said
They're all just trying to be cool
So I wrote this song in my head
I'm not mad as long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes
Doesn't make a difference, yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes

'Cause baby when I look at you
I just don't know what to do with you
A man loves a triple threat
Did the party room just see that?
Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya
Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat

Tryna leave here, but you won't let me leave

Hair, body, face for you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat, do it, for ya)
For you
(Hair, body, face, for you, triple threat)

Wasn't the "it" girl at school (not me)
No, I wasn't queen at the prom
But don't take me for a fool
Now I know I've got my own charm
I'm not mad as long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes
Doesn't make a difference, yeah
As long as I am perfect in your eyes, your eyes

'Cause baby when I look at you

// Scene 98 (Dialogue) //

[Jackson:]
And you know why? 'Cause you're too worried about what everybody else is thinkin'.
[Ally:]
Here we go
[Jackson:]
You can't even concentrate on one fuckin' thing. That's right.
[Ally:]
Here we go, Jack, you want me to be your dad and be your drinking buddy?
[Jackson:]
Yeah. You couldn't be my dad if you fuckin' tried. He had more talent in his fuckin' finger than you have in your whole fuckin' body, so don't even go there about that, all right? That's over the fuckin' line

[Ally:]
Why don't you have another drink, and we can just get fucking drunk until we fuckin' disappear, okay? Hey, do you got those pills in your pocket?

[Jackson:]
You're just fuckin' ugly, that's all

[Ally:]
Hey you got—I'm what?

[Jackson:]
You're just fuckin' ugly

[Ally:]
Get the fuck out! Get out! I said, "Get out!"

// Before I Cry //

I can't believe the things you said
Right now I wish that you would try
Try to stay near me
Try to be near me
Before I cry
'Cause I am gonna need a well
To catch the pain and lift the spell
Like you won't hear me
Can you try and heal me?
Before I cry

Hurry up, hurry up
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Before I change my mind

'Cause I'm gonna cry
If you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it
Why don't you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

Could you please find another way?
I start to think that I'm insane
Trying to stay here
Let me just lay here
Before I cry

Hurry up, hurry up
Before I lose you
Hurry up, hurry up
Before you lose me too
Hurry up, hurry up
Before I change my mind

'Cause I'm gonna cry
If you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it
Why don't you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry

I'm 'bout to lose it
It's got so confusing
Am I just repeating myself?
Say something loving to me before I crumble
Tell me, tell me, tell me

'Cause I'm gonna cry
If you say you don't need me
I'm gonna cry if you act like you don't care
Promise me, baby, you know I can't fake it
Why don't you hold me?
Tell me you love me
Before I cry
Before I cry
Before I cry

Have I said what I needed to say?
Have you said what you wanted to say?
Did you say what you wanted to say?
Would you try and stop me before I cry?

// Too Far Gone //

Please don't tell me I'm too far gone
I can't go on if I ain't living in your arms
Please don't tell me I'm too far gone
I can't go on if I ain't living in your arms
Please don't tell me I'm too far gone

Set me free, oh, oh
Set me free, yeah, eh
Set me free, oh, oh

// Twelve Notes (Dialogue) //

[Bobby:]
Jack talked about how music is essentially 12 notes between any octave. Twelve notes, and the octave repeats. It's the same story, told over and over, forever. All any artist can offer the world is how they see those 12 notes. That's it. Hmm.

He loved how you see them

[Ally:]
Thank you for being here tonight to honor my husband. He wrote a song for me. I'd like to sing it for him tonight. And with your help, maybe I can. Thank you. Really, thank you.

// I'll Never Love Again (Film Version) //

[Lady Gaga:]
Wish I could 
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you

If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryna to save a part of you

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh, oh

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you, ooh

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
Baby unless they are your lips

[Bradley Cooper:]
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again
Never love again
Oh I'll never love again

// I'll Never Love Again (Extended Version) //

Wish I could, I could've said goodbye
I would've said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew, it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again, ooh

When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself
Lying in your arms
And I want to pretend that it's not true
Oh baby, that you're gone
'Cause my world keeps turning, and turning, and turning
And I'm not moving on

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love

I don't wanna know this feeling
Unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment, ooh
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you, ooh

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
Baby, unless they are your lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
Oh, I'll never love again

Love again
Oh, I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I won't, I won't, I swear I can't
I wish I could but I just won't
I'll never love again
I'll never love again, oh
