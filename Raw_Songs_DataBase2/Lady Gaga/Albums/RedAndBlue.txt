// Something Crazy //

Wait, I think it's time
Your fire's lit and so is mine
Go turn out the light
Don't be afraid
Tonight's the night

And I won't, I won't try to change you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

Boy, we're almost there
I'll lay your clothes over my chair
Pull the shades down low
We're both ready to lose control

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
And I feel so down when you're not around

And I won't, I won't try to tame you
But I will, I will if you want me to
Yeah, it always brings me down when you're not around
I still need you

Oh, you do something for me, baby
And I cannot control it lately
You do something for me
Oh, you do something for me baby
And I cannot control it, baby
You do something for me
Oh, you do something crazy to me
And I cannot control it, baby
La la la la la la la la
You always bring me down

// Wish You Were Here //

It's funny how things, they change
The clouds they part
Rearrange for me
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see

Where is home?
I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free
'Cause, yeah, this room is crowded, but I am so alone in it
Help me, please

Where is home?
I want you to know

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

And I will be strong
I won't give in
I won't deny you
I know where we've been
I'm so much more than all of my fears
Than all of these tears
My tears, yeah

I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Where is home?
I want you to know
Oh, yeah

That I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

// No Floods //

I never ever thought I'd live away
From everybody that I love and say goodbye
Now I'm the princess of a downtown train
Where everybody here, they know my game
But when I walk down the street I hear them say
"There she goes, that crazy girl
She thinks she's something in this world."
So I'mma close my ears and dream 'cause life is never really what it seems
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
Yeah, you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

On every street there is a memory
A time and place where we can never be again, uh-uh-uh-oh
Street lights glow red, green and yellow too
Do you let signs tell you what to do?
Yeah, when you say stop, be sure that I'll say "go"
To the stars and land
Fire can't burn these hands
But I just close my eyes and dream
You can't deny me, my strong mean
Hey
In every mystery, there's a truth
You know I'm telling, I'm telling you, uh-uh

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

Go ahead and don't believe
'Cause everyone needs a way to breathe, and love, and dream
And you can't stop me
You can't stop me

No matter lightning or thunder
Buckets of rainwater
You can't flood this town
In a world unknown, you've got to hold your own
And you can't stop me
You're never, ever, ever gonna stop me now

I never ever thought I'd live away from everybody that I love and say goodbye

// Red And Blue //

One, two
I think I love you
You got ripped jeans
I'm only nineteen, what do you wanna do?
You got your cigarette
I got my headset
We're two of a kind
You're spades, and I'm diamonds
And you know that you

Yeah, you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Don't shoot
My heart is on mute
Our physical dreams are only skin deep
How do you wanna groove?
Bang, bang
D'you hear my gun ring? (Oh, yeah)
You're mine, you're there, you'll hear that
I am all up inside your head

Now you can see clearly that I am the one you want
But I must admit that I'm everything you're not

Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I cut lines, you wait you turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

You won't forget me when I'm gone
This feels so good, it can't be wrong
I'd recommend a one night stand
I know we're just friends, but you're my kind of man
Just for tonight
Just for tonight
Just for tonight

Even though I'm red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
I know we could be great for tonight
When you're cold, I'll make it burn
You'll never have to wait your turn
Yeah, I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, I am red, you are blue
I'm old school and you're so new
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
When you're cold, I like to burn
I'll cut lines, you'll wait your turn
But I guess I could forgive you tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight

// Words //

I won't break down today
Another brick's in my way of shadows
The promises they made
Regret themselves, and say "this is too hard"

Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

Whenever you're afraid, or someone's far away
Never give in
'Cause happily we'll reign when consequences change
Believe you can win

Yeah, they say you grow when you don't succeed
But it's hard to breathe when no one believes in me

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone

So let the sound bring me back
Sounds have no regrets
And before you know it

I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Your words, and be gone
Right to the stars and beyond
Your words, and be gone
I'll take your words, and be gone
Your words and be gone
Your words and be gone
I'll take your words and be gone
