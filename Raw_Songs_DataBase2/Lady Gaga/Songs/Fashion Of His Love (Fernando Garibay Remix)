Love

I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
