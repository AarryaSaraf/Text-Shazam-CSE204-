Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?
Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool


Just when you think
You're chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My my, what have we here?
What a surprise, what a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy
Nothing comes for free
Sniffing on a flower
Run through an autumn shower
I'm better off with someone else like me
Me

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, what a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

And I could fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all the leaves from a tree
If there's a quest I'm a knight
Where's there's wrong I'll do right
Two is better than the one I used to be

Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, what a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
Oh my my, what have we here?
What a surprise, what a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello, hello!
Hello, hello, hello, hello!
