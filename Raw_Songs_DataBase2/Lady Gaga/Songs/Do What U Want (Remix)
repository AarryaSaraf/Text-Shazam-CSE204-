Oh, yeah yeah
Oh, oh whoa
Oh

I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want about me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body


My bones hurt, ahh, from all the shows, mmm
But I don't feel the pain, 'cause I'm a pro
I, I sink in, then I'm okay
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage, hey


So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go (Ah-ha)
I would fall apart (Apart) if you break my heart (Ooh)
So just take my body, and don't stop the party
Yeah

You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
(Do what you want, do what you want)
Do what you want with my body (Oh)
You can't stop my voice (My voice) 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body (Do what you want with me)
Do what you want with my body (Woo, oh)

Do what you want with me
What you want, Lady Gaga
What you want with me, Christina
Oh, what you want with my body
Do what you want with me
Oh, what you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now

Do what you want with my body
