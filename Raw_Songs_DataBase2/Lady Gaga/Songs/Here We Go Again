Red One, Pixie

All my friends are going out
But I've been thinking
Maybe I better stay in bed

The ceiling's spinning 'round
Like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head

Boom boom boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there

I sleep through the alarm
Head under pillow
I know I'm gonna pay for this

I can't stand missing out
So when you call me, call me
I say okay if you insist

Boom boom boom
I need my medicine
And the cure ain't aspirin

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no)
I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there

Never wanna stay I wish I was there
Never wanna stay I wish I was there
Never wanna stay I wish I was there

I don't care about tomorrow
Here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance floor
When this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
I don't even care (no), I don't even care (no)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I've been there
