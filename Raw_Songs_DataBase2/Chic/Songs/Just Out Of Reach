I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
You keep it just out of reach

She arrives all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
Oh but soon, soon the tears will swell
Makin' it here seems such a cinch
But soon she'll smell the stench
Of the gutter-dwellers, them pretty fellows

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine

I sit alone and wonder why
Sweet love just pass me by
Is there someone out there who wants to try
I'll protect you, girl I never will neglect you
Just slip on this ring and
I will make your heart sing, my love

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
You keep it just out of reach

I want a love that's mine all mine, all the time
You keep it just out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine

I want a love that's mine all mine
But you keep it out of reach
I want a love that's mine all mine
But you keep it out of reach
