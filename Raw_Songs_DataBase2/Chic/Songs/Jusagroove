Life going nowhere
Lost, you don't care
Got no job, no money
No love and got no honey

Bills are growing through the roof
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove

Jusagroove, baby

Look before you leap
Think before you speak
Loose lips sink ships
Head trips could make you slip

So be cool, don't be a fool
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove

Jusagroove, baby

Just shoot your best shot
It might hit the spot
But don't lose your cool
Because life should be, jusagroove

Life going nowhere
Lost, you don't care
Got no job, no money
No love and got no honey

Bills are growing through the roof
Tell you what you gotta do
Max to the max, it's jusagroove
