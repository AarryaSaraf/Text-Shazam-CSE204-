Boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching

It's like I can't remember
You lost me in the orbit light
Your alchemy is my answer
And I'm hopin' it will heal me

Look into the white light
Palm trees and a sugar high
Lose me through the white light, yeah
Palm trees and a sugar high

Lose your shit and boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Feel good and boogie all night, yeah
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching

There ain't nobody else
Who can slide upon you, nice, like this
I could be all by myself
And I'm hopin' you will will heal me

Look into the white light
Palm trees and a sugar high
Lose me through the white light, yeah
Palm trees and a sugar high

Lose your shit and boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Feel good and boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Ooh, just boogie all night
Ooh, just boogie all night

This time
Gonna let go and surround you
This time
Surrender to the world

Lose your shit and boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Feel good and boogie all night
Like nobody's watching
We don't care who's watching
Ooh, just boogie all night
Ooh, just boogie all night
Boogie all night
Boogie all night
