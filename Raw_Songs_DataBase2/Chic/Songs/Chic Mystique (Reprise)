Get down and get up, groove me, work me
That's the move, sure can't hurt this beat
Forget your problems, groove will solve them
D-A-N-C-E with me

Yo, straight up and down
The Chic Mystique, a force that's driving
Once you get caught there's no surviving
The base and rhythm that gets you to move
Get into the Chic Groove

Come on, let's go, grab me, turn me
You got the moves, so smooth, body heat
Digging your style, so penetrating
