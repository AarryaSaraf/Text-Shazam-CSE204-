I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I'm exposed to your love
And I feel so susceptible
My resistance is low
'Cause you're oh so incredible

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

When you do your dance
The magic intensifies
I'm like putty in your hands
When you take me so deep inside

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on 

I'm exposed to your love
And I feel so susceptible
My resistance is low
'Cause you're oh so incredible

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

I feel your love coming on
Just like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over
