When you want someone
You're like a child at play
And when you need someone
It's such a lonely game
But when you love someone
The sun shines just for you
When you love someone
Your heart it lights up too

When you want someone
It's neither here nor there
And when you need someone
The pain's too much to bear
But when you love someone
It's like Shangri-La around you
When you love someone
There's the beauty that surrounds you

When you want someone
You look and think how nice
And when you need someone
You feel like you're gonna die
But you can be so happy

When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone
When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
Thank God I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
Thank God I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine for me so very bright

When you love someone

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright

Oh stars come out tonight
And shine so very bright
I love someone
I love someone...
