Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

As always just when the feeling's right
You give your lovin' to me
And hold me tight, my life
You still get filled with pain
Until I meet you Monday
And learn to love again, oh

Oh little girl I'm talkin' to you
Just tryin' to tell you I love you too

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

I think you're perfect as you are in my life
You're my shining star
Oh girl, don't ever leave me alone
Stay with me baby, you know I need you so

Hey little girl I'm talkin to you
Just tryin' to tell you I love you too

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

Sharing love, take a look around you
Ain't nothing better
Sharing love, so glad I found you
Ain't nothing better

Sharing love, take a look around you...
