I loved you more than words could tell
Oh I loved you more than words
Seems like we all live
All alone for ourselves
Seems like we all live for ourselves
But how can we say "live"
When these hearts of ours can't give
Any love to the ones
That you hold so very dear

I loved you more than words could say
Oh I loved you more than words
If you see the stains
When you look at my face
If you see the stains on my face

Tears are not only bad
Sometimes they come when I'm glad
And I'm glad when I think
Of the love that we had

Now I know you've known
Other lost souls like me
That lived their lives
In search of peaches and cream
If all this cold world
Has to offer are dreams
Rescue me, oh please, oh please

I loved you more
