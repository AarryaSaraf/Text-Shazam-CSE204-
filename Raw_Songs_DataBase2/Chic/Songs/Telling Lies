Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

You're just like Pinocchio
Every time you tell one
Now you know it grows
Why don't you stop this foolishness
I can't tolerate any more of this
Now you know it's late
You keep tellin' me lies, I'm on ice

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Runnin', hidin', slippin', slidin'
Always abidin' by your own rules
You won't win, you'll find there's no escape
You can't run this time
This time you'll pay for your crime
All I want is the truth but you keep on

Telling lies is your hobby
And you don't give a damn about the truth

Why won't you, why won't you
Why won't you try to tell the truth
