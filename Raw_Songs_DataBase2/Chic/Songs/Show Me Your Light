How me your light, your light
Me your light, your light
Love light burnin' in your heart
Let it shine on me
Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three

Show me your light, your light
Me your light, your light
You know love's broken
'Cause I'm tellin' you
Pandora's box is open, be cool

Don't mind when they put me down
'Cause now I'm in tune
I'll never, never be a clown or fool

Love light burnin' in your heart
Let it shine on me
Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three

Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three
Say love light, your loving light
Hey love light, your light
