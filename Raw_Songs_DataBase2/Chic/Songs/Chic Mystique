Get down and get up, groove me, work me
That's the move, sure can't hurt this beat
Forget your problems, groove will solve them
D-A-N-C-E with me

The Chic Mystique, a force that's driving
There is no surviving
The base and rhythm makes you move
Get into the Chic Groove

Come on, let's go, grab me, turn me
You got the moves, so smooth, body heat
Digging your style, so penetrating
Ooh, captivating me

The Chic Mystique, the sound you hear
Makes it very clear
Starts your heart pulsate
I know you can't wait

The Chic Mystique is music madness
Once you start you'll be glad
This cut is jumping and you'll be pumping sweat
You ain't heard nothing yet, just

Chic is the jam and Chic rolls and rattles
Dance to the floor, cattle
Stepping, sweating and let your hair down
Because of a Chic sound
