You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

Every time I see you
I surrender
To a feeling never known

Every time I hear you
Speak so tender
You break my heart of stone

So I learned
These words of wisdom
From one who's a cut above

You said with all your passion
In them
When you live true life
You love, true love

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

Comforting as sunshine in my window
At the end of a rainy night
Awaken from a dream that echoes
Everything's all right

Something special happened to me
I've fallen under your spell
You've shown me how good it can be
So I might as well, kiss and tell

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

So many roads I've travelled
And wandered where I've been
Here and there
Everywhere

On the outside looking in
The future is uncertain
You can't guarantee tomorrow

But wichever the way the wind blows
In my heart
I'll always know, I'll always know
You're my one and only one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You're my one
(One and only)
One and only one
You're my one

You know you're my one
My only one
You're second to none

You're my one
You're
You're second to none, baby

Oh, my baby
