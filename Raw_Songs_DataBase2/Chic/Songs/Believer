Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

When this cold world gets to me
I throw my fears out the door
Strong as Mr. T

Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

When I'm out on the street
I use cat-like decisions
To keep me on my feet

Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

You must go on with the show
Even when you're running on empty
That's just how it goes
It's always up to you, always up to you
Believer, believer

Stand back to back
Meet head to head
Fight toe to toe
And dance cheek to cheek
