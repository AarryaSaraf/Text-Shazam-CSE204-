There was a little girl
Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seems
Her happiness she lost
A broken 
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on

When she turns sweet sixteen
A boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss
That felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another 
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your think must gone
You still carry on
Oh, girl, you're a queen
If you just believe
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on

She became a happy wife
Whose husband called her queen
And she believed her life
Was perfect as can be
And when a surprise the walls came down
She rebelled and 
The mirror now reveals
What she can finally see

Woman, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on
You're a queen
If you just believe

You still carry on
Even if the love's gone

You're a queen
Yes, you know that you are
Even when love's gone
You still carry on
...

Woman, you're a queen
