Album: Believer

// Believer //

Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

When this cold world gets to me
I throw my fears out the door
Strong as Mr. T

Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

When I'm out on the street
I use cat-like decisions
To keep me on my feet

Stand back-to-back believer
Meet head to head
Fight toe-to-toe, believer
Dance cheek to cheek

You must go on with the show
Even when you're running on empty
That's just how it goes
It's always up to you, always up to you
Believer, believer

Stand back to back
Meet head to head
Fight toe to toe
And dance cheek to cheek

// You Are Beautiful //

(Oh, you are beautiful
You're beautiful to me, baby)

Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful

Life could be so tender, don't you know?
Like it was, remember, long ago
My cards are on the table, at a glance
Unlike Clark Gable (Frankly, my dear) I give a damn

Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful

Although I might be reachin' for a star
Even when I'm sleepin', dreamin', sneakin', thinkin': there you are
I feel like a million bucks when you're around
I hold my head so high up, like somewhere in the clouds

Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful

(Oh, you are beautiful
Beautiful)

You're beautiful to me, baby
You, you
You, you

You're beautiful to me, baby
You, you
You, you are beautiful

Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful
Oh, you are beautiful, you are beautiful

Oh, you, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful

You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful
You, you are beautiful, you, you are beautiful

// Take A Closer Look //

Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love

Ooh, Baby

You think love is an open door
You come and go when you want to score
You take my love, then you run away
Denyin' yourself another sunny day
Just stay and see the night through
We'll make love in the mornin' new
It's time that we settle down
No better love can be found

Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love

Well now you see that there's more to me
I want the love that you've kept from me
In return I'll share my love with you
So tell me what you're gonna do

Listen, baby, here's your last chance
Please give my love a second glance
'Cause lovin' you brings such happiness
A new thrill with each caress

Take a closer look at my love
Take a closer look at my love
I'm sure that you're gonna see
Our love will last an eternity
Take a closer took at my love
[x4]

// Give Me The Lovin' //

Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'
Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'

Take it easy
You been teasing me all night
Can't wait to please you
You know I'll do it right
Baby, I'm warning you
Might get a little rough
You better grab me
And hold on tight

Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'
Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'

You're gonna pay, oh
For making' me wait
Shy as a boy
On his first date
Give me the love I want
Give it to me now
No more games
No time to hesitate

Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'
Give me the lovin', come on
Give me the lovin'

I want to, I want to, I want to be possessed
I want to, I want to, I want to be caressed
I need to, I need to, I need to be owned
I need to, I need to, I need to be shown

Give me, give me
The lovin', the lovin'
Come on, come on
Give me the lovin', give me the lovin'
[Repeat till end]

// Show Me Your Light //

How me your light, your light
Me your light, your light
Love light burnin' in your heart
Let it shine on me
Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three

Show me your light, your light
Me your light, your light
You know love's broken
'Cause I'm tellin' you
Pandora's box is open, be cool

Don't mind when they put me down
'Cause now I'm in tune
I'll never, never be a clown or fool

Love light burnin' in your heart
Let it shine on me
Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three

Now that my love's torn apart
Broken one, two, three
Say love light, your loving light
Hey love light, your light

// You Got Some Love For Me //

You got some love for me
I got some love for you
It is not hard to see
What you can make me do
I ask you why you act so shy

// In Love With Music //

I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh

I sit night and day
Just singin' my life sway
And every mornin' when I get up
Before I fill my cup,
I sing my melody
Sounds so good to me
Dancin', singin'
Feels so good to me, damn

I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh

I'm havin' a love attack
Feels so good, matter of fact
My music, and you, boy
You make my dreams come true
Got me singin' a pretty melody
Dancin', singin'
Feels so good to me, that

I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm telling you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh
I'm tellin' you
Oh I love my music, yeah
Never want to lose it, oh

// Party Everybody //

Party Everybody
Feel the music in your body
I said party everybody
Feel the music right down in your body

Come in, but don't take a seat
Get on the floor, feel your body heat
Pretty ladies, their bodies shakin'
It's all there for the taking
Do it, do it, do it to the top
'Cause it feels so good, don't wanna stop
Just when I thought it about to die
Boom pops a party right in your eye

Party, ha, everybody
Feel the music right down in your body
Come on, we say party p-p-party, everybody
Feel the music down in your body

I says hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party, baby, everywhere I go
Let the music take control
'Cause it will move your very soul
People may stop and stare
But they don't know that you're doin' it everywhere
Come alive, y'all and rock it out
Let me hear everybody shout

And say party, p-p-p-party, everybody
Feel the music right down in your body
Come on and say party, p-p-party, everybody
Feel the music right down in your body

And say hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party everywhere I go
Hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party everywhere I go
Come on we say hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party, baby, everywhere I go
Hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party, baby, everywhere I go

Says a bicoastal man hangin' out in Cali
Met a little pretty girl
Straight from the Valley
And she said, Like totally awesome, for sure
On a sun bleached beach, bikini out of reach
I saw a cigarette flyin' through the air
I couldn't hardly stand her
The crazy young commander
Because I'm on the shore way over here
But hi, ho, don't you know
There's a party everywhere I go
I said hi hi hi, ho
Oh there's a party here everywhere I go
One more time, y'all
(There's a party everywhere I go)
Just when I thought it about to die
Boom boom, popped the party right in your eye

Swish, all net

Party everybody
Feel the music down in your body
Well come on and say party, p-p-party, everybody
Feel the music right down in your body
Say party, p-p-party, everybody
Well feel the music right down in your body
Well come on and say party, p-p-party, everybody
Feel the music down in your body
(Party everybody, feel the music in your body)
Say party p-party, everybody, boom boom
Feel the music right down in your body
Come on, we say party, p-party, everybody
Feel the music right down in your body
(Party everybody) Everybody
Feel the music right down in your body
