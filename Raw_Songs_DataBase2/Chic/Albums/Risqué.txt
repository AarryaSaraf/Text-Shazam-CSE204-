// Good Times //

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for making friends
Let's get together, how 'bout a quarter to ten?
Come tomorrow, let's all do it again

Boys will be boys, better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls, cute ponytails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporty life

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool, you can't change your fate

Let's cut the rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clams on the half shell and roller-skates, roller-skates

Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

Good times

Good times
These are the good times
Our new state of mind
These are the good times

// A Warm Summer Night //

Papi, could you love me, tonight?
On a warm summer night.
It would be so nice tonight.

// My Feet Keep Dancing //

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

I need some help, I get beside myself
And I got so many things in life to do
Like, reach for a star
Or maybe shoot ten under par
I'd like to do it all before I'm through
Fly into space, or maybe save the human race
All these things seem so appealing
But I'll never get the chance
'Cause all I do is dance
My mama said my brains are in my feet

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

Papa told me
Every night when he would scold me
He knew I'd never make him very proud
So I ran away from home to live all alone
And make myself a stand-out in the crowd
Then it hit, my ideas began to fit
I had to be what I was meant to be
Now my name is up in lights
And I hoof here every night
They were right
My brains are in my feet

Dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing
My feet keep dancing, dancing, dancing

// My Forbidden Lover //

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

I fell in love and I didn't want to do it 'cause I knew
That your love wasn't true
You try to hide that sinister appearance
And the lies, those alibis

You'll give your love to anyone who asks, yes, you do
And I know that it's true
But still I care and I want to see you there
When I need, yes, indeed you are

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

I can't resist that very strong urge to have you, dear
Oh, please come here
Just let me love you any time and any place we dare
We'll just let them stare

You want to love everybody and everything you can
You're the typical man
Yet still and all I'm at your beck and call
When you need, yes, indeed you are

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My love is forbidden
We keep our love hidden
My love is forbidden
We keep our love hidden

My love is forbidden
We keep our love hidden
My love is forbidden
We keep our love hidden

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

My forbidden lover

// Can't Stand To Love You //

Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe

Surprise baby, here I am
I'd like to have a few words with you
Just to talk about all of these things
That you put me through
Oh no daddy, she can stay
For once in our lives
We can get a straight story
Little punk, do it for me
Or I'll number your days

Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe

I know that you are a sneak
You do these things behind my back
You could try to be discreet
I let you go
Now you think I'm a sap
The way that you treated me
You'd think I were into S&M
I can't deal with it
You won't get away with it

Every night I pray
Can't stand to love you
And every night and day
I can't stand to love you babe

// Will You Cry //

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?

Love is pain and pain could pleasure
If you would have only realized
And now it's your turn to cry
The camel's back broke tonight
It's too late to try

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?

Tears roll down my cheeks and
You were never around to wipe my eyes
For years you played hide-and-seek
With my love
You are just that kind of guy

When you hear this song will you cry?
'Cause you know you're wrong
Will you cry?

// What About Me //

Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see
Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see

Loving you somehow I feel cheated
I ask is this the way to be treated
You take what you want
Then you stroll out the door contented
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me

Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see
Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see

When we first met I thought we were gonna be
The greatest love of all time
Oh what a fantasy
I put faith in you and you shattered my dreams completely
Used me, abused me
Knocked down and walked all over me

Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see
Now you got yours what about me
I gave my love don't you see
