// 1,000 Years //

I'll live forever, I'll never be filled
I'll never imagine I can change what I killed
I destroy what I love, I drain what is filled
And I live by the heart of the things I kill

I will be alive for a thousand years
This memory will never leave, this body won't die
This body is a temple stolen from the Lord
I'll walk in his shadow for a thousand years

This is the gift I was given at birth
I'll walk in your shadow for a thousand years
One thousand years

// Blind //

Now some of us are weak
And some endure
And some people live their life
In violence that's pure and clean

But I saw a man cry once
Down on his knees
In the corner of a darkened cell
And his pain meant nothing to me

But I was younger then
And young men never die
When I walked out in the sun
I was strong
Clear-minded and blind

I don't say prayer for anyone
It doesn't do any good
Please don't ask me questions
They'd just be misunderstood

And if you could step inside me
And feel what hatred brings
And if you saw with my eyes
You'd see what self-deception means

I was younger once
And I created a lie
And though my body was strong
I was self-deluded
Confident and blind

Now show some pity
For weak of will
Because when we're drinking
We can never be filled

Show some understanding
For the lonely fool
Because when I'm drinking
I'm out of control

I was never young
Nothing has transpired
But when I look in the mirror
I feel dead
I feel cold 
I am blind

I am blind
I am blind
I am blind

// Come Out //

Come on, don't hide. I want you. I want you
So come on out, come on out, come on out
This is what you'll get, this is what you'll get,
I'll make it what you want. I'll make it what you want.
I'll make it what you want.
I'll use it on you, girl, I'll use it on you, girl,
So come on out, come on out, come on out,
I'll make sure I'll make sure I'll pull the trigger
Don't tell me I ain't got the right

// Feel Happiness //

(Shhhhhhhh)
I'm truly sorry,
For what I never did,
But I forgive you, too;
For your indifference.
You're a lonely child,
Laid open to the world,
And when I looked in your eyes
I saw myself there too,
So please forgive me now,
For what we never had,
Although its useless to say,
I wish you happiness.
I wish you happiness,
I wish you happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness...

// I Want To Be Your Dog //

So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
Now we're gonna be face to face
And I lay right down in my favorite place
And now I want to be your dog
And now I want to be your dog
And now I want to be your dog
Well, come on
And now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
And now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart on the burning sand
And now I want to be your dog
And now I'm gonna be your dog
And now I want to be your dog
Well, come on

// Love Will Tear Us Apart //

When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed, our respect runs so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Is it something so good, just can't function no more

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

// No Cruel Angel //

The bridge is long and narrow
the hills are burned by sorrow
the black crow died of blackness
the moon gave up his madness
but when two hearts like ours return
to the open sea
no arm can pull us down
no angel beneath the water
can never pull us under
some eyes can seal no secrets
but time erodes a surface
a snake swims the ocean
in an earth that turns for no one
but when two minds like ours dream
in an open sea
no steel door can close us in
no cruel angel at the gate
will ever seal our fate
the bridge is long and narrow
the hills drown in sorrow
the black crow died of blackness
the moon gave up his madness
but when two hearts like ours return
to the open sea
but when two minds like ours dream
in an open sea
no cruel arm can pull us down
no steel door can close us in
no angel beneath the water
will ever take us under
in an open sea
we're in an open sea
in an open sea

// Not Alone //

In separate sections,
The bodies fall.
The leaves are purple,
The grass is red.
I love your music.
I love your style.
The light inside you
Leaks through your eyes.
Na na na na....

The golden liquid
That washed your face,
Contain my secrets
And bitter taste.
I love your music.
I love your throat.
The light inside me
Feeds like a golden rope.
Na na na na...

And I alone,
See through your eyes.
And I alone,
Will never die.
And I alone,
Can taste your hand.
And I alone,
Am sanctified.
And I alone,
Can smell your hair.
And I alone,
Feed you the air.
And I alone,
Can steal steal your breath,
And I alone,
Prevent your death.
And I alone,
Am not alone.
And I alone,
Am not alone...
Na na na na na...

It's the sun
It's the sun
Sh-sh-shining
Sh-sh-shining...
Shhhh....
Shhhh....

// Picture Of Mary Ann //

These are the hands
that hold the sun
this is the water
where our life was first begun

these are the eyes
that saw you lying there

And this is the mind
that will always remember

I hold your hand 
with a heavy heart of lead
the sky is black and gold
and the moon is shining red

I see you Mary Anne
but I'm not really here

I see you Mary Anne
what have I become?

This is the sound
of a world without a name
and here is the ocean
where history was raised
and I was a young man
sailing on the sea
and this was a new world
and every child was free

No we're not standing here
on the poison shore

Love is the empty place
where loneliness is born

I see you Mary Anne
We never knew ourselves

I see you Mary Anne

We're not really here

I see yourÂ [?] (anyone know?)

What have we become?

// Was He Ever Alive //

When I die let me down,
In the field in the ground,
Where the water runs beneath me,
And the sky's red and falling down.
Round my eyes that I closed,
And the world that I know,
Is a shadow of a dream,
That left me in my loneliness,
Without a life behind me,
That I can say I ever knew,
That I can say I ever knew,
That I can say I ever lived at all.

Now I'm a drunken man,
And I'm killing time,
From what was mislaid.
I've never been alive,
I was never born in blood.
I've never breathed a word,
And the people that I knew,
The women and the thieves,
They left my body bleeding,
On this piece of fallow ground.
They left my body bleeding,
On this piece of closing in.
They left my body bleeding,
On this piece of emptiness.

They left my body bleeding,
on this piece of fallow ground,
Where famine comes before me,
And cuts my people down.
Where the brown cloud shuts the sun,
And locusts eat our food,
And the blood of lamb is spilled,
And smeared across the altar,
And the colors red and gold,
Put their flavor in our soul.
And the children are born blind,
And the water turns to blood,
And we're sheltered by our god,
Who's hand is strong and bloody.
And we're walking earth that's filled,
With the bodies that he's killed,
To get our people free.
To get our people out.
To get our people free.
To get our people out.
He'll drown em in black waters,
He'll send a swarm of flies,
Yeah, he'll slaughter those that kill us,
And he'll punish them that hide.
Where was it decided?
Where was it described,
That a man he gets no substance,
That as he lays there as he dies,
He ceases to believe,
He was ever born in blood,
That his eyes have ever seen,
That his hands have ever held,
That his lungs have ever breathed,
That he's ever been alive.
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?
Was he ever live?
