No, we have never been here
And we will never be gone
I saw your voice rise up
And cut into the heart of the sun

I kissed the lips of a girl
She took her first breath when this world was young
I felt the cold of the air
As it burned my empty lungs

And we have never been born and we will be consumed
And unreality is buried here beneath the truth
And though we've never been here, we will never be contained
And unreality is naked here beneath the moon

So we'll go down to the ocean
And wash our memory clean
We'll see the world for the first time
Through an unburied eye

And though the world will stay the same
And we're certain to die
We'll raise our hands up to Heaven
And sacrifice our limitations

And the pain and frustration
Are equal to the bliss of release
And in the eyes of nature
We will live for an eternity

And when we die, we'll disappear
Into the eyes of nature
And we are here just for a little while
And then our body disappears

Into the eyes of nature
Into the arms of God
Into the mouth of indifference
Into the eyes of nature

And we are nothing but experience
In the eyes of nature
And we will live forever
In the eyes of nature
