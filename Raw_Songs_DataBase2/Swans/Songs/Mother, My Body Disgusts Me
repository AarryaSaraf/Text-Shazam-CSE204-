Mother, don't come near me
Near me
Mother, you disgust me
I need my greed, mother,
I need my greed, mother,
Mother, my body disgusts me
I need my greed,
Mother, my scents disgust me
Mother, your body disgusts me
I hate my greed
I hate my greed, mother
I hate your smell
You disgust me
I need your dirty smell
I hate my greed
I need your dirty hands on me 
You disgust me 
I need your dirty hands on me
I need my greed
I need your dirty hands on me
Mother, you disgust me
