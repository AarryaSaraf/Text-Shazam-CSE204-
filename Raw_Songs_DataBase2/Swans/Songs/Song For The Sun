The sun is rising over the buildings across the street
The sun is God's face looking down at me as he cries for what he's done
I will survive my life if I close my mind
To all the things I could never, never, never, never, never, never be

You used to be there when I'd cry
Though you'd not see fit to comfort me
I don't need you anyway, and I'll never call you back to me
But I miss the way your body looks when you lay there naked next to me

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in

Now they say that Hell is a place where memory's dead
And the only thing left is this moment moving further away
But I will always try to remember the way you moved your lips
Against mine in the lonely bed
If I forget who you were then, I will lose what I am now
Forever and ever and ever and ever again

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
