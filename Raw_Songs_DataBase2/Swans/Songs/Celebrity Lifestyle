The secret sign of a charmed existence
Is the shiny liquid on her lips
And the ecstasy that comes with her image grows
From the power that the money gives
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
She's just floating in space
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
All her children want a suck and a taste of
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle
Yeah, her celebrity life
And she's just a drug addiction
And a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind

The secret wisdom of 120 days
Is hidden deep in between her legs 
And sexual transcendence is reserved for the wealthy 
But is only one joy that money can make, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she's got a glowing white face, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she ties her naked children up with wires and lace 
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle is the
Product of a celebrity mind, yeah
Oh, her celebrity mouth is the
Perfect image of the end of time

Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
