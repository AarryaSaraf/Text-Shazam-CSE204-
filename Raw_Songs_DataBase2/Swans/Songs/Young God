I don't know where I am
I'm dancing in my corpse
I don't remember anything

I'm wearing your flesh
Your flesh is my face
I love your face
I wrap your flesh around my face

When I wear your flesh, I love myself
When I wear your flesh, I love face
I wrap your flesh around my flesh
Then I love my flesh

I love your face
All I can do is kill
All I can do is kill
I love your flesh around me
