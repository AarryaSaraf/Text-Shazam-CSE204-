Tonight, I'll spend the night in Mona Lisa's bed 
She'll hide this beaten man beneath her innocence 
Tonight, no dream's denied in Mona Lisa's mind 
We'll ride a drowning world through the cold black sky 

Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
My mind's an ocean in Mona Lisa's hand 
She dreams a hiding world where the water runs red 

Tonight, my dreams are born on Mona Lisa's breast 
We'll walk a burning world where the sun shines darkness 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth
