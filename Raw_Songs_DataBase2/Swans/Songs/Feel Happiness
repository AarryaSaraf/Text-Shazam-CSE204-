(Shhhhhhhh)
I'm truly sorry,
For what I never did,
But I forgive you, too;
For your indifference.
You're a lonely child,
Laid open to the world,
And when I looked in your eyes
I saw myself there too,
So please forgive me now,
For what we never had,
Although its useless to say,
I wish you happiness.
I wish you happiness,
I wish you happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness,
Happiness...
