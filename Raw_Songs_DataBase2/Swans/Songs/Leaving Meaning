I can see it but not see it
I can feel it but not keep it
I can touch it but not hold it
I can be it but not know it
I can reach it but won't touch it
I contain it but release it
I unfold it but won't see it
I can breathe it but not taste it
I can know it but not show it
I will lose it but I'll keep it
In the shadow, in the light pool
In the reason for not being
I won't touch it, I won't hold it
I can be it but not feel it
I can steal it but not keep it
I can break it but not heal it

Somewhere
No place - let's go!
Nowhere
This place - let's go!
Reaching
Not being - let's go!
Reaching
Not feeling - let's go!
Glorious
No one, no us - let's go!
Glorious
No one, no us - let's go!
