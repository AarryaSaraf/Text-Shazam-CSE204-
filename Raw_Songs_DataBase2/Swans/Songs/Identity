Now I'm breathing the breath of God
And the cold wind cleans my mind
And I'm standing in a ring of fire
And my heart is made of light

And I fly across the red mountains
And my hands contain the sky
And the earth rolls away in darkness
And I ride a piece of lightning
Killing time
Killing time

Now they punish our imagination
And corrupt our blood with fear
And infinity's beneath the ocean
But oblivion sits right beside me here

So we are blind and we're polluted
And each breath is drunk with tears
We'll drift away across tomorrow
And we'll ride the breath of nothing through the years
Killing time
Killing time
