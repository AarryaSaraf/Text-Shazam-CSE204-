My frozen, empty, violent mind caressed the hidden hair that shines
With liquid lust I left behind your body stained with ruined eyes 
I cut the skin, concealed the crimes, with liquid hate I left inside 
And loneliness is buried here in rotting holes beneath your fear 
Your agony, your twisted struggle, two bodies sink in meat-blood strangled 
The smell of death, your tortured gash, enfold me in your mother's arms

Now hold me in your mother's arms
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms (now hold me in your mother's arms)
