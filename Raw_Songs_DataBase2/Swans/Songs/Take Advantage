Play with a pig, and you become a pig
Play in the mud, and you sink in the mud
fall in a hole, and you stay in a hole
you'll be there to look at, at the top of the stairs
they're talking about you
when they come down, they'll know what to do
they've worked out a scene
according to your weakness, according to how you can be used
look at the monkey suck and pull
look at monkey chew on his leash
because he wants control of his movements
