Choking while laughing
the dog splits open
his steel heart cracks
and his blood pumps out on the sidewalk
you laugh out loud
the sound hangs in the air
and discolors the walls
and poisons your mind
it sticks to your mind 
bolt the door shut
and sit down at the table
while hiding your teeth
your insides split open
you choked on a laugh
