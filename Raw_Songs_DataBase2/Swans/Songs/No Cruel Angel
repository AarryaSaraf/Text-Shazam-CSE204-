The bridge is long and narrow
the hills are burned by sorrow
the black crow died of blackness
the moon gave up his madness
but when two hearts like ours return
to the open sea
no arm can pull us down
no angel beneath the water
can never pull us under
some eyes can seal no secrets
but time erodes a surface
a snake swims the ocean
in an earth that turns for no one
but when two minds like ours dream
in an open sea
no steel door can close us in
no cruel angel at the gate
will ever seal our fate
the bridge is long and narrow
the hills drown in sorrow
the black crow died of blackness
the moon gave up his madness
but when two hearts like ours return
to the open sea
but when two minds like ours dream
in an open sea
no cruel arm can pull us down
no steel door can close us in
no angel beneath the water
will ever take us under
in an open sea
we're in an open sea
in an open sea
