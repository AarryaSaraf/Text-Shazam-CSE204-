Surrender, surrender
Go under bright water
The flooding is coming
Give up to Sun Fucker
The naked, the crawling
They become us while burning

Surrender, surrender
Sun Fucker is calling

We are righteous, we are blighted
We are liquid, ignited
We're stealing your breathing
Your weeping is cleaning
Sun Fucker: True Eater
Sun Fucker: True Blinder

Surrender, surrender
Come home to Sun Fucker
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la little man!

I am the one with feathered plume
Who holds your heart, whose light consumes
With arms stretched out, I gather sky
One thought, one mind:
Sun Fucker eats the blind

Why am I on this earth?
Why am I on this earth?
I worship Sun Fucker!
I worship Sun Fucker!

Fuck me
