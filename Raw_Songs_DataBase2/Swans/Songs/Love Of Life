For the love of life
For the love of life
In the light of life
In the love of light

And the strong survive
For the love of life
And the strong will rise
In the endless light

For the blood of life
For the love of life
In the bloodless light
For the love of life

In the blood is light
In the light is life
For the love of life
For the love of life

In the endless light
In the blood of life
Now the strong will rise
For the love of light

In the bloodless light
Now the strong survive
For the love of life
For the blood of life

And the heavens come
For the strongest ones
In a universe
Made of blood and love

In the blood is light
In the light is life
For the love of life
For the love of life
