One, two, three, four

His hands are on my throat
My key is in his hand
I'm splayed here on some curb
Shards of glass say starry night
When will this pigman stop?
His stink is like the dog
My life is mine to keep
I still kill him in my sleep
The car door is open wide
The mouth of death still calls my name
I'll beat him on his face
And I stab with all my strength
And I scream until he goes
I scream until he's gone
Then I crawl across the road
Then I crawl across the road
When will I return?
When will I return?

(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
(Aaaaaah)
Oh I'm alive
