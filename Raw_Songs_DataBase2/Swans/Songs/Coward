I'm a coward. Put your knife in me

I don't know you
I can't use you
I don't know you
I can't use you
I don't know you
I can't use you
Put your knife in me
Put your knife in me
Put your knife in me
Put your knife in me
Put your knife in me
Put your knife in me
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I love you
I'm worthless

Put your knife in me
And walk away
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
Walk away
Walk away
I love you
I love you
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I love you
I'm worthless
I love you
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
I'm worthless
Walk away
Walk away

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
Put your knife in me
I love you
Put your knife in me
I love you
Put your knife in me
