I mean nothing to myself.
I mean nothing to myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I don't move, I'm stuck in myself.
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
Glory! glory! glory!
Glory! glory! glory!
