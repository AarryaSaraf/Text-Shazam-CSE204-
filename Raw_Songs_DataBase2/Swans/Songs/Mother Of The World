In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again

And where are you now
O Mother of the world

Ah we feed from your hands
and we drink from your filth and your oil

So send them down 
to scrape and suck the soil

Keep us safe inside
your damp and rusty coil

In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again

Mother sun
Mother of senseless things

Mother come
Kill time as it begins
