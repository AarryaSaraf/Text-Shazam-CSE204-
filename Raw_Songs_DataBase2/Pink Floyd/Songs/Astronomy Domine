Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down
The sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare
Dan Dare
Who's there?

Lime and limpid green, the sound resounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound resounds
The icy waters underground
