Well, I'm a King Bee
Buzzing around your hive
Yes, I'm a King Bee, child
Buzzing around your hive
I can make good honey
Let me come inside

I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
You know I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
Well, when you hear me buzz, little girl
You know some stinging going on

Well, buzz some
Oh sting
Yeah

Well, I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long
Yes I'm a King Bee
Can buzz all night long
Well, I can buzz better baby
When your man is gone
