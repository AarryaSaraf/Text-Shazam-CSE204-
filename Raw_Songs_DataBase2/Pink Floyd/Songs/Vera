Where the hell are you?
Over 47 German planes were destroyed with the loss of only 15 of our own aircraft
Where the hell are you, Simon?

Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that we would meet again
Some sunny day?

Vera! Vera!
What has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?
