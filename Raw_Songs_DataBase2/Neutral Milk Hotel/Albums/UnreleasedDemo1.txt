// Sweet Marie //

Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

Sweet Marie with your raspberry sunshine
Won't you take me where I've never known
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Like the weeds grow in my mind
I know you, know you like the wind as it's blown

Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

Dream of me when the day sings of sunshine
Dream of me when your lucks gone away
I'll show you, show you, show you, show you, show you
How the snow falls in your mind
I know you, know you're gonna find it some day

Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

The fall is not as hard as they told you so
A love will soon define a place to grow

Lonely child of dreams
Won't you ever dream of me
Won't you love me like a ship
Setting sail upon the sea
And don't you ever feel afraid
Of falling like a hate parade
Hoping someone will love you
Someone will love you soon

Lonely child of eyes
Won't you ever follow me
Into an evening sky
Into a make believe
Where hands they hold on true
And flowers blow tiny balloons
And no ones lonely
When no one is an only one

The sun will fall
The day will fade
And I will join the hate parade
And I will love a heart untrue
That's slipping softly from my room

// Love You More Than Life //

Let the world collapse and die
It's sinking deeper in your eyes
And I will sing a sweet surprise for no one

Let the world collapse and swallow
All the love she'll hold tomorrow
And I will shield and I will follow no one

And I'm all screwed up
But I feel all right
Sinking deeper all the time
Inside a hole deep in my mind
But I love you, I love you
More than life

Let the world collapse and fold
It gave me no, nothing at all
And I will shield and I will fall for no one

Let it sink and let it shudder
All the words that I will mutter
In hopes your love will soon discover no one

And I'm all screwed up
But I feel all right
Sinking deeper all the time
Inside a hole deep in my mind
But I love you, I love you,
Oh I love you, yes I love you,
Oh I love you
More than life

More than life [x3]

// Candy Coated Dream //

A candy coated dream
With parks and trees and figurines
And her arms wrapped 'round my sleeve
With tiny steps and eyes of green;
Toy guitar that's out of tune
Eyes fixed on morning time cartoons
And by the lantern of the moon
I will dream of a love like you

And will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child,
As she is dancing now;
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now

A candy coated dream
With hearts and string and angel wings
And her life will fall between
The cracks that follow you and me

And will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child,
As she is dancing now;
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now

// Through My Tears (a.k.a. Message Sent) //

Watch the wind blow your cigarette smoke
Through my window and out to the sky
This message sent, drilled into your heart
But now the ink will fade
Before the night is through my dear

Where were you when the cracks were forming
Where were you when it all caved in
You were sleeping safe that morning
Holding insecurities that burrowed underneath your skin
And fade away

All alone - another twisted moment's gone
That will never pass this way again
And through it all I thought there'd be some shred of hope
But faith I've found will do you in
And all the words that build into
A bridge of love between me and you
Will stumble, crack and fail to fly
And now my only one, where have you gone
Are you another heart that I must sing goodbye my dear

Where were you when the cracks were forming
Where were you when it all caved in
You were sleeping safe that morning
Holding insecurities that burrowed underneath your skin
And fade away

// I Hear You Breathe //

I hear you breathe as you sleep through the morning
And the sun cracks through winter's wind
Screaming out an effervescent warning
That all that's true is sure to end

But won't you peel your pies to the TV screen
Won't you read me your articles from your boring magazines
Which fill the spaces with your lipstick screams
Well that's all you ever gave, that's all you ever gave to me.

Sinking like a stone in the water all alone
You will not find me
Your reflection is the only sight you'll see
A heart that has no memory
For all your tears they will drown you
And sink you for one million miles
And when the fear of life has finally found you
And crushes you inside the ocean tides
My ship will be sailing by

// Bucket (Organ Version) //

Shadows on my wall
They creep and crawl on through the night
They dream of waterfalls
Catching small, bright streams of light

Life can be so weird
A bucket full of tears
But it's all right
I've seen the light
And I've still got time to fly away

Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you
I'm hoping all these things
And strength it brings will see me through

And life can be so weird
A bucket full of tears
But it's all right
I've seen the light
And I've still got time to fly away
