// Engine //

For I am an engine
And I'm rolling on
Through endless revisions to state what I mean 
For sweetness alone who flew out through the window
And landed back home in a garden of green

You're riding alone in the back of a steamer
And steaming yourself in the warm shower spray
And water rolls on off the round captain's belly
Who's talking to tigers from his cafeteria tray

And sweet babies cry for the cool taste of milking
That milky delight that invited us all
And if there's a taste in this life more inviting
Then wake up your windows and watch as the sweet babies crawl
Away

// April 8th //

Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
half-awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
inside my bedroom all alone

There is no use in waiting
offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
let me hear the rain tap on your street
knowing I am safe on the inside
blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep

// Oh Sister //

Oh sister, don't be afraid of me
I won't be nailing you down in the nursery
Just like the rest of them did with those watery
Wandering fingers of spit that were supposed to be glorious and fine

Oh sister, won't you believe in me
I only wanted to be hard on the family
Here with you now in this silly infirmary
Your mother makes frantic and drunk calls from Germany all of the time

And oh sister, sweet brown and beulahery
Milk from your blisters on your grandmother's jewelry
There in the parlor all naked in front of me
Watching the lights from the cracks making archery animal designs

Rose Wallace Goldaline just moves her mouth over anything
That's fleshy, free and flowering
Like oranges out in the open
But don't you waste your sins again
She don't need you or won't fuck your friends
And you, well you're American
Self important boiling over
To prove that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist
And won't ever never give a shit
About all those words you're wasting
To gain some pretty, bright and bubbly
Wondrous dream you'd like to kill and cling and claim her as your own
But don't you worry all those dainty and dirty
Emotions just go away and fade out on their own

Sister, now that you're leaving
Our fingers will falter, our lungs will be leaking
All over each other and without even speaking
We'll know that it's over and smile and go greeting whatever comes next

And oh sister you're getting married
To some angry twister that you'll have to carry home
Drunk every evening from the cemetery
And if he makes it back half alive you can bury him under your sheets

And oh sister now that you're grieving
I cannot imagine there is any meaning
Forgetting you ever could once have the feeling
That made you keep on and continue to breathing of all of this world

And in an age of empty rings
I don't want to feel a thing
I don't even want to know
Rose Wallace Goldaline
Don't you ever die on me
Don't you on the way you go

// Ferris Wheel On Fire //

Well now first of all
We became what we always had feared
Every engine holds
All their oils on fire appeared
They finally broke through
And on your shoulder
This weight has been placed upon you
And everything we ever were

But, now I'm keeping still
In someone's bright carnival ride
And all the crowd just cheers
As the bolts break and metal collides
Spiraling through
And flying up over the hills
And now everything's broken in two
And everything we ever were

But now most of all
I am holding you under my skin
Watch these buildings fall
Watch as each weak resistance caves in
All over you all implode
And now finally fading from view
Is everything we ever were now

// Home //

Home – where you can hold your hands together all you please
Won't erase the tender tidings you endured
You're just another family member on their knees
Just a social work statistic out the door
They beat against the tender sidings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
Where they are tonight well you will never know
But I swear that I will find them now
More – it's more than just a simple question of decay
More than all those fists than beat into your door
It's more than all the shrinks that told you you're okay
It's more than anything that I have waited for
They beat against the tender sidings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
And if they even can remember I don't know
But I swear that they'll remember now
Home – it's just another word you'll always push away
Just a memory you wear outside your clothes
And it will burn down into cinders and some day
They will burrow down to their parental holes
They beat against the tender sidings of your soul
With all those pretty little hammers of control
And if they've ever paid a price well I don't know
But I swear that they will pay one now

// I Will Bury You In Time //

I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where I am smiling on your shoulder
You have buried my beliefs
Where all your sisters sleep
But their scent of purity will bleed
When their youth is over
Frozen in some lost October

And I am breathing into you
It makes your features move
And they shimmer like balloons that fly above the ocean
All the world is waiting here
You can hear the children cheer
But they'll need you when you're near
The brink of complete implosion
Crown your king when your life is broken

Everything you are I'm tearing through
Everything you want I'm wanting too
I gave you more than I thought I could ever do
But I will never break you

And if I was the king of all the kids
You'd hear me singing in my spit
But all you would hear is the shit inside my burnt emotions
I will bury you in time
When the sea begins to slide
Into this hole where you and I will sing our songs unbroken
As the water starts its chokin'
Dee dee dee dee dee [etc.]

// A Baby For Pree / Glow Into You //

Blistering Pree, all smiling and swollen
Makes babies to breathe with their hearts hanging open
All over the sheets as soft as beets in some brown dresser drawer
And with bees in her breath and the rest of her ringing
They'll sting through her chest with a force hard and beating
'Til wonderfully wet she will get
Until she's soaked inside her clothes
And there is no sorry to be sorry for
For roll around the floor some afternoon so sound and soft
It made her swallow all her sweat with every bit of breath she coughed
And when the day it came to pour 
All her babies all across the bathroom floor
She will be swimming in them all forevermore

Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you
And I let you down
Swollen and small is where you find me now
That silver stripping off my tongue you're tearing out
You'll never hear me talk
Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you

And I will be strong, strong enough
To shout above your voice that's blaring on
And your face that's falling out into the dust of what you want
I'll never hear you talk

Glow right into you, I will glow
Right into you I will glow
Right into you

And with my little fingers
I could make it all crumble
I could make it all over
Before you would even know
Glow

// My Dream Girl Don't Exist //

My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
And this day I can still hear the sound
Of a life in outer space

My dream girl don't exist 
It just you and I and this TV
And this illness seems to feel so strange
Like a henchman that's about to hang
The moon up like a ball and chain
And set its sands ablaze

And the weight is waiting off
Feel the world so real and strong 

My dream girl don't exist
Just a photograph in a history book
And I believe she had a voice and name
Three children on the coast of Maine
And her life was in a hurricane
Of love and real embrace

My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So one day she took a stroll to town
And walked in front of a Greyhound bound
For New York Central State

And the weight is waiting off
And the weight is waiting off
Feel the world so real and strong
She goes, and now she knows
She'll never be afraid
