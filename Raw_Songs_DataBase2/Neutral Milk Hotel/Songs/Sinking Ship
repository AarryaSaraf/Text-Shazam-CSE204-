Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness spills against my face
Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still? 
Oh, can't you feel the coming waves?
A perfect Sunday portrait of my mother painting horses all alone
Of lovers and of leavers still believing they are free to come and go

Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness is all that you are
A portrait of my father as a baby sleeping underneath the stars
A small pill of forgiveness I am giving to myself
It's what I need
A small gift of fulfillment I am hoping you will open and receive

Sinking ship-
How long can you hold still?
Your illness fills this empty room
A portrait of your lover softly drowning in the warm waters of June
A perfect Sunday portrait of my mother sending signals through the drum
A portrait of my sadness finding shelter in the safety of my home
