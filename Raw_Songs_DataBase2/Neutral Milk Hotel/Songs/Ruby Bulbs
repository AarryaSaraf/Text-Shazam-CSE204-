I need to taste your voice in my mouth
I need to taste your voice in the air
And I need to feel your skin against all that I retch out
And feel your voice all over everywhere

I need to paste your skin around the mailbox
And hold the postman in your smile
I need to fill your lungs with smallpox
And fill the glow of a sick and distorted life

Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful baby
All filled with angels
Beautiful babies
All filled with angels

We are wrecking in your over
We are swimming in your speakers
We are sticky stuff all over
Coming out from all your features
For free
And I say I want inside you
Because there's nothing on the surface
But it hurts to have to hold you
And all your holes they hold no purpose
For me
