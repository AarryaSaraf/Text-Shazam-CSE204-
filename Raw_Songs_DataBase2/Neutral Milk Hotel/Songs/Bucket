Shadows on my wall
They creep and crawl in burning white
They dream of waterfalls
Catching slow bright streams of light.

And life can be so weird
Bucket full of fear
But it's alright
I'm on an isle
And I've still got time to fly away

Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you
I'm hoping all these things
and the strength they bring will pull me through

and life can be so weird
Bucket full of fear
But it's alright
I'm on an isle
And I've still got time to fly away.
