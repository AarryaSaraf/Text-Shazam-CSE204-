Greet all your friends and they say hello
They tie all your ends until they tie
Yourself in again into something whole
Something secure and lost inside

And climb away

All of the forces we uphold
And all of the dangers we escape
You wonder sometimes how long we'll hold
Till all of this anger shows its way

And breaks

Away
I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay

There are just some things we can't know
There are just some things you can't face
But I will secure myself and blow
Against this disease that you embrace

And waste away

And beginning again takes so much time
And all of your friends come to watch you go
And as your machine pulls from the drive
You watch as their empty hearts explode

And blow

Away
Away
I'm okay
I'm okay
