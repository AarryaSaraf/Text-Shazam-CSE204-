Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the sea-weed water
Semen stains the mountaintops
Semen stains the mountaintops

With coca leaves along the border
Sweetness swings from every corner
Cars careening from the clouds
The bridges burst and twist around

And wanting something warm and moving
Bend towards herself, the soothing
Proves that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist

Sweet communist, the communist daughter
Standing on the sea-weed water
Semen stains the mountaintops
Semen stains the mountaintops
