I love you Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do
I love you Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ, I love you, yes I do

And on the lazy days 
The dogs dissolve and drain away
The world it goes and always waits
The day we are awaiting



Up and over, we go through the wave and undertow
I will float until I learn how to swim
Inside my mother in a garbage bin
Until I find myself again, again

Up and over we go with mouths open wide and spitting still
I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the doorway as the sideboards creak
With them ever proclaiming me, me

Up and over we go, the weight it sits on down and I don't know
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine, machine
