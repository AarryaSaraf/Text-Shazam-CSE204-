One, two, three..

Cindy smiles
And overcoats
She says, "Please stay a while!"
Like ice cream floats and dreams
And I will fill you heart
With boats and bills and beams and candy-appled everythings
Bills and beams and candy-appled everythings

Cindy skips my trampoline
With toys and horns and bouncing things
And even the most silent must sing a song of love
Yes even the silent, they must sing a song of love

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

A happy girl, she's spinning
These strings in her curls
And it's only the beginning
Of a trip around the world
Cindy, won't you smile?
Cindy, won't you sleep a while?
I feel like just a child
Sinking down one hundred million miles

Ooooh...
Ooooh...

Rain...
Rain is a perfectly sculpted garden of wetness
