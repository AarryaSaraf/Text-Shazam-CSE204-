Watch the wind blow your cigarette smoke
Through my window and out to the sky
This message sent, drilled into your heart
But now the ink will fade
Before the night is through my dear

Where were you when the cracks were forming
Where were you when it all caved in
You were sleeping safe that morning
Holding insecurities that burrowed underneath your skin
And fade away

All alone - another twisted moment's gone
That will never pass this way again
And through it all I thought there'd be some shred of hope
But faith I've found will do you in
And all the words that build into
A bridge of love between me and you
Will stumble, crack and fail to fly
And now my only one, where have you gone
Are you another heart that I must sing goodbye my dear

Where were you when the cracks were forming
Where were you when it all caved in
You were sleeping safe that morning
Holding insecurities that burrowed underneath your skin
And fade away
