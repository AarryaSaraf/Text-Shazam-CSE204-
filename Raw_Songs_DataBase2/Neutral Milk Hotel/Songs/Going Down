I crushed the world I was in
I'll destroy the world I will find
I'll work the tools with my hands
I'll stick the needles in my eyes

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down

Bring down the sky with my tears
Dig up the earth with my hands
Take a look inside of my head
Maybe then you could understand

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down

So long, again my friend
I guess its time I let you know
These things, they come around
I guess they just get hard to let them go
You wait around while
You'll never seem to find that faith in me
You close your eyes and smile
Forever I will be

I know the way and I will go
I know the way and I will find
It's all around me, and I told you so
It around and hear goodbye (All around in here, goodbye)

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
And through the complications
Something inside me died
And now I'm going down
And all the big decisions
We never could decide
And now I'm going down

And in my celebration
You were by my side
And now I'm going down
