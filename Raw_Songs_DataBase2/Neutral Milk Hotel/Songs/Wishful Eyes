Wishful eyes
Fill this room up with the spirit of your pride
So, that all the world can hear it go in vain
Tripping to the drain, wait I can explain
Inside myself that I am seeking

Little smiles,
Every moment brings another wasted mile
Between everything and everything I need
Get up to leave for the time has come for leaving
And if it don't succeed will just bury all the leaves
And we could escape this emptiness

Someone take control of me
I am spinning in infinity
With my life its going endlessly from control
Take off your clothes for the time has come for sleeping
Cause everybody know the world continues though
Whether or not your still breathing

Little child
I discovered you and hold you till good-bye
Just to punch you in the face with nothing more
Then when all my anger bore
Its little head it started screaming
That we've heard this all before
So just open up the door
And fill your mouth with freedom's feeling

But, someone take control of me
I am trudging with my infantry
With my army and my enemies taking all
Take off your clothes for the time has come for sleeping
Cause everybody know the world continues though
Whether or not your still breathing
