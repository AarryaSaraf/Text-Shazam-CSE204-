When there's no one else around
And the world just brings you down
And the sun starts turning black
And Nelson's head is in a sack

Won't you smile for me?
Won't you smile for me?

When balloon just blows up
And your teeth are in a cup
And the drugs you bought don't high
And you only want to die

Won't you smile for me?
Won't you smile for me?

If the times just make you spit
And your world is full of shit
Turn your gray eyes to blue
And let me have one last look at you

And smile for me
Won't you smile for me?

Come on, smile
Come on, smile
Come on, smile
Yeah, come on, smile
