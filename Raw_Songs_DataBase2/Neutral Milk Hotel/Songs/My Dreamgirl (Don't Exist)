My dream
My dream girl don't exist 
At the age of 5 she slit her wrists
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around 
So her parents buried her in the ground 
My dream girl don't exist
She's working at a McDonald's in Madison Wisconsin
She could have been cool but she let the system get to her
She forgot all about art and just made hamburgers
My dream girl don't exist
They're sitting around watching TV
They're out stuffing- shit
