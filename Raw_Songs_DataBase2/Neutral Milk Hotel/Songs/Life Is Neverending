If I were a mirror
I'd look right deep myself
And if things were much clearer
I'd see a brighter day

And if you were my lover
I'd wrap your locks around my wrist
And shake beneath the shudders
That turn to black or fade

For you know that life is never ending
But some times the miles do seem too long to try
But I've got a love
She is my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood, and hate and anger
And let it go

If I were the summer
I'd give my light to all the world
And wake you in your slumber
So you could see my eyes

And as your feelings crumble
And all the words I keep unfurl
I'll catch you in your tumble
And kiss your face goodbye

For you know that life is never ending
But some times the miles do seem too long to try
But I've got a love
She is my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood, and hate and anger
And let it go

If I were made of water
I'd slip my thumbs into the cracks
And freeze when it got colder
To hold the walls in, true

And when it came to summer
I'd slip my soul into the yard
And give life to the flowers
That I never gave to you

But I know that life is never ending
But some times the miles can cut you down to size
But I had a love
She was my anger, She held me down
And saved my soul
So take the blood you never gave her
And let it go
