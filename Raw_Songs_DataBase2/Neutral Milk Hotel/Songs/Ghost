Ghost, ghost, I know you were within me, feel you as you fly
In thunder clouds above the city, into one that I loved
With all that was left within me 'till we tore in two
Now wings and rings and there's so many waiting here for you

And she was born in a bottle rocket, 1929
With wings that ringed around a socket right between her spine
All drenched in milk in holy water pouring from the sky
I know that she will live forever, she won't ever die

She goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape

And one day in New York City, baby, a girl fell from the sky
From the top of a burning apartment building fourteen stories high
And when her spirit left her body, how it split the sun
I know that she will live forever, all goes on and on

And she goes
And now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape
