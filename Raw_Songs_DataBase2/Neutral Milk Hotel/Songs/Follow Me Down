Follow me down
Strings of water plain
Eyes are underground
Wash the seed away
Hands are feathered drums that spin
Sound inside the quay

Follow me down
Follow me today

Found you wishing rainbows
Tasting words of wine
Felt just like a painting
Colour stripping eye
The sun creeps through your window
And slowly fades away

Follow me down
Follow me today
