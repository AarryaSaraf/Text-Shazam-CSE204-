You can deny all your addictions
da da da da da
(burp)
do do de de do
(burp)
la la la la la la la
That's how the melody goes
It's on tape so I won't forget it
'Cause I'm a pretty weird guy
And I probably won't remember it
'Cause it's currently 2:30 in the morning
And I'm smoking cigarettes
And I just came up with this melody and wrote some lyrics
And I think it's gonna turn into a song
So I guess I'll just put it on a tape
But then again these tapes cost me two dollars
And I'm wasting more space than I should
So I'll shut up
So OK
