Well, I never will forget that floating bridge
Lord, I never will forget that floating bridge
Lord, I never will forget that floating bridge
They tell me five minutes time underwater I was hid

I was going down and I throwed up my hands
As I was going down, I throwed up my hands
As I was going down, I throwed up my hands
Saying, "Please Lord, take me on dry land!"

Well, they carried me in the house and they laid me 'cross the bed
Well, they carried me in the house, they laid me 'cross the bed
Well, they carried me in a house, they laid me 'cross the bed
I couldn't hear nothing but muddy waters running round my head

Oh my mother often told me, "Quit playing a bum."
My mother always told me, "Quit playing a bum."
Lord, my mother always told me, "Son, quit playing a bum!
Go out somewhere and make a crumb!"

All the people on the bridge were screaming and crying
Well, all the people on the bridge were screaming and crying
All the people on the bridge stood screaming and crying
Saying, "Lord have mercy, we're doing fine"
