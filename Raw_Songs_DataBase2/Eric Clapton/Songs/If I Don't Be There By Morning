Blue sky upon the horizon
Private eye is on my trail
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have spent the night in jail

I've been running from Memphis to LA
Had an appointment set sometime for today
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have gone the other way

Finding my way back to you girl
Lonely and blue and mistreated too
Sometimes I think of you girl
Is it true that you think of me too?

I got a woman living in LA
I got a woman waiting for my pay
And if I don't be there by morning
Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray

Blue sky upon the horizon
Private eye is on my trail
And if I don't be there by morning
You know that I must have spent the night in jail

I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill
I left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still
If I don't be there by morning
You know that I, I never will
