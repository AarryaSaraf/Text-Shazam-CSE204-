Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Lord, I'm going away just to wear you off my mind
Well, you keep me worrying about it all the time

Well, I've needed the love of four women in my life
Well, I've needed the love of four women in my life
Well, my mother and my sister, sweetheart and my wife

If you don't want me baby, please don't dog me around
If you don't want me baby, please don't dog me around
Well, just like you found me, you can put me down

Well now, goodbye, baby, if you crawl back home
Well now, goodbye, baby, if you crawl back home
You can go away, swear you won't stay long
