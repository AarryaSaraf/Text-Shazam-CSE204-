Album: NoReasonToCry

// Beautiful Thing //

I've told you once, now you should know
The reason that I'm coming down
There ain't no time to repeat again
Just need to bring it around

We had a beautiful thing going
You couldn't see things my way
We had a beautiful thing going
Something just got in our way

And I told you once that it was rough
I looked on you as my friend
Because that did not seem to be good enough
And now it's time to begin

We've got a beautiful thing going
I hope that's the way it will stay
We've got a beautiful thing going
Nothing can stand in our way

We've got a beautiful thing going
I hope that's the way it will stay
We've got a beautiful thing going
Nothing can stand in our way

// Carnival //

Come with me, come with me
To the carnival, to the carnival

You will see, you will see
You will see, you will see
What you want to see, exactly what you want to be
At the carnival, at the carnival, at the carnival

Come with me, come with me
To the carnival, to the carnival

Come with me, come with me
Come with me, come with me

// County Jail Blues //

They picked me up
Put me in the county jail
They picked me up
Put me in the county jail
They wouldn't let my woman
Come and post my bail

Now I'm in prison
I've almost done my time
Now I'm in prison
I've almost done my time
They gave me six months
I had to work out nine

I know my baby
She's gonna jump and shout
I know my baby
She's gonna jump and shout
When the train comes in
And I come walking out

Take these stripes from around me
Chains from around my legs
Take these stripes from around me
Chains from around my legs
The stripes don't hurt me
The chains could kill me dead

// All Our Past Times //

I don't want to be the one to say I'm sorry
I don't want to be the one to take the blame
I don't want to be the one to throw it over
I don't want to be the one to feel ashamed

I don't want to be the one who thinks of nothing
I don't want to be the one to tell you what you have seen
After all this time, well I thought that you were mine
I just want to be the one who would share this dream

All our past times should be forgotten
All our past times should be erased
I don't care how much it costs
'Cause I don't count the loss
As long as I can see your face again

You don't have to tell me when you're leaving
If it's half past one, if it's maybe four
It makes no difference where you think you're going
But please remember not to slam the door

All our past times should be forgotten
All our past times should be erased
I don't care how much it costs
'Cause I don't count the loss
As long as I can see your face again

Yes, I don't care how much it costs
You know I don't count the loss
As long as I can see your face again

// Innocent Times //

I was a child born so free
It seems that time has put age on me
And when I grow old, will I once again find
All of those sweet, innocent times?

I was a child born without fear
It seems that time has placed me here
With no freedom to laugh, there's more reason to cry
I really miss those innocent times

I used to feel joy in my soul
But now my sorrow has taken control
As I look around I pray, Lord be kind
Just one more taste of those innocent times

As I look around I pray, Lord be kind
Just one more taste of those innocent times
Just one more taste of those innocent times

// Hungry //

Last night as I stepped into the stage lights
I heard the people cry when they saw my face
There's nothing like our hearts beating in time
The crowd may inspire, but you give me my strength

Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry
For your sweet smile
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I need to hold you for a while

I've been slipping into desperation
You're the only salvation that the Lord designed
Your absence is controlling my defenses
My life is senseless without you by my side

Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry
For your sweet smile
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I need to hold you for a while

Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry
For your sweet smile
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I need to hold you for a while

Loose ladies on the road will drive you crazy
Every "no" becomes a "maybe", it never takes too long
Missing you, I don't know what I'm gonna do
You don't know what I'm going through; everything seems wrong

Oh, hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry
For your sweet smile
Lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely
I need to hold you for a while

// Black Summer Rain //

Where is the sun
The sun that used to shine on me?
Where has it gone
Or is it just a memory?

I looked through the window
Staring at the sky
Waiting for a moment
That always passed me by

Black summer rain
Black summer rain
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl

Where is the love
The love I need to set me free?
And how can I escape
This gloom that is swallowing me?

Black summer rain
Black summer rain
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl

Black summer rain
Black summer rain
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl

// Last Night //

Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had
She's gone away and left me; that makes me feel so bad

It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you
It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you
I'll love you, love you, baby, till I don't know what to do

Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had
Now you've gone away and left me; that makes me feel so bad
