// Walk Out In The Rain //

Walk out if it doesn't feel right
I can tell you're only lying
If you've got something better tonight
Then don't mess up my mind with your crying

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you don't feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain

I have come from so far away
Just to put a ring on your finger
If you've said all that you've got to say
Then please don't feel the need to linger

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you don't feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain

It's raining outside of the city
My poor feet have walked till they're sore
If you don't want my love, it's a pity
I guess I can't see you no more

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you don't feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain

Just walk out in the rain
Walk out with your dreams
Walk out of my life if you don't feel right
And catch the next train
Oh, darling, walk out in the rain

// Watch Out For Lucy //

Now my friend Bill was just a working lad
And he liked to have his fun
He liked to find a girl and get comfortable
When his working day was done

He would spend all his money on a Friday night
Wake up in the morning broke
Oh he had a run in with little Lucy then
Believe me that ain't no joke

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

She started out working in a cafe
Picking money up on the side
She was free and easy, everybody's friend
But she couldn't be satisfied

So in walks Bill with his cash in his hand
His heart upon his sleeve
We tried to warn him about her ways
We never did succeed

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

Well, the trap was sprung for poor old Bill
You should have heard little Lucy sing
"I want a Cadillac car, a beautiful home
And a thousand dollar ring"

They found our hero in the gutter
With a diamond ring and a gun
He done it for the love of Lucy
And ended up on the run

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

Watch out for Lucy though she may look frail
Say excuse me, Lucy, darling, don't you use me
I don't want to land in jail

// I'll Make Love To You Anytime //

Well I can't read and I can't write
And I don't know my left from right

I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time at all

I can't swim and I can't fly
I ain't no fish, ain't a bird in the sky

I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time at all

I can't count from one to ten
And I don't know the shape I'm in

I can't tell if the sun's gonna shine
And I don't know if you'll ever be mine
But I'll make love to you any old time at all

// Roll It //

Roll it, rock it, roll it in the socket
Roll, roll it, roll, roll it
Feel it, can you feel it, all night, all right
Oh burn it, rock it, moving in the socket
Yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Gonna getcha, gonna getcha, here it comes, don't try to run
I must love you, gonna sock it, gonna roll it, gonna rock
Roll, roll it, roll, roll it
Oh lord, rock it, loving in the socket, yeah yeah

// Tell Me That You Love Me //

Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I'm your one and only man
Give me confirmation with every passing day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away

Catch me when I'm falling, help me when I'm blue
Don't you realize that I'd do the same for you?
Find me when I'm lonely, carry me back home
Treat me gently and my heart will never roam

Straighten me out, pull me through
Let me know that I'm still in love with you
Be my woman, be my friend
Stick with me until the very end

Straighten me out, pull me through
Let me know that I'm still in love with you
Be my woman, be my friend
Stick with me until the very end

Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I'm your one and only man
Give me confirmation with every passing day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away

Tell me that you love me as often as you can
Let me know that I'm your one and only man
Give me confirmation with every passing day
A love as sweet as ours will never fade away

Catch me when I'm falling, help me when I'm blue
Don't you realize that I'd do the same for you?
Find me when I'm lonely, carry me back home
Treat me gently and my heart will never roam

// Early In The Morning //

When a girl reach the age of 18
She begins to think she's grown
And that's the kind of little girl
You can never find at home

Come and see me early in the morning
Just about the break of day
Want to see me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay?

One drink of wine
Two drinks of gin
Pretty young got me
In the shape I'm in

Come and see me early in the morning
Just about the break of day
Want to see me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay?


I pass by the juke joint
Look through the door
She's doing the boogie-woogie
In the middle of the floor

Come and see me early in the morning
Just about the break of day
Want to see me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay?

When a girl reach the age of 18
She begins to think she's grown
And that's the kind of little girl
You can never find at home

Come and see me early in the morning
Just about the break of day
Want to see me hug my pillow
Where my baby used to lay?

// Golden Ring //

He gave to you a golden ring
It made you happy, it made you sing
And I played for you on my guitar
It didn't last long, we didn't go far

And though the times have changed
We're rearranged
Will the ties that bind remain the same?

You came around after a while
Everyone said that I made you smile
It all went well, and suddenly then
You heard that he would marry again

He gave to you a golden ring
It made you happy, it made you sing
And I played for you on my guitar
It didn't last long, we didn't go far

Well I know that I have been here before
I've trod on your wings, I've opened the door
If I gave to you a golden ring
Would I make you happy, would I make you sing?

He gave to you a golden ring
It made you happy, it made you sing
And I played for you on my guitar
It didn't last long, we didn't go far

He gave to you a golden ring
It made you happy, it made you sing
And I played for you on my guitar
It didn't last long, we didn't go far

// Tulsa Time //

Well, I left Oklahoma
Driving in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was going to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine

My mother says I'm crazy
My baby calls me lazy
But I'm gonna show them all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and
I don't need no more damn schoolin'
I was born to just walk the line

Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it
Living on Tulsa Time

So there I was in Hollywood
Thinking I was doing good
Talking on the telephone line
They don't want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
My mama says my baby's doing fine

So then I started winking
Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time
That I had no business leaving
And nobody would be grieving
You see I'm on Tulsa time

Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it
Living on Tulsa Time

Living on Tulsa Time
Living on Tulsa Time
Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it
Living on Tulsa Time
