Album: WordUp

// Word Up! //

Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
'Cause we're about to throw down and you'll know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up (Up, up), everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up (Up, up), it's the code word
No matter where you say it you'll know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools

Give us music, we can use it, we need to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up (Up, up), everybody say
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway, ow

Ow, dial L for love

Ah, hey, hey
Ah, hey, hey
Now just come on, all you people say

(W-O-R-D up, W-O-R-D up) Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(W-O-R-D up, W-O-R-D up) Oooh!
(W-O-R-D up) Hey, hey
(W-O-R-D up) He-hey

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, oooh, oooh, oooh, woh
Tell me like that, like that

Say it like that, now, now, yeah
That's the word, everybody's got to know the word
Like that, come on

Ow, take me real low

// Candy //

Yeah, yeah, mmm

It's like candy
I can feel it when you walk
Even when you talk it takes over me

You're so dandy
I wanna know
Can you feel it too, just like I do?

Oooh!

This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you

There's no mistaking, I'm clearly taken
By the simple mere thought of you

Oh!

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
Oooh!

My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you

Yes, I do

Simply put you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy (Real shy)
I attempt to look my best for you
Indeed I do, just for you

'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do

It's like candy
You sure are sweet (Sweet) (Sweet)
You're so dandy (Dandy)
You're taking my appetite but it's alright

It's like candy
Oooh, vanilla
Oh, chocolate!

You look real nice, wrapped up tight
You're so dandy
You're giving me a heart attack
It's the kind I like

It's like candy
You're so dandy

Why you do

You're like a brand new feeling
In a special way
A surprise package
On a bright clear sunny day (You're so dandy)

And wrapped up tight (So good)
(So good, yeaheaheah)

Strawberry (Strawberry), raspberry (Raspberry)
All those good things
Violets and gumdrops
That's what you're saying to me, me (Me)

Ow!

Sweet candy
Candy
It's like candy
Sure seems like good candy to me

Oh, baby
Oh

You're so dandy (Watch this)
Ohoho

// Back And Forth //

There's a special kind of person
sometimes she's not all she seems
you only see what she wants you to see
and before you really know it always seems to go

Back & forth [8x]
(Our love goes)

Take your chances if you will (those looks can kill)
It'll make you go round & around
You got to know it by now
that the truth is you just can't win 
loves funny like that
It'll make you blow your cap
sacrifice everything and money
love has no guarantee's
It'll always really be

Back & forth [16x]

Take stabs dip and dab
forever tryin to find your way
it's a sellers lament 
for all the love you spent
you must have thought it was a bottomless pit
you can't do it like that
love will show you where it's at
what you put up you'll surely get back
cause there's no other way
if you play you'll pay

Back & forth [8x]

Love has no guarantee's
It'll always really be

Back & forth [16x]

// Don't Be Lonely //

Monday morning
And I find myself missing you
I'm thinking of you and your new lover
Playing it cool
Even though you tore my heart apart

I start my day just like any other day
And when the phone rings on the other end
You say, now I realize that I made the wrong move
To take you back in my life, girl
I can't see it coming through

Remembering times
We both knew we would regret
How we feel is not the issue, girl
What would you do if you were in my shoes

You can just stop trying to find a way
Back into my heart
I was never one to take two steps back
And I'll never start
After all the changes you took me through
Don't entertain the thought

I got real strong advice
And I'd like to give it to you

Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who feels the way you do
Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who's heart been broken too

I got real strong advice
And I'd like to give it to you
You're not the only one
Who's heart been broken too

Hi, long time no see
Looks like you've lost a best friend
I can understand it
I've been under the weather a bit myself

Hey, let's stop kidding ourselves
You know I've been a little crazy lately
Since we stopped seein' each other
I guess you would've never known
That unless we got a chance to talk

Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who feels the way you do
Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who's heart been broken too

Yes, ah

// She's Mine //

Look
Excuse me, sir, but I do believe
The lady arrived with me
Well

It's her style smile charm and poise
It's the past she attracts noise from the boys
They try to get in touch to rap those lines
But she's too smart to let them beat my time

She's mine
And I love it when she touches
Makes cold chills run down my spine
Mine
I don't know how she does it
But she gets her man everytime

Now she's not responsible
When you pass her
And she won't be around
When your money runs out
Cuz a love like hers han a mean punch
She eats guys like you everyday for lunch

Now the girl is sweet
She's not mean
But it's obvious though
That I'm handlin' fish
And if you wanna know
What this is all about
I'm tellin' you fellas there is no doubt

She's mine
I'm tryin' to make you realize she's
Mine
Don't come onto her with those goo goo eyes
Mine
As bittersweet as bittersweet can be
Mine
There's only one qualified and that's me

Now let me explain she's just like me
A professional person with a master's degree
From the school of hard knot fraternity
Alpha phi beta sigma

C.A.M.E.O.
The graduatin' class of Cameo
Talk to all my friends if I may say so
Let's all get up and go go you know

Can't you see see see my ID?

She's mine
Boys boys

Well I came up with one reason to rap the guys
And to spread the word to my fellow alumni
Let it be known that we're a positive group
With a taste for adventure an eye to you
So I hope I made it plain for you to see
My distinguished colieagues and their manters' degree
In the sovereign field of sociology
On the background of America we seem to see

Mine
To make you realize she's
Mine
Mine
Can't take the girl cuz she's
Mine
There's only one qualified and that's me
Hey hey

She's mine
Mine
Don't come onto her with those goo goo eyes
Mine

// Fast, Fierce & Funny //

Mo-ney, mo-ney, mo-ney, mo-ney

I'm here to make some waves, hoping to convince you, before you have a thing to say
be it a car or expensive caviar...they go to your creditors cause they know who you are
don't leave your home without American Express.
Never trust your friends without a very thorough credit check, some people will pay you with one eye on the clock;
others will have to pay through that friendly neighborhood loan shark...

fast, fierce and fu-n-n-y
the way people - can - play with your money

now I tried to romance you and I tried real hard, everything was going good until they took my credit card;
now I'm not a flakey kind of guy you see, I've got plenty of money..but unfortunately not with me.
Now your my kind of girl and you like nice things. I can tell by the clothes you wear and the size of the diamond on your ring.
As long as there's cash around there's always hope, but once you see what your cash is worth you'll deep six over and croak.

fast, fierce and fu-n-n-y
the way people - can - play with your money

baby check it out, there's no doubt
use your head, save your bread...
baby check it out.

baby check it out

The Dow Down Jones average today hit an all time low and sent the stock market crashing...
thousands panic in the effort to hold on to thier assetts, Washington has made an official statement...
and we are about to take it live to Washington'

make that money try to stay ahead make that money till ya drop dead, make that money now your on your own (now that bank won't give you a loan)
work your fingers to the bone makin' that money gotta bring it home, got no cash gotta write a check if they have it cause myÂ [?] 

money!!! money!!! work yo fingers to da bone...gonna bring that money, money hoh yeah....

// You Can Have The World //

Some people say that this is the truth
There are no genes everlastin' yet
If they live like us it wouldn't be hard to tell
Just what is heaven and where is hell

So keep on the good good
Be happy
Your genes are yours to keep
Don't be a victim now of these mean sticks

If there's a world of trouble to bust your punches
To be new
Keep the faith baby it can happen for you

You can have the world
If you want it
Don't make circumstances stop you
Opportunity will rock you
Have the world
If you want it
(Chances are you'll find)
You're gonna make it

Gonna make it through
You're gonna make it through yeah
Yeah

The best that you can do
Everything will come to you
Stop procrastinatin'
Your neck of all

If you wonder why I understand
Take the time to comb your hair
Wash your face and hands
Look the best you can
It takes a minute to find
Success and a peace of mind
If you harp it you can do it
If you put your heart into it
Just get a picture in your mind
Get very detailed what to find
And chances are you're gonna find

You can have the world
If you want it
Don't make circumstances stop you
Opportunity will rock you
Have the world
If you want it
(Chances are you'll find)
You're gonna make it

Have the world
You're gonna make it
