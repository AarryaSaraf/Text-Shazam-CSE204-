// Your Love Takes Me Out //

Love (your love)
Takes me (takes me)
Out

I'm here to try to tell my story
I know I'm shakin' but I got to state my case
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no shrink – No!
I don't need no woman that can drive me off to drink

But your love takes me straight the hell on out of here
I don't know what's in your love but it hypnotizes me - yeah
You can keep that voodoo to yourself – to yourself
Cause one hit was enough for me I had too much myself - ho

Your love takes me out

I don't know just where I've been but it takes me off the count
Your love takes me out – It takes me out

It's get the best of me and it makes me want to shout. Want to shout
Yeah, yeah

Your love excites me now, it takes me out
Your love excites me now, it takes me out

Yes I need my baby, no I don't mean maybe
Yes I need my baby, now
Say you'll be my baby
Cause those other guys are lazy
I know they'll drive you crazy and how

Yes I need my baby, no I don't mean maybe
Yes I need my baby, now
Say you'll be my baby
I know it might seem crazy
But I think that's what you make me now

Love (your love)
Takes me (takes me)
Out
(Oooh)

Hey
Ah ah hey
Yeah yeah

My friends are trying to see just what is wrong with me
Since I never acted quite this way before
When you move your hips
I start to lick my lips
And before I knew I've embarrassed myself more – ho

Maybe if I hurry I can shake your love cold turkey
Cause I never thought I need nobody else – yeah yeah
I'll go head and be just what you want me to be
As long as you promise to keep it hot – whew

Your love takes me out

I don't know just where I've been but it takes me off the count baby
Your love takes me out – It takes me out

It gets the best of me and it makes me want to shout. Want to shout

Your love excites me now, it takes me out
Your love excites me now, it takes me out

Yes I need my baby, no I don't mean maybe
Yes I need my baby, now
Say you'll be my baby
Cause those other guys are lazy
I know they'll drive you crazy and how

Yes I need my baby, no I don't mean maybe
Yes I need my baby, now
Say you'll be my baby
I know it might seem crazy
But I think that's what you make me now

Love (your love)
Takes me (takes me)
Out
Your love (love)
Takes me (takes me)
Your love

Hey, your love takes me out
Your love takes me out

Your love takes me out

It's get the best of me and it makes me want to shout. Want to shout

Your love excites me now, it takes me out
Your love excites me now, it takes me out

Yes I need my baby, no I don't mean maybe
Yes I need my baby, now
Say you'll be my baby
Cause those other guys are lazy
I know they'll drive you crazy and how

// Roller Skates //

Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates
Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates

Roller Skates
If you like this shooow!
Throw your arms around
Move hands in the air
Don't be shy now
We know that you can do it

Just one word at a time
Now form a single line
Turn yourself around
Don't be shy now
We like the way you do it

Raaah!
Roll!
Skates!
Raaah!

Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates
Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates

Sometimes! I think about
My roller skating gigs
It stays so clear in my mind
About what my mama said
Ah she said skate, skate
Skate, skate
Do you hop the line?
Don't come back
With a passed up board 
Or you gonna have a spank

Now don't you know
That my fist hop
Is a  shattering of the hip
And when I went to talk back
She smacked me on my lip
So from that day on 
I do I know, about
What my mama said
So instead of taking those skates outside
I play, basket-ball instead

But I…(Rooll!)
Roll! Yeah He!
Yes I roll, Y I Rooooll!
Sister (Skate!)
Skate all night 
Till I hope tha line! (Rock!)
Oh Yeah, Yes I rock

Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates
(Just Roller Skates!)
Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates
(In the whole wide world)
Roller skates, roller skates, roller skates, roller skates
...

[ad libs]

If you like this shooow!
Throw your arms around
Move hands in the air
Don't be shy now
We know that you can do it

Just one word at a time
Now form a single line
Turn yourself around
Don't be shy now
We like the way you do it

Raaah!
Roll!

// Better Days //

I like the way you make me feel 
Honestly I do, I do
You make me cry every time you say goodbye, and the chances are 
I'll never get to see you again, no 
No one said life was easy, oh no 
There's nothing I can do, but blow a kiss, and hope for better days. 

Better days, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah, better days 
I like those better days 
You like those better days, oh yeah 

You know I'm going to try to persuade you, yeah 
Cause without your lovin I can't make it, no I can't 
Your personality blows my mind 

Tell me why, you had to say goodbye 
Do you know if I'll see you again, my friend 
Better days, come show me the way 
But for now, we'll blow a kiss and hope for better days 

Better days, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah, better days 
I like those better days 
You like those better days, oh yeah
