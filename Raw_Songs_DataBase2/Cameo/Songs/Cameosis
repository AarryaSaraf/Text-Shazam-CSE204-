CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

When you hear a group that moves you
And you feel it in your feet
You ask yourself, hold on a minute
What group now can this be,

Get your body all excited
Cause if you listen you will know us, 
It's got to be that crazy sound of that good ole Cameosis

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
Hay hay
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If when you feel it, then you'll know it
It won't be long, you will all be strong with

Dig the sound, dig the sound
Dig it with me...

You can't believe it, if you try, you will do it

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If you try us then you like us, if you like us, then you'll see, Ha
We'll make the funky music better for you and for me
Always right for what is happenin and for dancing with a choice
But if you even can't get that much then tell me what's the point

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If when you feel it, then you'll know it
It won't be long, you will, all be strong with

Dig the sound, dig the sound
Dig it with me...

You can't believe it, if you try, you will do it

Baby bubba baby

Baby bubba, bubba
