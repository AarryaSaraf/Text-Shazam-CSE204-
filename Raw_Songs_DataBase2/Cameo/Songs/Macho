Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho
Macho be macho, macho be macho

You say you think you wanna be macho
You say your life will never run down
Ya gotta have that feeling about you
To be funky and really get down
Hey man keep a stiff upper lip
Who said that life was easy why don't you get hip
You never know what's in store for you
Can't beat 'em then join 'em then here's what you do

Stretch out!
Stretch out!

A lesson in macho it goes just like this
Jump up and down and ball up your fists
And say I I I like to dance
Just watch me move
And say oo la oo la oo la oo la
Say it again oo la oo la oo la oo la
Just let me rock
