Anything you wanna do you can do it
If you just put your mind to it
The light that guides will take its time
So just keep on sticking to it

You shouldn't give a care about tomorrow
All that's there is there - yeah
Sometimes the past was full of sorrow
But the past for sure won't get us anywhere

You can be sure that you're receiving
The best life has to offer everyday, hey
What will be will be what you want it to be
It's you who controls your destiny, hey
