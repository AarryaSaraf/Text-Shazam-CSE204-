The dark of midnight, girl, is this
A sigh, a cry, a hit, a miss
I wonder can you get to this
Our problems can't be solved with a kiss

40 days 40 nights
Well, I tried to make things be just right
I thought I'd stand in nature's way, all right
But it didn't work out so I'm here to say

It's over, it's over
It didn't last very long
It's over, it's over
It seem to all turn out wrong

I knew somehow the day would come (yes, sir)
Those clouds of grey would take away our sun (take away our sun)
We look for love each and every day (look for love)
Despite it all I'm still here alone today

Well

It's over, it's over
It didn't last very long
It's over, it's over
It seem to all turn out wrong

It's over, it's over
It's over, over, over
Over, over
Over, over
