You say you don't waste your time
And you like to get down to the bottom line
And since you don't waste your time
Please stop wastin' mine

'Cause I know just what I want
And I'm afraid to sit and talk
About the things we used to say
To each other day to day

You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
(You need to know)
I think it's time for you to go but before you do
I think there's something you should know

If you don't use it
(Don't use it)
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(You can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
(My love to you)
And I want to
(Yee-hee)
And I'll take my chances
'Cause that's the way that life is

You know how funny life can be
I take a little from you, you take a little from me
I gave you love that you can't deny
Even up to here, I always try

Because I loved you, I loved you
Gave you all I had
Now you can stick it
Girl, that's too bad

A love like ours don't grow on trees
But you didn't listen and now you see

You're always late when it comes to love
You know everything but the things you need to know
I think it's time for you to go
(For you to go)
But before you do, I think there's something you should know

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
(You'll lose it)
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
(I'm givin' my love)
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(Take my chances)

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
(Can't take it)
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
(And I'll take my chances)

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances

If you don't use it
You'll lose it
If you can't take it
Don't waste your time to fake it

I'm givin' my love to you
And I want to
And I'll take my chances
