Ain't nothing wrong with disco
It goes along with the funk
If you don't like it don't get mad at us
You say you just can't stand my music
Can't you see, yeah
The music's got a certain energy

That disco music makes me feel alive
That funky music makes me do my jive
It takes me so high I just can't see, yeah
That music always gets the best of me, huh

Get up (move, move)
Get up (move, move)
Come on, get down (move, move)
Just do it (move, move)

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy

It makes me do just what I want to do with you
It relaxes me the way I like to relax too
For any problem it's a remedy, yeah
Just thank the Lord for all that energy, huh

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy

Get up and get down (move, move)
Come on
Move it, move it
Get up (move, move)
Move it, rock it (move, move)
Come on, come on (move, move)

Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
I feel that energy
Energy
