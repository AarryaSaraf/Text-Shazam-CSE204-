Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance

I've walked a thousand miles
Met a lot of people, all races and all kinds
Love, love has no color, no
Well if you see a color, isit black, red, green or brown?

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Love will love you
If you give love a chance

Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance
Surely you can see
Take a chance, give love a chance

You try to tell me I'm a fool
Feeling the way I do
But for me there's no other way
Consider love as a flower
That grows more every hour
Every minute of every day

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Take a step to accept
Just give your love a chance
Give your love a chance
Give your love a chance

Come on, make your mind up
Surely you can understand
The meaning of ecstasy
Love will love you
If you give love a chance

Make your mind up
Surely you can understand
It's not hard for you to see
Take a step to accept
Just give your love a chance
Give your love a chance

Love has no color, no color...
I want you to to tell me, tell me...
