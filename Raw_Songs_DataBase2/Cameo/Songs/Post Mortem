Hey you, on the corner
Hey you, on the street
The whole wild world gonna get some
Just shake it, take it, fake it to the beat

Post mortem
Post mortem
Post mortem
Post mortem

(Is it for your money, huh)
It's the joint
(Is it for the money)
(He says), it's the joint
Gonna move with the move
Gonna get down with the guitar
(So good), ya'll
(Are you being serious)

Ha, ha
Whoa, yeah
Ah, ha

Say you're tired of all the dancing
And when you can move your beat
That's when you know for sure my friend
Post mortem can't be beat
Say you're tracked up
And you find it hard to move
It's okay hear what I say
You'll fall back in the groove

Ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Get me out

Is it for the money
See it's the joint, joint ask him
Is it for the money
I told ya, it's a joint
Gonna move with the move
Gonna get down with the guitar
Get ya groove on
(Serious)
