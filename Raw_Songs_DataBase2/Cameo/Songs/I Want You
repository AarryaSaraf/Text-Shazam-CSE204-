I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too, yeah

I want you to hug and hold
Be my woman every step of the way
Cause my emotions get real funky
And you can only cool me out that way
Now I don't want to have you
Just any way you want to give
Cause I'm a mean mother
and I can't be no other
and I'm gonna give all I can give

I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too, yeah

I want you

Don't try to tell me about your mamma
If you do I'll take her too
If you do I'll take her too
