Do you know girl?
As we live life we learn many many different things about ourselves
And there's one thing I've learned for sure
As our love has grown from day to day, year to year
I just can't help the way I feel about you
And with each second that passes by
I realize that, that is something tha could never change
Wise man say only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Share a nice day, would it be the same?
But I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows, surely to the sea
Darling, don't you know
That some things, some things were meant to me
Darling take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
