Ahhhhhh

Are you feeling good
Feel good together
Feel good
Gonna feel good
Feel good together
Feel good
Gonna feel good
Feel good together
Feel good
(Makes me feel so good)
Gonna feel good

When I get up in the morning
I face the world with my smiley face
And people around don't get me down, no
Cause I don't like walking 'round and 'round
Good times I feel there's so much to do
But I just get down for the best

Just good times, yeah
Good times
Having a real good time

When I get the notion to party, yeah
You best believe I don't waste no time
I know the world will change
Most people stay the same
They always talking about what's right and what's wrong

If the principles conflict with your morality
Just hang it up if that's what happens to be
(Jumping)
