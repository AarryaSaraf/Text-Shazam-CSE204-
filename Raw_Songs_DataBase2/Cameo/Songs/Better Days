I like the way you make me feel 
Honestly I do, I do
You make me cry every time you say goodbye, and the chances are 
I'll never get to see you again, no 
No one said life was easy, oh no 
There's nothing I can do, but blow a kiss, and hope for better days. 

Better days, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah, better days 
I like those better days 
You like those better days, oh yeah 

You know I'm going to try to persuade you, yeah 
Cause without your lovin I can't make it, no I can't 
Your personality blows my mind 

Tell me why, you had to say goodbye 
Do you know if I'll see you again, my friend 
Better days, come show me the way 
But for now, we'll blow a kiss and hope for better days 

Better days, oh yeah 
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah, better days 
I like those better days 
You like those better days, oh yeah
