Get down, get down
Well well

Don't stop cause we like the way you move
If you feel the funk like we do clap your hands

Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock

Everybody gather 'round, I think I found a new dance
And it don't move on my way
I dug a lot of people going left right left right
I've gotten dizzy from the rhythm which they sway
I asked a lady in the corner what's this dance she's doin'

You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock, dig it
You're doing the rock, but don't stop
You're doing the rock

Left right left right

Do the rock, do the rock
Do the rock, do the rock
Do the rock, do the rock

Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock
Rock rock rock

Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock but don't stop
Do the rock
