We played
Those games
And no one never wins, girl, yeah
Seeing all kinds of girls
Causing heartache
Never knowing
Who's to blame
But I know it's worth what we've been through 
Because 
I'm so glad to be a part of you

Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You always come through
No matter what you do
Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You're my everything

Listen to me, girl
You're always there 
When I need someone
To talk to
You're giving me more love 
Everytime
We shared our dreams
And now our dreams are realities
The whole wide world is out there
Waiting for you and me
But I know it's worth what we've been through
Because
I'm so glad to be in love with you

Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You always come through
No matter what you do
Because of everything you do
I never will stop loving you
You're my everything (everything)

Yeah, you know girl
Sometimes when I'm alone
I often wonder about the good things in my life
And I seem to realize 
What a lucky man I am
To have someone 
As special as you are

Someone to care for me
Feel for me
Hold me and touch me and love love love love me

Some people go through life
Without ever finding that special someone for them
But I have
And it's you
And it's you
You
I'm talking about you baby

I don't never ever want to stop loving you
Feeling for you
Caring about you
