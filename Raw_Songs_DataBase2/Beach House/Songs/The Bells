I can't live without you, I'll be the last one at the bar
There's just something about you, when I look out at the stars
There's a road between us, nothing too profound
And that is what took us, not the other way around

The way that blue, she cuts right through
And so the stars are breaking hearts
Like the bells, they ring out all the same

Something somebody told me, think the plane is going down
You can't take it with you, so let me buy you the next round
Whenever you were driving, I'd put my feet up on the dash
I'd imagine stories about everywhere we'd pass

The cars, the bars, the lies, the girls on Mars, the superstars
Are like the bells, they ring out all the same

And maybe one day, you'll hear them singing
You'll step outside, and they'll be ringing

The cars, the bars, the lies, the girls on Mars, the superstars
Are like the bells, they ring out all the same
