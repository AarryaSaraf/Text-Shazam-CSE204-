Something reminds me
Sweet dreams inside me
Limits shifting
Colors living through me
Just like days are ending
Just like we're pretending
At the window, let the light go
Through me

And in each silhouette
A time before the time we met
(A time before the time we met)
Here lies Violet who can't forget what happens next
(In time, you'll see, you'll see through me)

Do you recognize it?
Did you try to hide it?
All the lifetimes
Sweeping right by through you

And in each silhouette
A time before the time we met
(A time before the time we met)
Here lies Violet who can't forget what happens next
(In time, you'll see, you'll see through me)

Through you
Through me
Through you
Through me
