I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom

The color you say is black is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes, is there a righteous prize?

I met you

There's something wrong with our hearts when they beat pure they stand apart
In the black room, the light, watch the seabird fall
Real love, it finds you somewhere with your back to it

I met you

You know, you know, we belong by the stream, to the dawn
