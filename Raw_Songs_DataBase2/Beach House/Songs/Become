Keep you close to me
Oh, sweet remedy
Bright and crystalline
Take it as it comes
Holy morning sun
Rubies on my tongue
La-la, la-la

Become light
What's inside
All around you
Time goes by
Don't you cry
Become light

Love is like a fire
Light it, it goes high
Keep you close to me
La-la, la-la

Love is like a fire (Time goes by)
Light it, it goes high (What's inside)
Keep you close to me (Become light)

La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Time goes by)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (What's inside)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Become light)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Time goes by)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (What's inside)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Become light)
