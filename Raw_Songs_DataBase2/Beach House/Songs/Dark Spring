Dark red
Light years
Brought near

Cold gun
Glowing
Night scene

Started
Remain
Brought fear

I want to lie in
The cold Orion
The colour's missing
Upon the dark spring

Cold wind
Light years
Brought near

Dark gun
Glowing
Night scene

The world's colliding
A new dividing
The colour's missing
Upon the dark spring
