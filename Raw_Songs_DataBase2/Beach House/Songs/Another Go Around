Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right here
Another boy in town and his smile tells you nowhere
Another boy in town and he's right there
Another go tonight and the drugs were just right
But the one you need isn't there
Another circumstance where you're wringing your hands
Because the girl you know disappears
Another boy in town and his smile tells you nowhere
Another toy in town and he's right there

Because the game that you play seems to get in the way
And the one you need isn't there
Another circumstance where you're wringing your hands
Because the girl you know disappears
Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right there
Another go around and I'm right here beside you
Another go around and you're right there
