Never expected too much
We just fell out of touch
With your chances in life
How could you get it right?
It's okay, darling
You're just too far away for talking

You hide the hospital bills
And at night I see pills
They go blue, white, and red
They go straight to your head
In a Devil's pool
You don't know the rules
You're just somebody's fool
But, I love you

Easy come, easy go
Are you high? Are you low?
Should I stay? Should I go?
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Are you high? Are you low?

It's okay, darling
You're just too far away for talking

In a Devil's pool
You don't know the rules
You're just somebody's fool
But, I love you

Easy come, easy go
Are you high or low?
Should I stay? Should I go?
Easy come, easy go
