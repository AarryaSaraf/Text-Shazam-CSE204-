Album: Bloom

// Myth //

Drifting in and out
You see the road you're on
It came rolling down your cheek
You say just what you mean
And in between it's never as it seems

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
What comes after this
Momentary bliss
The consequence of what you do to me

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Canyon calling would they come to greet you
Let you know you're not the only one

Can't keep hanging on
To what is dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
Materialize
Or let the ashes fly

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

// Wild //

My mother said to me that I would get in trouble
Our father won't come home cause he is seeing double

Out in the endless green
Your eyes are so misleading
That's when your car pulls up
Its hood is black and gleaming

And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time

Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
You go, go on pretending

One chance to fall behind the lines that will not let you
Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you

And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time

// Lazuli //

In the blue
Of this life
Where it ends
In the night
When you couldn't see
You would come for me

Wonder eyes
Motion high
And we don't dare
Slip on by

Make us suffer
Like no other

Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go back to me

Like no other
You can't be replaced

// Other People //

So you thought it would happen
Good love goodbye
I know where no one can reach you
No I don't mind
It's your world why would you fake it
These days go by
As you turn around

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Heaven won't keep us together
Right place at the wrong time
It takes all kinds of weather
Distant new skies
Somewhere no one can reach us
These days go by
As you turn around

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough

// The Hours //

Can I wait the hours
Till you find me
Climb up to the tower
So that you could see

Violence in the flowers
Where they found you
Can I wait the hours
Would it be untrue
Climb up to the tower
So that you could see
All across the hours

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Made in your reflection
So that you could feel
Mad in your intentions
Fear it isn't real
All the recollections
Spinning in a field
Left in your possession
Till it isn't real
You say it isn't real

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Deeper than you and me
It's farther than you could see
Is it too much to ask tell me
It's all in a glance you'll see
It's deeper than you and me
It's all in a glance you'll see
It's farther than we could be
It's deeper than you and me
Frightened eyes

// Troublemaker //

Like a hand you reached out to me
The thunder rolls in with the dark
Tiny fingers on the edges
Watch it unravel
Pulling everything apart

In the back we stay together
The walls are shaking in their skin
Does it become you troublemaker
Watch them unravel you
Pulling everything apart

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

You watch the shape these things are taking
Do you cry out in your sleep
Does it become you when you're under
Your heart is racing you're taking everything too hard

When you walk away
You show me how
Come pull me under

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind you

// New Year //

All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises these promises

Can you call it
See it coming
Just enough to tell a story bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting for a new year

All you ever wanted
Is it getting away
Visions of a feeling
The footsteps at bay
You were getting stronger
Memories again
Now you're open wider
It's better this way

All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish everyday
I keep these promises these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises these promises

Won't you write a letter
On the page
In your own way
Write it in a letter
On the page
It's your own way

You were getting wiser
It's better this way
Faces in the mirror
Memories again
Now look to a feeling
It's lighter than breath
All you ever wanted
Is it getting away

Can you call it
See it coming
Just enough to tell a story bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting for the ending of an era
Can you call it
See it coming
Just enough to tell a story bout a
Portrait of a young girl waiting for the new year

// Wishes //

The roses on the lawn
Don't know which side you're on
In a daze it will change
Wishes on a wheel
Wishes on a wheel

The voices in the hall
Will carry on their talking
Carry weight you can't take
Wishes on a wheel
Is it even real

The contact that you make
The moment when a memory aches
Who can tell
You do it well
Wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel

One in your life
It happens once and rarely twice
One in your life
It happens once and rarely twice

The roses on the lawn
Won't know which side you're on
On that hill
Forever still
Wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel
Wishes on a wheel
Wishes on a wheel

// On The Sea //

Out on the sea we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit living
Wouldn't you like to know how far you've got left to go

Somebody's child nobody made you
It's not what you stole it's what they gave you
In or out you go
In your silence your soul

Would you rather go unwilling
Your heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left

In hind of sight no peace of mind
Where you begin and I'm defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me

In hind of sight no peace of mind
Where it begins and we're defined
Shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes and swallows me in

Whistle to a friend gentle till the end
Anyway in a name she takes shape just the same

// Irene //

Though you hardly know her
The light's on its way
The hand that rests upon it
Still wanna stay

No way of recognizing
The cat knows the call
Fair child is rising
There's no mystery at all

It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
You'll be waiting
You'll be waiting

It's a strange paradise
