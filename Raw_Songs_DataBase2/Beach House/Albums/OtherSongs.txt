// Alien //

City light
White on white
In your eyes
Stings your face
Alien
Before it slips away

Paper dolls
On the wires
Set on fire
[?] which comes
Between us
Takes us all away

Sorry sometimes
I get carried away

Up on the movie screen
Black beauty limousines for you
These dreams of chelsea days
Fake flowers to the grave for you
Helpless and glimmering
Dear Sundays up all night with you

Sorry sometimes
I get carried away
Sorry sometimes
I get carried away
Sorry sometimes
(Helpless and glimmering) (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away
Sorry sometimes
(Up on the movie screen) (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away
Sorry sometimes
(Helpless and glimmering) (Fake flowers to the grave for you)
I get carried away
