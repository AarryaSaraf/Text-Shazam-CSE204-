Album: ThankYourLuckyStars

// Majorette //

Imitation red carnation
Nothing is new and either are you

It's what you say you don't do
Bottom of your well, that's where you fell

Majorette like there's nothing left
If there was nothing left to lose
Then you'd have something to prove

And you would never tip your hat
Has it come to that
Watch it spin like that

Watch you spin like that

// She's So Lovely //

She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you

From the way that her eyes are shaped
It's making me sick

With her head on my shoulder
Waking up barely just to believe

For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner

She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is stay away from you

// All Your Yeahs //

Hush don't you cry
In the next life

She takes me to the water
Don't say a word

And when I ask her
Is she doing alright
She's a rollercoaster
And yeah, she's a fire in the night

Lay your dead flowers
All in a row
Sooner or later
We're gonna let them go

And when she asks me
Are we doing it right
Come a little closer
You've got nothing left to hide

Hush don't you cry
In the next life

And when they ask us
Are we happy inside
We're a rollercoaster
And yeah, we're a fire in the night

What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love

All your yeahs
What can you say
All your yeahs
It's your life
Do you right
Give them love
And give them away

// One Thing //

One thing yea about you
You always yea you always know
What's happening
Perfect in the morning
And you ruin it in the evening

Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
And up the stairs
She never really sleeps

Closer now in the mirror
Your reflection, my reflection
Growing nearer
Pressure oh the pressure
In confession

Hallelujah

Remarkable
When a likeness comes
You're always out of reach
The faces in the secondhand
A little fuck off kiss

Remarkable
That you're lucky just to meet
Come down the hill
Cause she never really sleeps

// Common Girl //

You used to live in this part of town
Until you hit the ground
She makes movies where she cries on cue
She still lives downtown

But it's ok
Cause she's common anyway
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, who pay the bills

She's the one with the lazy eye
Promises never come filled
Takes the pills and hides the notices
Cartoon rings of ill will

But it's ok
Cause she's common in every way
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills

Nobody special done a good thing
For somebody else
Taking advantage of that good thing
For nobody else

// The Traveller //

When I come home
You're just lying there
Face against the wall
Never had a care

I am just a traveller
There's no light in this room
And the body's aching at night

Would I be acting up
If i said it's not enough

Who knows who else who is with
No one is with the traveller
There's a light in my eyes
And a future invisible now

Heard it's your birthday
Candles in a row
Better blow them quick
Before they're melting on the floor

You were never a traveller
There's no light in your room
And the bodies don't ache in the night

Would I be acting up
If i said not that much

Who else would do anything for the traveller
There's a light in her eyes
And a future visible touch

I was looking out of the window at the sky
Starless vigil of a life that has gone by
Saturn turning and I feel there's not much more
For a vision of the night turn off your light

// Elegy To The Void //

To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Disappearing in the mirror

Watch it as it burns out
(It is just a flame)
Freckle faced young virgin
(It is just a game)

Platinum vision
Bringing you down again and again
Again and again

Black clock looming distant
You're a great white
They were never listening
Waiting for the light to come again

Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Garden of remains
Diamond maiden chained

To your sons and daughters
Bending at the altar
Don't you disappear in the mirror again and again
Again and again

Deep beneath the waves
White-winged birds of May
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night

Deep beneath the waves
Lilies of the day
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night

Deep beneath the waves
White-winged birds of May
Run from hollow hills
Walk into the night

// Rough Song //

In the middle of the party
Found a hole to be sorry
Through the glass
Drank a memory of her face

All the charm in the evening
Peridot television
Loveless another
Daughter and mother

Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party
Her story unravels like a ribbon in the windy distance

Schoolgirls were praying
Lace curtains fading
Fern of the forest
Dearly beloved

Hard to hear she spit on you and made your bloody nose more bloody
Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave it

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
She needs to leave it

// Somewhere Tonight //

Pink and blue were dancing
Empty floor, shadows lancing

Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Red and blue combination
Old man finds elation

Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Love me see what I see tonight
Let us find elation

Somewhere in a ballroom tonight
Somewhere in a ballroom tonight

Nowhere on an ordinary night
