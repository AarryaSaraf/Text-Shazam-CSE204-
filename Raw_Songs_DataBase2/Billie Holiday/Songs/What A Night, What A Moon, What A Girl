What a night!
What a moon'
What a boy!
What a moon'
What a night!
What a boy!
Those white clouds hang in the air
Like toy balloons
Say, they just hang in the air
That's made for honeymoons
What a hug!

What a kiss!

What a boy!

What a game!  Oh, what bliss!
What a boy!

Is it a wonder
My heart is full of joy?
What a night!
What a moon'
What a boy!
