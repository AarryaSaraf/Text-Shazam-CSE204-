Oh clouds above me
Where are the birds that used to sing?
Everything's wrong
Oh where is their song of love?

Where is the one
Who said he loved me
Far, like those clouds he used to bring
Can it be true there's somebody new to love?
Listen my heart
Don't feel so bad
Think of the kisses we knew
You know my heart
The moments we had
Maybe he's missing them too
Where is the sun?

Oh clouds above me
Don't lake the dreams to which I cling
Where is the sun?
Oh where is the one I love?
