Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me,
The way you looked when we meet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget. 
I hear you whisper,
I'll always lave you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget.

So I must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the nigh.

Each little moment
Is clear before me,
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget.
