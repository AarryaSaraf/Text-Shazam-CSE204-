Remember the night
The night you said, "I love you", remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you, remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot to remember

Remember the night
The night you said, "I love you", remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you, remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot to remember
