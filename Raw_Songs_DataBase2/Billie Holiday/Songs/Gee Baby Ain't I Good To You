What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world, too good for a girl that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, a big Cadillac car and everything
Its love that makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world, too good for a guy that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, big Cadillac car and everything
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world too good for a girl that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, big Cadillac car and everything
Its love that makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
