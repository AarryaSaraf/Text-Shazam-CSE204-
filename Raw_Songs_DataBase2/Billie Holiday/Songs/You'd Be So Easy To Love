I know too well that I'm
Just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me

I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame for love

You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love
