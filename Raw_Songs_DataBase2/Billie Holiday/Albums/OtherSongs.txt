// Ain't Nobody's Business If I Do //

There ain't nothin' I can do or nothin' I can say
That folks don't criticize me but I'm going to do
Just as I want to anyway
And don't care just what people say

If I should take a notion, to jump into the ocean
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I go to church on Sunday, then cabaret all day Monday
Ain't nobody's business if I do

If my man ain't got no money and I say, "Take all of mine, honey"
Ain't nobody's business if I do
If I give him my last nickel and it leaves me in a pickle
Ain't nobody's business if I do

Well, I'd rather my man would hit me
Than follow him to jump up and quit me
Ain't nobody's business if I do
I swear I won't call no copper, if I'm beat up by my papa
Ain't nobody's business if I do, nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business, nobody's business if I do

// All Of Me //

All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you

Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them

Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the part
That once was my heart
So why not take all of me

All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you

Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I'll never use them

Your goodbye
Left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you

You took the best
So why not take the rest
Baby, take all of me

// Am I Blue? //

Am I blue, am I blue
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you
Am I blue, you'd be too
If each plan with your man done fell through

Was a time I was his only one
But now I'm the sad and lonely one, lonely
Was I gay till today
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue

Was I gay till today
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue
Oh he's gone, he left me, am I blue

// Big Stuff //

So you cry
What's it about, baby?
You ask why
Blues had to go and pick you
So you go
Down to the shore, kid's stuff
Don't you know
There's honey in the store for you, big stuff
Let's take a ride on my gravy train
The door open wide

So you stare
Call it despair, baby
Don't you care
I'm on the square about you
Let's have a try
It maybe that you're my guy
Let's take a ride on my gravy train
The door open wide
Come in from out of the rain

// Carelessly //

How carelessly
You gave me your heart
And carelessly I broke it, sweetheart
I took each tender kiss you gave to me
Every kiss made you a slave to me

Then carelessly
I told you good-bye
But now at night I wake up and cry
I wish I knew a way to find the love
I threw away so carelessly

// Crazy He Calls Me //

I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I

// Deep Song //

Lonely grief is hounding me
Like the lonely shadow hounding me
It's always there, just out of sight
Like a fragling tree on a lightening night

Lonely wind cries out my name
Sad as haunted music in the rain
It's born of grief and born of woe
But I hear it call and I've got to go

Where can I be headed for
The blues call it my north to lick my heart once more
Love lives in a lonely land
Where there's no helping hand to understand

Why does it bring this hate to me
Why it don't matter why
I only know misery
Has to be part of me

Never hope to count on love
To be a partner of that Heaven up above
Never hope to understand, love is a barrel land
A lonely land, a lonely land

// Don't Explain //

Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
Nothing rates above you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong, don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain

// Don't Know If I'm Comin' Or Goin' //

You've got me on the road
Runnin' to and fro
Lookin' high and low
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you

I run up across the town
Chasing up and down
Having you around
I don't know if I'm coming or going
Since I fell for you

// Easy Living //

Living for you, is easy living.
It's easy to live when you're in love.
And, I'm so in love,
There's nothing in life, but you.

I'll never regret the years I'm giving.
They're easy to give when you're in love.
I'm happy to do whatever I do, for you.

For you...maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun.
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand.
Darling, it's grand.
They just don't understand.

Living for you is easy living.
It's easy to live when you're in love.
And, I'm so in love,
There's nothing in life, but you.

// Fine And Mellow //

My man don't love me
Treats me oh so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high-draped pants
Stripes are really yellow
But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

But if you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home every day
If you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home every day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on

Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone

// Gloomy Sunday //

Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will
Never awaken you
Not where the black coach
Of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of
Ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have
Decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are sad
I know, let them not weep
Let them know
That I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday
Dreaming
I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of
My heart
Dear

Darling I hope that my dream
Never haunted you
My heart is telling you
How much I wanted you
Gloomy Sunday

// Guilty //

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do?
If it's a crime than I'm guilty 
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I take on the blame
You say you're through
You'll go your way but I'll always feel just the same
Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If thats a crime than I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

[repeat]

// I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me //

Your eyes so blue
Your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe you're in love with me

You're telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you far above me
I just can't image that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe you're in love with me

// I Can't Give You Anything But Love //

I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Scheme a while dream a while
We're sure to find
Happiness and I guess

All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day
You know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything but love

// I'll Be Seeing You //

I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day and through

In that small cafe
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

// I'll Look Around //

I'll look around until I've found
Someone who laughs like you

I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear

I'll look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Wont be the old love I always knew

I know somewhere spring must fill the air
With sweetness just as rare
As the flower that you gave me to wear

I'll look around and when I've found
Someone who sighs like you
I'll know this love I'm dreaming of
Wont be the old love I always knew

// I'm Gonna Lock My Heart And Throw Away The Key //

I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key
Cos I'm tired of all those
tricks you played on me
I'm gonna turn my back on love
Gonna mock the moon above
Seal all my windows up with tin
So that the love bug can't get in
Gonna park my romance right along the curb
Hang a sign upon my heart
"Please don't disturb"
And if I never fall in love again
That's soon enough for me
I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key

And if I never fall in love again
That's soon enough for me
I'm gonna lock my heart
And throw away the key

// I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm //

The snow is snowin'
The wind is blowin'
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember
A worst December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat
Off with my gloves
I need no overcoat
I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

[bridge]

My heart's on fire
The flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

// Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?) //

I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

// No More //

You ain't gonna bother me no more
Nohow
Love just goes so far
No more
Woke up this morining and found
I didn't care for you no more
Nohow
Never felt so good before
You're down to my size
It's over and done
So honey, step down from your throne
That look in your eyes

Don't bother me none
Can take or leave you alone
From my window
Skys ain't grey nomore
Not now
Here's the day
That I've been waiting for
Got only one heart
One heart with no spares
Must save it for loving
Somebody who cares
So you ain't gonna bother me
No more, no more

// P.S. I Love You //

Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool, the folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all, I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you

Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all

Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you

Write to the browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And I burned a hole in the dining room table
Now let me think, I guess that's all

Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you, love you, love you

// Pennies From Heaven //

Oh, every time it rains
It rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know
Each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven

You'll find your fortune fallin'
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down

Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

// Sentimental And Melancholy //

Sentimental and melancholy
Whenever I think about you
It's only a mood,
A brief interlude
That's better described as just feeling blue

I suppose that it's just my folly
To keep it alive as I do
But it's a kind of sugar coated misery
And foolish as it seems
I thought I'd like to be
Sentimental and melancholy
Whenever I think about you

// That's Life, I Guess //

Sometimes I wonder what's in store for me
Your love could open heaven's door to me
But you don't care a straw for me
That's life, I guess

My days and nights are stark and hard with you
My sugar kisses taste like salt to you
But why should I find fault with you?
That's life, I guess

The world was bright when you loved me
Sweet was the touch of your lips
The world went dark when you left me
And then there came a total eclipse

Nobody knows how cruel fate can be
How close together love and hate can be
Goodbye, just clean the slate for me
That's life, I guess

// The Man I Love //

Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
That's meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love

// The Mood That I'm In //

Never dared to have your arms around me
Not that I considered it a sin
But tonight I want your arms around me
It's the mood that I'm in
Can it be the music that they're playin'
Or the magic of the violin
That intrigues my heart to obeyin'
It's the mood that I'm in
Maybe it's the cocktail that I'm sippin'
Tonight I'm so romantically inclined
So speak to me of love
In words so tender
Let the rhapsody of life begin
I could give my heart in sweet surrender
It's the mood I'm in

// Them There Eyes //

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
Them There Eyes
And you have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
With Them There Eyes

They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somethin'
With Them There Eyes

You better look out lil brown eyes...if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
Oh baby...Them There Eyes

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
[musical echo]
You have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
[musical echo]
They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
fallin', no stallin'
In a great big way for you
My heart is jumpin', you've started somthin'
With Them There Eyes

You better look out lil brown eyes, if you're wise
Sparkle
Bubble
Get you in a whole lot of trouble..
I'm lookin for the boy with the whisful eyes
I fell in love..
With Them There Eyes

// There Is No Greater Love //

There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than that you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
and to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone

There is no greater love in all the world; it's true
No greater love than what I feel for you

// What Is This Thing Called Love? //

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and trew it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

// When You're Smiling //

When you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing
When you're laughing
The sun comes shining thru
But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing be happy again
Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you

// Where Is The Sun? //

Oh clouds above me
Where are the birds that used to sing?
Everything's wrong
Oh where is their song of love?

Where is the one
Who said he loved me
Far, like those clouds he used to bring
Can it be true there's somebody new to love?
Listen my heart
Don't feel so bad
Think of the kisses we knew
You know my heart
The moments we had
Maybe he's missing them too
Where is the sun?

Oh clouds above me
Don't lake the dreams to which I cling
Where is the sun?
Oh where is the one I love?

// Who Loves You? //

Who loves you
Ask yourself the question
Who loves you, sweetheart
And tel me who thinks of you
A million times a day
And who's blue and lonely, honey
When you're away

Say, who needs you
Needs you every minute
Who fell for you from the start
Oh who just longs for your caresses
You don't have to take three guesses
Who loves you, sweetheart

// Why Was I Born? //

Why was I born
Why am I livin'
What do I get
What am I givin'
Why do I want for things
I dare not hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew
Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I cry
You never hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Oh baby why was I born
To love you

// You Better Go Now //

You better go now
Because I like you much, too much

You have a way with you
You ought to know now
Just why I like you very much
The night was gay with you

There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be spring

I want you so now
You have lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because
I like you much, too much

There's the moon above
And it gives my heart a lot of swing
In your eyes there's love
And the way I feel it must be spring

I want you so now
You have lips I love to touch
You better go now
You better go, because
I like you much, too much
You better go, because
I like you much, too much

// You're My Thrill //

You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

Hmmm-nothing seems to matter
Hmmm-here's my heart on a silver platter
Where's my will
Why this strange desire
That keeps morning higher
When I look at you
I cann't keep still
You're my thrill
