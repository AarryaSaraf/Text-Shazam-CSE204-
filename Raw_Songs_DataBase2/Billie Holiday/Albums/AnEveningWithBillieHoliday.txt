Album: AnEveningWithBillieHoliday

// Stormy Weather //

Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and mis'ry everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rockin' chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, ev'rything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rockin' chair will get me
All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, ev'rything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

// Lover, Come Back To Me //

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
Honey I get oh so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
Ain't no wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back
Lover come back
Lover come back to me
Lover come back
Lover come back
Lover come back to me
Lover come on back
Lover come on back
Lover come on back to me
Come on back to me girl
Come on back girl
Lover come back to me

// Yesterdays //

Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreamin' of
Yesterdays

Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love

For then gay youth was mine
Truth was mine
Joyous free in flame and life
Then sooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreamin' of
Yesterdays

// Tenderly //

The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh, were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly

Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh, were we

The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly

// I Can't Face The Music //

Breeze, stop moanin' those weird melodies
My man has left me
And I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

Rain, your rhythm on my window pane
Drives me insane because
I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

My heart is so broken
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy
And if He don't help me, so help me
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me

I'm gonna end this misery
My man has left me
And I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

My heart is so broken
I've spoken to the Lord for sympathy
And if He don't help me, so help me
It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me

I'm gonna end this misery
My man has left me
And I can't face the music
Without singin' the blues

I can't face the music

// Remember //

Remember the night
The night you said, "I love you", remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you, remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot to remember

Remember the night
The night you said, "I love you", remember?
Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you, remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot
You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot to remember
