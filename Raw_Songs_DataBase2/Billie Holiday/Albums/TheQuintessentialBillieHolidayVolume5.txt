// My Man //

It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore

// He's Funny That Way //

I'm not much to look at
nothing to see
just glad I'm living
and lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar
ain't worth a cent
he doesn't hollar
he'd live in a tent
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way

Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away
But why should I leave him
Why should I go
He'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that man mad about me
He's funny that way

Never had nothing
No one to care
That's why I seem to have
More than my share
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

When I hurt his feelings
Once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some better gal
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

// Nice Work If You Can Get It //

The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if
Won't you tell me how?

// Born To Love //

There's something that rules our destiny
Right from the first day of our birth
Altough you may not care for me
You have your mission on this earth
You were born to love
Sure as you live
Born with everything heaven could give
You have eyes and they express
Love at a glance
You have lips who's tenderness
Speak of romance
Like a dream of love, lovely to see
You're the angel of my destiny
And to think that you have found
Your place on earth only to be
Born to love and be loved by me

// Without Your Love //

Without your love
I'm like a song without words
Just like a nest without birds
Without your love
Fine sun above
Will never shine at my door
My life holds nothing in store
Without your love
I rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

I've rode the crest of a wave
With you beside me
Now who's to guide me
Because I'm lost at sea
Without your love
I'm like a plane without wings
A violin with no strings
Without your love

// Getting Some Fun Out Of Life //

When we want to love, we love
When we want to kiss, we kiss
With a little petting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
When we want to work. we work
When we want to play, we play
In a happy setting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
Maybe we do the right things
Maybe we do the wrong
Spending each day
Just wending our way along
When we want to sing, we sing
When we want to dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting
Some fun out of life

Maybe we do the right things
Maybe we do the wrong
Spending each day
Just wending our way along
But when we want to sing, we sing
When we want to dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting
Some fun out of life

// Who Wants Love? //

Who wants love?
Love is a joy we borrow
Pay back in tears tomorrow
So who wants love?

Who wants love?
Something to fill your heart with
So very soon to part with
So who wants love?

Love is a dream of weaving
Moonbeams in patterns rare
Love is a child believing
Stories of castles in the air
So who wants love
I'll go away without it
I know too much about it
Who wants love

// Trav'lin' All Alone //

I'm so weary and all alone
Feel tired like heavy stone
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Who will see and who will care
Bout this load that I must bear
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone
Prayers are said to heaven above
'bout my burdens,woes and love

Head bowed down with misery
Nothing now appeals to me
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

Give me just another day
There's one thing I want to say
Friends are well when all is gold
Leave you always when you're old
Trav'lin', trav'lin' all alone

// Things Are Looking Up //

Things are looking up
I've been looking the landscape over
And it's covered with four leaf clover
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me
Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

// Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man //

Oh listen, sister
I love my mister man and I can't tell you why
Dere ain't no reason why I should love dat man
It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan
De chimbley's smokin'
De roof is leakin' in
But he don't seem to care
He can be happy
With jes' a sip of gin
I even loves him when his kisses got gin

Fish got to swim and birds got to fly
I got to love man till I die
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
Tell me he's lazy
Tell me he's slow
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe, I know
Can't help lovin' that man of mine
When he goes away
Dat's a rainy day
And when he comes back dat day is fine
The sun will shine
He can come home as late as can be
Home without him ain't no home to me
Can't help lovin' that man of mine

// My First Impression Of You //

My first impression of you
Was like the sight of flowers in spring
You were a glorious thing to see

My first impression of you
Was something indescribably new
I stood there looking at you
Smiling at me

If you had stepped right out of heaven
It wouldn't surprise me more
I thought you were an angel
From heaven's door

It may sound silly, but true
My heart just stopped
When I caught your eye
So overwhelming
Was my first impression of you

// When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You) //

When you're smiling
When you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you
When you're laughing
When you're laughing
The sun comes shining thru
But when you're crying
You bring on the rain
So stop your sighing be happy again
Keep on smiling
'Cause when you're smiling
The whole world smiles with you

// Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me //

Your eyes so blue
Your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can't believe you're in love with me

You're telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go
They can't believe that you're in love with me
I have always placed you far above me
I just can't image that you love me
And after all is said and done
To think that I'm the lucky one
I can't believe you're in love with me

// If Dreams Come True //

If dreams come true
I'll be with you
I love that smile in your eyes
You see a dream in the skies
In your caress there is happiness
And love in view
If dreams come true

// Now They Call It Swing //

Once they called it ragtime
And it had its fling
It's the same old syncopation
Now they call it swing

Then they played it jazz time
To a buck-and-wing
Once again it sweeped the nation
Now they call it swing

When singers used to sing
They would go hot cha
But with this modern thing
Now they go dru-du du, dra-da-da

Rhythm has its seasons
Summer, fall and spring
But for seven silly reasons
Someone pulled the string
And they started dancing
Now they call it swing

// On The Sentimental Side //

If you wonder why I'm near you
Even though I've been denied
I'm inclined to be a little
On the sentimental side
I suppose I should forget you
If I had an ounce of pride
But I guess I can't help being
On the sentimental side
I should act gay
Laugh it off and say, farewell
Say it just didn't wear well
But I'm not that way
I'm in hopes you'll think it over
And perhaps be satisfied
With a simple sort of person
On the sentimental side

I should act gay
Laugh it off and say, farewell
Say it just didn't wear well
But I'm not that way
I'm in hopes you'll think it over
And perhaps be satisfied
With a simple sort of person
On the sentimental side

// Back In Your Own Backyard //

The bird with feathers of blue
Is waiting for you
Back in your own backyard
You'll see your castles in Spain
Through your window pane
Back in your own backyard
Oh you can go to the East
Go to the West
But someday you'll come
Weary at heart
Back where you started from
You'll find your happiness lies
Right under your eyes
Back in your own backyard

The bird with feathers of blue
Is waiting for you
Back in your own backyard
You'll see your castles in Spain
Through your window pane
Back in your own backyard
Oh you can go to the East
Go to the West
But someday you'll come
Weary at heart
Back where you started from
You'll find your happiness lies
Right under your eyes
Back in your own backyard

// When A Woman Loves A Man //

Maybe he's not much, just another man
Doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man
She'll just string along
All through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman love a man
She'll be the first one to praise him
When he's goin' strong
The last one to blame him
When everything's wrong
It's such a one-sided game that they play
But women are funny that way
Tell her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how it goes
When a woman loves a man
Tel I her she's a fool
She'll say yes, I know
But I love him so
And that's how if goes
When a woman loves a man
