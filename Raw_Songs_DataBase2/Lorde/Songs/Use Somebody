I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me

Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shake the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah

Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
