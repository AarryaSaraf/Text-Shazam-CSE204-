Every night I go
Every night I go
Sneaking out the door
I lie a little more
Baby I'm helpless

There's something about the night
And the way it hides all the things I like
Little black butterflies
Deep inside me

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
She saw me hurt this way?

Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name
Yeah, here we are again
It's nearly perfect

What would my mama do
She knew about me and you?
What would my daddy say
He saw me hurt this way?
