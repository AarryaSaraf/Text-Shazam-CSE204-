No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom

All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky

See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?

Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be
