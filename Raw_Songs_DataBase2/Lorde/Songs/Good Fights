Face the world, tell your friends
You don't really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don't get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight
