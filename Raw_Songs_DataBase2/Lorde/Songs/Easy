Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy

Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of your flows
Easy, easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, easy

Oh, easy, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Thought it would suck, but now it's
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Oh, easy, easy

Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy
