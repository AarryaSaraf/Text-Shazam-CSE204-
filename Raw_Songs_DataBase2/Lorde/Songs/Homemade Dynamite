A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Now you know it's really gonna blow (boo)

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
