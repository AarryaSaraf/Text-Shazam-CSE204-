The night I went under
And there was no one around
Nothing to swim to
Not the sky, not the ground
I heard you speak to me
And said to, "Just go down"

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

And I keep on waiting
For someone to save me
I keep waiting for someone to ask me, "What is your name?"

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

I've seen worse before
I've had trouble breathing
I've had scrapes and scars
Healing from lacerations

Bending from days on end
I get up and walk away

Through all the lies I told before
Well now, they've all come true
Never mind this screaming in the cold

And when I caught a glimpse of you
You were laughing at me and looking away
And I did everything I could
To try to get you to stay

I pass through dimensions
And leaving this plane
Turning into the ether
It changes everything

Swept away
In peaceful tranquility
I wish that I could stay

I can't hear at all
I've had trouble speaking
Will this heal my heart?
Relive the never-ending
Bending for days on end
I'll get up and walk away
