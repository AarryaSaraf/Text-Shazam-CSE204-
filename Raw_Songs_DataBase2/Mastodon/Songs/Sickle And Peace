Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace

Please excuse the madness
Of the situation I am in
Are we only united
For we both share the cause of this

You choose to apply logic
It's hard to ply where there is none
My detonation's unknown
Allow the man to walk in his shoes from here

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

Justifying all your control
I cease to mourn what never could be
No feeling's ever final
Just another scar I wear and hold dear

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes

Falling down and losing ground
Save me from myself
All I've seen and all I know
I've not been this low

Now I stand up on my own
Learning from myself
Where I've been and where I'll go
Still remains unknown

Death comes and brings with him sickle and peace
Shelter from storms come with long flowing robes
