Get me out of this place
Get me out of this atmosphere
Let me go and I'll never see your face no more
Death is running the race
Demon come for the ride
And the hounds of hell are close behind

Clearing out the old
Make way for the new
Leave our separate ways
Lay waste to you

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road

Get us out of the light
Go beyond the horizon
It's the only chance we have if we want to survive
Burning into the night
Trying to get out of underground
Say goodbye to the sulfur and the fire

We have got to believe
Vow to never return
Drag you off your knees
Lay waste to none

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road

We've got to get out of here
And leave you standing alone
Darkness is everywhere
Burn the ash, hit the road
