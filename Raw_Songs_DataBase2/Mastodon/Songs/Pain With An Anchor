Oh, my dear
Look what we've done here
My greatest fear
A pain with an anchor
The taste of defeat

Oh, my dear
Look what we've come to
We've shattered serene

I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers

Oh my dear
The damage is done here
I disappear
A love with no anchor
In the depths of the sea

I've turned the grief to medicine
Into my mouth will enter
The hardest pill I've ever had to swallow down
As karma whispers
