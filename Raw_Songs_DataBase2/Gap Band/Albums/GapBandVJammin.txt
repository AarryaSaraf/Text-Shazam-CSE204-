// Shake A Leg //

Oh, you left me
With the feelings in my hand
You gave me my papers back
Now I am a free man

So you know that coming back
It's not a part of the plan
What do you think of me
I am a free man, baby

Oh, you left me
At the wrong time
She was a devil in disguise
'Cause she was so fine

You thought you could make me beg
Baby, I'm gonna shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mm-hmm
Shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg

Oh, you left me
At the wrong time
She was a devil in disguise
'Cause she was so fine

You thought you were coming back
But that ain't part of my plan
What do you think of that
I'm now a free man, baby

You said you love me, babe
It was part of the plan
First you said you'll be right by my side
I try to do all I can

You thought you could make me beg
But, baby, I'm gonna
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby

Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby

Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg

Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, whoo!
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, yeah

Shake a leg, shake a leg, oh...
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby, hey
Shake a leg, shake a leg

You burned the fire on me
I'm gonna make you see!
Shake a leg, shake a leg...

// Smile //

Smile, you owe it to yourself
And when there's nothing left
But troubles and heartache
You just smile
No matter what the price
You brighten up your life
Don't you worry 'bout it

Smile when loved ones turn away
There'll be a brighter day
If you just smile
Baby, when you are smiling
Baby, if you just smile

Smile when problems get you down
It hurts so much to frown
Hold your head up high
And you will smile
When loved ones turn away
Just walk away instead
And you will smile
Baby, smile

You just smile
When loved ones turn a head
You just walk away instead
And you will smile

If you don't pay attention
I just want to mention
That I never wanna see you again

I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it

It reminds me of how I love you so
I'd like your friends and the world to know
That you're my love

Hope that you will understand
That when I reach and touch your hand
I only want to be your man
Please don't say no

// Someday //

Let us say the words we feel
Wherein our hearts and our minds are still
The teachings of the masters in our past
They created special dreams
That included quiet streams
We're all of us together, we'll have to stand

And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
(We're together)
Someday we'll all be free

Once to you we say again
Let's walk together hand in hand
And take us to this place
Where the masters stood
Take us to the place with the quiet streams
We like to shake the hand
Of Dr. Martin Luther King
All of us together, all brotherhood

People, people, you best believe
That someday we'll all be free
You best believe that
Someday we'll all be free
You best believe that
Someday we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free

People, you best believe
(That someday we'll all be free)
That we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free

Play it, Stevie

Take us to the place of quiet streams
We like to shake the hand
Of Dr. Martin Luther King
All of us together
Together as one, as one

People, you best believe
That someday we'll all be free
Oh, people
That someday we'll all be free
You better believe
That someday we'll all be free
(People, all be free)
That someday we'll all be free
(Someday, people)
That someday we'll all be free

You better believe
That someday we'll all be free
People, freedom
That someday we'll all be free
(People)
That someday we'll all be free
(People, shakin' hands together)
That someday we'll all be free
(We're gonna be walking)
(And we're talking again)

Stand inside our pride
Shaking hands and talking
There'll be no more prejudices
We'll all be able to talk again
And walk again
In the land of free

That someday we'll all be free
You promised that someday
That someday we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free
Yes, we will
All you gotta do is believe
That someday

Mm-hmm
Just you wait and see
We'll be able to walk and talk again
Thank you master
Someday we'll be able to walk side by side
Thank you, Jesus...
