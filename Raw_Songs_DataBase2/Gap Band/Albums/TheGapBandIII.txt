// When I Look In Your Eyes //

There's things about me
That you never knew
How I go crazy each day
Wishing for you
I don't know your name
But I'd like to get over with you
'Cause I'm hot on your trail
You know that it's true

Because I like you
I hope you like me too
'Cause I've been waiting
A long, long time
Just to talk to you
You, you, you, you

When I look in your eyes
Something comes over me
Girl, I'm hypnotized
When I'm with you, can't you see
When I say that I'm glad to know you
The pleasure is mine
I've been wanting to meet you
For such a long, long time

Don't wanna say it in a letter
Don't wanna say it on the phone
I'll meet you at home
Where we can be alone

Because I like you
I hope you like me too
I've been waiting
Such a long, long time
Just to talk to you
You, you, you, you

Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm

When I look in your eyes
Something comes over me
Girl, I'm hypnotized
When I'm with you, can't you see
When I say that I'm glad to know you
The pleasure is mine
I've been wanting to meet you
For such a long, long time, hey-hey

When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive...

When I look in your eyes, whoo!
When I look in your eyes
Girl, you're gonna hypnotize, whoo!
Whoo!

When I look in your eyes
Whoo!
When I look in your eyes
Whoo!
When I look in your eyes...

// Yearning For Your Love //

The time has come for us to stop messin' around
'Cause don't you know that I like havin' you around
In my life
Oh, baby

So many times I want to hold you, oh, so near
I want to say I love you softly in your ear
Oh, baby
Don't keep running

My heart is yearning for your love
'Cause my heart is yearning for your love

You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life

So many times I need to have you by my side
To be my friend, my lover and my guide
Oh, baby

// Burn Rubber On Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me) //

Woo, I gave you my money, I gave you my time
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Are you serious, I'm just curious
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

Never, ever had a lover
Who put the pedal to the mettle
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Then you upped and ran away
And made me just go crazy

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover 
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burn rubber on me, Charlie
Oh, no, no, no

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

You told me to go up the block
And get you a strawberry pop
When I got back to the flat
You had burned rubber out the back

I went to the closet and saw no clothes
All I saw was hangers and poles
I went to the phone and called your mother
And told me you had burned rubber on me, Charlie
OH, no, no [x13]

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

I never, ever had a lover 
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burned rubber on me, Charlie
OH, no, no, no, no, oh, no, yeah, yeah

Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt, me girl
Just because you're not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

Just because your not for real
Why you wanna hurt me, girl

You took my money, you took my time
Made me think everything was fine
Like the clock on the wall, said ding-ding-dong
Got to find another lover that won't be gone

She won't put the pedal to the metal
And burn rubber, burn rubber, on me, Charlie
NO, no, no, no

I never, ever had a lover
Who put the pedal to the metal 
And burned rubber on me, Charlie
NO, no, no, no, no, no [repeat 8x]

// Nothin' Comes To Sleepers //

With the sunshine comes the dawning of a day
Still another dream has come then slipped away
Scattered visions of the things you want to be
Make you open up your mind and try to see
How to make dreams come true

Oh, life is but a dream
But nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Oh, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Sitting all alone you wonder what is real
Is it what you see or is it what you feel
While you're wondering the day has passed away
No more time for wondering it is time to pray
God, make our dreams come true

Oh, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Whoa, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

And God, make our dreams come true

Whoa, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Far beyond the sky the source of everything
Seems to hold within his hands your destiny
In the twinkling of an eye your life could change
Turn the sunshine in your life to tears of pain
And God made my dreams come true

Whoa, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Oh, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Whoa, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
But a dream
But a dream

// Are You Living //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down
You can't go runnin' with your feet off the ground
Sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong
In this world, situations make you very strong

Keep the faith, never bend, be yourself to the end
Don't look back, keep your head towards the sky
Life works out in the sweet by and by
While you give life everything you've got, mm-hmm

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder, wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder, wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got
Hey, hey, whoo!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
I can't go runnin' with your feet off the ground
Sometimes I'm right but sometimes I'm wrong
Situations makes me very strong

Keep the faith, never bend, be yourself to the end
Don't look back, keep your head towards the sky
Life works out in the sweet by and by
Are you giving life, giving life
Are you giving life, giving, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder, wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got, hey, hey

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder
Make you wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got, hey, hey
(Horns!)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder, wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got, hey, hey

Are you living, are you living
What you giving, what you giving
Makes you wonder, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Makes you wonder)
Are you giving life everything
Everything, can you feel it
Everything, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Are you giving, whoa-whoa...

Whoa-whoa, what you giving

Are you giving life what you got
Yeah, yeah...

// Sweet Caroline //

Sweet Caroline 
Loved you with all of my heart 
Sweet Caroline 
don't want to ever part 
that wouldn't be very smart 
I need you for my wife 
time's too short in my life 

How I love you 

Sweet Caroline 
told me you believed in me 
Sweet Caroline 
all the time deceiving me 
telling me that you needed me 
can't see how you're leaving me 
don't know how to make you see 
that I love you 

Ooooooo Sweet Caroline 
Oh Sweet Caroline Oh Oh 

Sweet Caroline 
you said you'd be mine 
why did you lie to me baby 
Sweet Caroline

Where's all the humpin people at?
Where they at?
Say it loud, y'all

Humpin in the Key of One
