You can say what you will
But I know what you're trying to do
You go for the kill
To make me feel it's me, not you

I need inspiration
I can't stand your explanations
Why does it carry on this way
If you don't pay attention
I just want to mention
That I never wanna see you again

I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it
I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it

You can say what you will
But I know what you're trying to do
Now you go for the kill
To make me feel it's me, not you

But I need inspirations
I can't stand your explanations
Why do you carry on this way
If you don't pay attention
I just want to mention
That I never wanna see you again

I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it, yeah
I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it

You can say what you will
But I know what you're trying to do
Now you go for the kill
To make me feel it's me, not you
Yeah, yeah

But I need inspiration
I can't stand your explanations
Why do you carry on this way
If you don't pay attention
I just want to mention
That I never wanna see you again

I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it
I expect more of you than I do of myself
Now you've got to deal with it...
