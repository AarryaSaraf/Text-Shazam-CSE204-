Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper

Every time I call
My little freak on the phone
Either her line is busy
Or else she's not at home
So I call myself bein' real cool and slick
I got her cheaper
So I went way downtown
And got my little freak a little beeper

Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, shoo-be-do beeper

Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper

What's the beep?
Beep a freak!

Beep a freak!

Every time I call
My little freak on the phone
Either her line is busy
Or else she's not at home
So I call myself bein' real cool and slick
If I want her cheaper
I wonder what happened to my little freak
And her little beeper

Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper
(She's worse than Flipper!)
Call me on my beeper, on my beeper

Hello, nice to get you home
Where you been?
Oh, I've been on Sunset and Vine
Why do you think I brought you the beeper, freak?
It's cheaper to beep her, listen

Every time I call
My little freak on the phone
Either her line is busy
Or else she's not at home
So I call myself bein' real cool and slick
And get her a little cheaper, so, hey

And her beeper, I say...

Beep a freak!
What to do?
