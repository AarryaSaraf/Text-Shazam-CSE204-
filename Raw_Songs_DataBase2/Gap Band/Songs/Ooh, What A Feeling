I want you, I need you
Each and every day
But the feeling inside me
That just won't go away
I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

You kiss me and hold me
You make me fall in love
Satisfaction is something
You give me so much of
You are my night and day
I never felt this way

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, baby
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, baby, ooh-ooh...

I don't care what nobody say about you
I don't wanna feel surprised
All I know is when you come near me
It feels so nice

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

Hey, baby!

I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight
Tight, tight, hey
I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight

What a feeling
Oh, what a feeling
Oh, what a feeling
Oh, what a feeling...
