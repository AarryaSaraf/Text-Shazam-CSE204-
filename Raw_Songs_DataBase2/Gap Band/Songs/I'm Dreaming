Here I am in the middle of the night
I see myself with you
The question is: will it be alright?
Do you believe it's true?
And perhaps tonight, even in my sleep
We'll find a perfect bliss
Don't you wake me up
Please, don't wake me up
I'm captured by your pretty face
'Cause I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout the time that I spent with you

Trap in this vision of the past
It's hard to celebrate
Even though I know this dream won't last
And yet, I can't escape
In this fantasy right here in my dreams
I found the perfect place
For you to see in endless agony
We have no time to waste
'Cause I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming (dreaming)
I'm dreaming (dreaming, yeah)
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming. girl
I'm dreaming 'bout the time I can spend with you
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming, girl
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming (said I'm dreaming)
I'm dreaming (Dreaming about love, baby)
I'm dreaming 'bout the time-

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Dreaming 'bout tonight
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Please don't wake me up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Dreaming 'bout tonight
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Please don't wake me up

Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming (said I'm dreaming)
I'm dreaming (Dreaming 'bout the things, yeah)
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming (said I'm dreaming)
I'm dreaming (Dreaming 'bout the time)
I'm dreaming 'bout the time I could I spend with you
Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming (said I'm dreaming)
I'm dreaming (Dreaming 'bout the things)
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming 'bout the time I could I spend with you

Said I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do (Please)
