Stay with me
Forever won't you stay with me
I'll satisfy your fantasy
You and me, stay with me

Stay with me
Forever won't you stay with me
I'll satisfy your fantasy
You and me, stay with me

When I look and see you near
And your smile removes all fears
Just to hold you in my arms, ooh, baby
Keep me feeling safe and warm
Baby, please stay

Stay with me
Forever won't you stay with me
I'll satisfy your fantasy
(Ooh, baby)
Just you and me, stay with me, yeah

Stay with me
(Won't you stay)
Forever won't you stay with me
I'll satisfy your fantasy
You and me, stay with me, yeah

There's no use for you to cry
With you I'll be standing by
Just to hold you, oh, so near
Honey, wipe away all your tears
If you, baby, please stay

Stay with me
(Baby, stay)
Forever won't you stay with me
(Me, yeah)
I'll satisfy your fantasy
(Ooh, baby, baby)
You and me, stay with me, yeah

Stay with me
(Won't you stay with me)
Forever won't you stay with me
(Won't you stay with me)
I'll satisfy your fantasy
(Oh, baby)
You and me, stay with me, yeah
(Baby, stay)
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, baby

Stay with me
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Forever won't you stay with me
(Stay, stay)
I'll satisfy your fantasy
You and me, stay with me
