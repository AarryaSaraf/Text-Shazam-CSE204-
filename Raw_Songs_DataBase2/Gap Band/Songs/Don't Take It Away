Don't you take it, don't take it away
Don't you take it, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love

You decided that walking away
Was a thing for us to do
I don't know where to go, it's hard to say
Why don't you stay and see me through
How I need you here by my side
Why don't we both take a ride
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, yeah, don't take it away
Baby, we could have it all, don't you take it
Don't you take it, oh-oh, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love

Don't you take it, take it away
'Cause I've got a whole lot to say
Don't you know that I've been good to you
Why don't you stay and see me through
Don't you know I need you here by my side
Why don't we both take a ride
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Baby, we could have it all, don't you take it
Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love, yeah, yeah

Don't you take it, take it away
'Cause you know I've got a whole lot to say
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Yeah, don't you take it away
Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Yeah, whoa...
(Baby, don't take)

Take it, baby, ooh-ooh...
Said, I'm a lover, not a fighter
My love, you take me higher
Said I need you, baby

(Don't take it, don't take it away)
Did you hear me, baby, did you hear me, baby
Did you hear my, baby, did you hear me
Let me say it one more time
Said, I'm a lover, not a fighter
Your love would take me higher
Said I need you, baby

(Don't you take it, take it away)
Said I need you, I need you
I need you by my side, baby girl...
