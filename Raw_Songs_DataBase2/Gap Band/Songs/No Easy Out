Girl, you must be crazy
If you think I'm gonna let you go
Is your mind gettin' shaky?
And I just wanna let you know

I have found true love in you
A love that could see us through
And now I'm gonna show it
I just wanna let you know it
I'm never gonna let you go

I won't have us talkin'
This talk about you leaving me
If you're thinkin' about walkin'
Then baby that ain't pleasin' me

I have found true love in you
A love that could see us through
And now I'm gonna show it
I just wanna let you know it
I'm never gonna let you go

No easy out this time
Easy out
No easy out this time
Easy out

This just is conversation
Since I believe I've got the floor
Please don't break my concentration
Oh, by the way, I'm locking the door

I have found true love in you
A love that could see us through
And now I'm gonna show it
I just wanna let you know it
I'm never gonna let you go

No easy out this time
Easy out
No easy out this time
Easy out
No easy out this time
Easy out
No easy out this time
Easy out

Oh, no easy out this time
Easy out (never gonna let you go)
No easy out this time
Easy out (never gonna let you go)
No easy out this time
Easy out (never gonna let you go)
No easy out this time
Easy out (never gonna let you go)
No easy out this time (never, never)
Easy out (never, never)
No easy out this time
Easy out
