Snowballs rolling down the mountainside
The sun come around melting the snow away
Girl, I've been gone for such a long, long time
Season's no reasons to change

Girl, I love you more and more each day
And each and every day I pray that you will stay
Girl, I keep on loving you more and more each day
Season's no reasons to change

Oh, season's, season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change

Girl, I love you more and more each day
And each and every day I pray that you will stay

Oh, season's, season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change

If there's something special you like your days to bring
Something you been wishing for more than anything
Just be true and it will come to you
Season's no reason to change

Oh, season's, season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason to change
Season's no reason, season's no reason to change

Season's no reason to change
(Why you wanna change on me)
Season's no reason to change
(No, no-no, no-no-no, no)
Season's no reason to change
(Doesn't matter what, what the weather, girl)
Season's no reason to change
(Girl, I love ya, do you really love me)
Season's no reason to change
(No, no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no)
Season's no reason to change
(Why you wanna change on me)
Season's no reason to change
('Cause I'm the one that really, really, really loves you)
Season's no reason to change
