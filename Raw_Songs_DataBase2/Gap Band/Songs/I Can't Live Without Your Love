I just can't get used to
To the thought of being here
Without your love
I need your love
And I think I never will
'Cause the memory's still here
That we once knew
I'm missing you

'Cause in the heat of night
I dreamed of how we used to
Make things right, oh...
And I realized
That I need you here
Right by my side, whoa, yeah

'Cause I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
(Just can't do without your love)
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love

'Cause in the heat of night
I dreamed of how we used to
Make things right, yeah, whoa...
And I realized
That I need you here
Right by my side, oh...
Yeah

Oh, I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
I can't resist speaking 'bout your love
(Just can't do without your love)
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love

I can't live without your love
Just can't do without your love
Don't you know that I just can't live
Without your love, yeah

I can't without you, baby...
