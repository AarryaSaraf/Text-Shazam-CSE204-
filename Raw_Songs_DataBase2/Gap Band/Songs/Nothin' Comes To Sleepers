With the sunshine comes the dawning of a day
Still another dream has come then slipped away
Scattered visions of the things you want to be
Make you open up your mind and try to see
How to make dreams come true

Oh, life is but a dream
But nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Oh, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Sitting all alone you wonder what is real
Is it what you see or is it what you feel
While you're wondering the day has passed away
No more time for wondering it is time to pray
God, make our dreams come true

Oh, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Whoa, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

And God, make our dreams come true

Whoa, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Far beyond the sky the source of everything
Seems to hold within his hands your destiny
In the twinkling of an eye your life could change
Turn the sunshine in your life to tears of pain
And God made my dreams come true

Whoa, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream

Oh, life is but a dream, yeah
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
Whoa, life is but a dream
And nothin' comes to sleepers but a dream
But a dream
But a dream
