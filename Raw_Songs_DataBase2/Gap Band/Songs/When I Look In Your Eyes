There's things about me
That you never knew
How I go crazy each day
Wishing for you
I don't know your name
But I'd like to get over with you
'Cause I'm hot on your trail
You know that it's true

Because I like you
I hope you like me too
'Cause I've been waiting
A long, long time
Just to talk to you
You, you, you, you

When I look in your eyes
Something comes over me
Girl, I'm hypnotized
When I'm with you, can't you see
When I say that I'm glad to know you
The pleasure is mine
I've been wanting to meet you
For such a long, long time

Don't wanna say it in a letter
Don't wanna say it on the phone
I'll meet you at home
Where we can be alone

Because I like you
I hope you like me too
I've been waiting
Such a long, long time
Just to talk to you
You, you, you, you

Yeah, yeah, mm-hmm

When I look in your eyes
Something comes over me
Girl, I'm hypnotized
When I'm with you, can't you see
When I say that I'm glad to know you
The pleasure is mine
I've been wanting to meet you
For such a long, long time, hey-hey

When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive
When I look in your eyes
Everything is alive...

When I look in your eyes, whoo!
When I look in your eyes
Girl, you're gonna hypnotize, whoo!
Whoo!

When I look in your eyes
Whoo!
When I look in your eyes
Whoo!
When I look in your eyes...
