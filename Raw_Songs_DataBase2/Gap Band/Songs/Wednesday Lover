Every now and then, you may not know just when
You find a love that will treat you right
I'm so glad to say that one just came my way
It was on a very special night

Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover, there's no other
She's more than I ever would more than I got
More than I ever would need
There's no other
There's no other, there's no other love
And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me

On my worthy day
I'll dare never suppress the way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet she makes my life complete
I'll always want her by my side

Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover, there's no other
She's more than I ever would more than I got
More than I ever would need
There's no other
There's no other, there's no other love
And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me

It seemed that all the other days takes me much too far away
'Cause I'm longing for you, for you
Thursday Friday Saturday
I wish they all would go away
What am I to do?
Can I get back to you?
With all my heart, I'm yes
I dare never suppress
The way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet she makes my life complete
I'll always want her by my side

Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover
Wednesday lover, there's no other
She's more than I ever would more than I got
More than I ever would need
There's no other
There's no other, there's no other love
And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me
Wednesday lover

Wednesday lover, there's no other
She's more than I ever would more than I got
More than I ever would need
There's no other
There's no other, there's no other love
And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me

Let me here you say
Oh uh oh

Help me everybody here
Yeah ee ah
She's more than woman to me
More than I got
Everybody everybody help me sing
Oh uh oh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh yeah

She more than a woman to me
More, more
