We've had our share of trouble
Maybe more than others
With a little love and understanding
We can climb, climb many mountains
But as long as it's you and me, girl
There is nothing we can't do, oh

First night we kissed
I knew it was forever, oh oh oh
I can't believe that you'd ever think
Our love would ever end

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
Long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen
We can make it alright
Ooh, baby, listen to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Sometimes we listen to others
And that could be wrong
But we keep holding grudges
We let it go much too long
But as long as it's you and me, girl
There is nothing we can't do, oh

Come hold my hand
And say that you love me forever, oh oh oh
Then I will give you all that I have
Our love will never end

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
Just as long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen, yeah
We can make it alright
Ooh, baby, list to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
As long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen, listen yeah yea
We can make it alright
Baby, list to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
