I know the final chapter
Of our love has come
We tried to talk it out
Instead we only shout
And you know there's no avoiding
There's nowhere to run
So I will tell you now
Before you leave this time

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again

We were more than lovers
Much more than friends
But faith would test our strength
And little problems came right on in
But I know I want to try our love again
You say that you don't know
What I won't tell you before you go
We can be friends always

I'll always love you
No matter where you go, always
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go, always
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again
Yeah

In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go, always

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again
No, no

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
Baby, baby, baby
I'll always love you, oh...

I'll always love you
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I'll always love you...
