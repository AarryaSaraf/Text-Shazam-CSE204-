Girl, you know my weak spot
You know just what to do
Girl, give me your lovin'
Just the way I want

I'm singin' that 'cause I'm so in love
Like never before
Day by day, I can feel myself fallin'
In love with you more
Nothing else really matters, baby
As long as you're close to me
When you're doing the things you do
No one else can fill my need, yeah

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You always give me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

You're better for me, my love
Than all I've ever known
And now you're the holder of
The key that opens my heart
Till the end of time, I'll be there
Whenever you call my name
Never ever will I set you free
Only you can relight the flame, oh...

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You always give me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You're always givin' me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do, whoa...
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Oh, yeah, whoa...

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You're always givin' me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You're always givin' me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You're always givin' me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want...
