I don't know what to do
You're tellin' me that we're through
You've done that to me before
But you won't do it to me no more

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, leavin' me behind
Messin' with my mind
Wastin' time, all mine

You said you'd take me home, mmm...
So that we could be alone
But you told another lie
Girl, I don't know why

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, leavin' me behind
There you go, messin' with my mind
Wastin' time, yours and mine
No, no, no, no

Messin' with my mind, there you go

Wastin' time, all mine
But I knew before
But you won't do it to me no more, yeah

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)

There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, messin' with my mind...
