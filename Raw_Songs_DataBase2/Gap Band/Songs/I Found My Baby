I found my baby
I found my love
I found my honey
I found my girl

Baby, I just like to remember
The first time I set my eyes on you
Honey, a sight for sore eyes, remember
Forevermore I wanted you

That's why
I found my baby
I found my love
I found my honey
I found my girl

I found my baby
I found my love
I found my honey
I found my girl

Hey, girl, I think we're the right combination
A winning team, it must be for one
Let's try to keep this love together
It might bring out something real

That's why
I found my baby
(I found my baby and I think I'm all right)
I found my love
(I found my love and I feel all right)
I found my honey
('Cause I'm so satisfied)
I found my girl
(I think that I am falling in love)

I found my baby
I found my love
(I found my love)
I found my honey
(Honey, honey, honey)
I found my girl
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)
Whee!

Found my baby

Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Put a spark in my life
You put a spark in my life
You put a spark in my life
Put a spark in my life, baby
Oh, you're sweet as candy

I found my baby
(I found my girl)
I found my love
(Whoa, ooh...)
I found my honey
(Ooh, la, la, la-la-la)
I found my girl
(Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)

You put a spark in my life
You put a spark in my life
You put a spark in my life...
