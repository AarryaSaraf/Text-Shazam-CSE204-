Ooh why 
Oh why
Why does love hate?
Why do we segregate?
Can we consummate?
Why do we separate?
Love can conquer hate
My friend it's not too late
Why contemplate?
It's time to celebrate

Love conquers all
It's the missing thing
That everybody needs 
It's like a breath of spring
And if we love, love and make peace
Let all this hatred cease
Colour has no place in peace

Hear these words I say
My friend we're on our way
To a brighter day
Love will lead the way

The colour lines are gone
It's time to right our wrongs
Listen to this song
Those days have all darn gone

No colour lines 
No colour lines
Open up your eyes
Your hearts and your minds
Then we will find
We as people all are blind
We're running out of time
You'll see
We're all the same there's no colour lines
Nooo
Ohhh
No no no no no no no no
There are no colour lines
(There is no white or black, black or white, red yellow or brown)
No no no no no no no no no no

No colour lines
No colour lines
Open up your eyes
Your hearts and your minds
Then we will find we as people all are blind
We're running out of time
You'll see
Were all the same there is no colour lines
Were all the same there is no colour lines
Were all the same there is no colour lines

No colour lines
