Just got off a long hard road back at home again
remeniscing good ole times, the things that happened then

Standing in a summer breeze, whistling in the tall oak trees
no one here but the guys in me, the boys are back in town

Drifted into town one day, my how things had changed
skyscrapers and parking lots, boy its a shame
how music calls you to your fame, get out there and play it's game
come back home the whole town is strange
the boys are back again

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Strolling through a park that day, where a church had been
watching all the young kids play, make their spinning tops spin

happy youthful children sounds mocked a crazy carnival clown
a little boy kicking a ball around, glad we're back in town

Went on to the town square, a crowd was gather there
looking at the pretty girls, the fairest of the fair
The whole damn crowd began to cheer, many friends that we held so dear
made us glad that we were all here, glad we're back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

What the children need to see, is what the world really should be
no one knows but the guys and me, glad we're back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say na

What the children need to see, is what the world really should be
no knows but the guys and me, the boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na
