Let us say the words we feel
Wherein our hearts and our minds are still
The teachings of the masters in our past
They created special dreams
That included quiet streams
We're all of us together, we'll have to stand

And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
Someday we'll all be free
And then they say that
(We're together)
Someday we'll all be free

Once to you we say again
Let's walk together hand in hand
And take us to this place
Where the masters stood
Take us to the place with the quiet streams
We like to shake the hand
Of Dr. Martin Luther King
All of us together, all brotherhood

People, people, you best believe
That someday we'll all be free
You best believe that
Someday we'll all be free
You best believe that
Someday we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free

People, you best believe
(That someday we'll all be free)
That we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free

Play it, Stevie

Take us to the place of quiet streams
We like to shake the hand
Of Dr. Martin Luther King
All of us together
Together as one, as one

People, you best believe
That someday we'll all be free
Oh, people
That someday we'll all be free
You better believe
That someday we'll all be free
(People, all be free)
That someday we'll all be free
(Someday, people)
That someday we'll all be free

You better believe
That someday we'll all be free
People, freedom
That someday we'll all be free
(People)
That someday we'll all be free
(People, shakin' hands together)
That someday we'll all be free
(We're gonna be walking)
(And we're talking again)

Stand inside our pride
Shaking hands and talking
There'll be no more prejudices
We'll all be able to talk again
And walk again
In the land of free

That someday we'll all be free
You promised that someday
That someday we'll all be free
That someday we'll all be free
Yes, we will
All you gotta do is believe
That someday

Mm-hmm
Just you wait and see
We'll be able to walk and talk again
Thank you master
Someday we'll be able to walk side by side
Thank you, Jesus...
