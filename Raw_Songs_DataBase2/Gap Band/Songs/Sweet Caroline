Sweet Caroline 
Loved you with all of my heart 
Sweet Caroline 
don't want to ever part 
that wouldn't be very smart 
I need you for my wife 
time's too short in my life 

How I love you 

Sweet Caroline 
told me you believed in me 
Sweet Caroline 
all the time deceiving me 
telling me that you needed me 
can't see how you're leaving me 
don't know how to make you see 
that I love you 

Ooooooo Sweet Caroline 
Oh Sweet Caroline Oh Oh 

Sweet Caroline 
you said you'd be mine 
why did you lie to me baby 
Sweet Caroline
