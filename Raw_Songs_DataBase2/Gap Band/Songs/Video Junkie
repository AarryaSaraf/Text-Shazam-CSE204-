Every time I call her on the phone
A space invader's got my girl and gone

Video child, runnin' me wild
Girl, you're 'bout to blow my mind
The games you play is runnin' me away
Girl, you're 'bout to blow my mind
Early in the mornin' or late at night
Girl, the game you play is runnin' me away
Take the TV, but, girl, leave me
Girl, you're 'bout to blow my mind
