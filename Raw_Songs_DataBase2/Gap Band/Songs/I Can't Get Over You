I can't get over you
No matter what I do
Although you said that we were through
It's all about you

When I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord you'll come to me
Girl, I can't get over you
No matter what I do

Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you

Don't let it be for keeps
'Cause you mean that much to me
I can't get over you
No matter what I do

I can't get over you
No matter what I do
Although you said that we were through
It's all about you

Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you
Girl, I just can't get over you, yeah

I can't get over you, oh...
Girl, I can't get over you, baby
No matter what I do, whoa-whoa-whoa...
It's all about you, baby, baby
You said that we were through, oh...
It's all about you
It's all about you, baby
It's all about you, baby
All about you, baby, baby, baby...
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

When I hold you tight with all my might
Makes me feel real good inside
Oh, yeah, yes, I do, lady
We can't let it end like this
It's all about you, baby
It's all about you, baby, oh...

I can't get over you, oh...
Girl, I can't
Girl, I can't get over you, my love
No matter what I do, whoa-whoa-whoa
No matter what I do, my love
My lady, my baby
You said that we were through, oh...
'Cause you see
It's all about you
It's all about you, baby
It's all about you, baby
Yes, it is

Girl, I can't get over you
You said that we were through
What am I supposed to do
Without you, without you
Girl, it's all about you, you, yeah
