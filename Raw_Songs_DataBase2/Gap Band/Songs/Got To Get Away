'Cause I am tired of the past
Some of us are just used to existing

Got to get away from here

Headin' for the promised land
Maybe we can be together
Walkin' 'round and havin' so much fun, oh, yeah

Being as one with the sun

Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here
Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from

Maybe we can be together
Walkin' 'round and havin' so much fun, oh, yeah

Being as one with the sun

Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here
Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here

Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here
Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here

Gotta get away from here, oh, girl
Got to get away from here

Got to get away from here
