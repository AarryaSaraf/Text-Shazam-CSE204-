You just might be the one
I've been searchin' for
The way you make me feel
I've got to have some more
Girl, you're runnin', runnin'
Can't you see the light
You keep me runnin', runnin'
But you're never out of my sight

Oh, it's you, it's you that I'm livin' for
Gonna give you my love and more
Give you the key to my heart's door
Mm, the love that I'm feelin' tonight
Girl, I wanna hold you tight
I wouldn't give you the chance to run
Girl, don't you go

Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Whoa-whoa-whoa...)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't you go, please believe, baby)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
Don't leave me, don't ever go

I know you're into me
You told me so yourself
But you still run from me
You know you really care
I'm so lonely, lonely
Lonely as can be
I gave you money, money
Come on and set me free

Oh, it's you, it's you that I'm livin' for
Gonna give you my love and more
You're the key to my heart's door
Come on the love that I'm feelin' tonight
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
I wouldn't give you the chance to run
Don't you, don't you go, baby

Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't you go, don't you ever go)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Please, don't ever leave, baby)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't you ever go, whoa...)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't go, don't leave me, baby)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Please believe, baby)
(You've gotta look for your love)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(No, no, don't you ever go)

It's you that I'm livin' for
Gonna give you my love and more
Give you the key to my heart's door
Oh, you, the love that I'm feelin' tonight
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
I'm wouldn't give you the chance to run
Chance to run

Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't you ever try to go)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Please believe it, baby...)
