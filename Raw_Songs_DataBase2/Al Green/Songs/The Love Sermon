A grain of love is falling down
And time is there beside.
The carnival and the fair is always here,
Having fun on the rides.
Love is the dimension between time and feeling,
The distance from heaven to earth.
Well, that's my understanding
And I pray on, I pray on.

There's one thing I keep on looking for:
My someone to collect the grains of sand,
Cease the thought of times.
Something is on my mind
I'm standing,
I'm standing and I feel love's divineness:
My soul and heart and my mind,
I pray on.

Let me say - Little one, take my hand
Let us ask the Creator Man
Give us the wisdom to understand
What it feels to be a man
And say - I want to do everything for you
That ordinary men won't do
I want to climb the highest mountain
I think it's big enough for two.

Oh, come on...
If you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time, yeah.

You should count all your blessings, man.
Let known your feelings for all your friends:
They may be surprised when you say
There's love and the miraculous day.

Oh, my, my...
If you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time.

I want to make a donation this evening to
All the good things in our hearts and our minds
That we know that we ought to do.
I've got to strive for higher ground:
The Man who saves souls is coming down.

Oh, if you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time.

Hey, hey, everything I desire
Still I don't need you
I don't need you now.
I don't need you now.
Hey, stay with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
Hey, I can change your mind.
