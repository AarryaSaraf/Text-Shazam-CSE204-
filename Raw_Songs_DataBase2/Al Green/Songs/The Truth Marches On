The truth marches on
Of all the wrong I've done
Sometimes we stop, say hello
Too much has gone on and on and on

You know, the truth, he is not a young man
But he's old, of his time, he stays on your mind

The truth marches on and on and on
The truth marches on and on and on

Let the light shine on
Through the rain and the storm
Sometimes a day is nothing but wrong
But the light shines on, on and on and on
You know the truth, stopping to do what is right
Stay for the night

The truth marches on and on and on
The truth marches on and on and on

Gone in the day, shines at night
Another time you were right
Another smile on your face
I live for it, sweet every day

The truth marches on
The truth marches on
The truth marches on
Like a soldier
Like a soldier, yeah
The truth marches on
