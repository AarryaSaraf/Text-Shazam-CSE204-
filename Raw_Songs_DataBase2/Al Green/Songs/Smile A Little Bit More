Don't let it get you down, Lord

I smile and my heart disappears
Oh, smile and move your burning feet

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
Hey, we just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

A tear can bring such rapid pain, yeah
Our turn to see the winds change

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
All you gotta do just smile a little bit more, a little bit more

A friend of mine said, in my heart I see the winter
Making me a little older, but I, I don't mind

I just smile a little bit more a little bit more
He said that to me, I just smiled a little bit more, a little bit more

Told the band, play the song
Told the band, play the song

Ring the bell 'cause there's something to say
Happiness, you sure my simple things

So just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
All you've gotta do is just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
If your troubles get you down, you just smile a little bit more, a little bit more
