Angel, angel of fire
Coming down from heaven
You're my heart desire

See the smile on your face
Tryna cover up the dead face

Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Give your heart and saviourTryna make it to the other side
And maybe I too can see
The possibility of eternity
For me

Chariots of fire
Solomon in the cloud, Solomon
Chariots of fire
You better get right now

One more thing I say...

Chariots of fire
Solomon in the cloud
Chariots of fire
Better get right now

One more thing I say...

Treat your neighbour
As you treat yourself
Give your heart to the saviour
And to no one else

See the mountain skipping
See the sand slipping
Aside

Chariots, chariots of fire
Chariots of fire
Chariots of fire
My lord
Chariots of fire
Lord
