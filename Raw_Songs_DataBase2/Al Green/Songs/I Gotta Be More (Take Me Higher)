Gotta be more than a cigarette smoker, practical joker, more
Just super fly, tryna be high, more
They understand a better man, more
Than a demonstrator, obligator, take me higher

Up to the sky make me cry take me higher
Where the birds don't fly take me higher
Up to the sky, higher

One thing odd it seems I've been a bad boy
I don't know just where to turn
Can't turn you soul burn won't you take me higher

Up to the sky where the birds fly take me higher
I want to see the golden city higher
Come on roll with me take me higher

Gotta be more (higher)
Than a friendly brother without the other more (higher)
Than your pride that's inside be more (higher)
Than friends do you in be more (higher)
Than the righteous one up to take me higher

Up to the sky make me cry take me higher
...higher
Up to the sky make me cry higher
