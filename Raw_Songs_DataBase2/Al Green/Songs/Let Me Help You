Girl, if you knew I've come to help you
We're in love so let me help you, girl
Do I make dreams come true
Do without just to comfort you
Do I do anything
Anything just to ease the pain

I can be true, so let me help you, girl
Don't turn me down, let me help you, girl

You're at home feeling sad and blue
Dry your eyes, let me comfort you
Bring to you lots of love
I've got love, baby, I've got love

Dreams can come true, just let me help you
We're in love, let me help you, girl
I got to help you, baby
Give you all my lovin' now baby
