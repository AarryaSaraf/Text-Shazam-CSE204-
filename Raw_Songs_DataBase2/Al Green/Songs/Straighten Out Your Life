Oh Satan will make you do the wrong thing
Straighten out Your life in Jesus Name
You that you will do the real thing
When you put your life in Jesus Name

No life is wasted when you were reborn
And it don't really matter what you've done
Don't be discouraged don't be ashamed

Straighten out your life
Straighten your your life... that's the one
Straighten out your life in Jesus Name

Oh, No life is wasted when your reborn
And it don't really matter what you've done
Don't be discouraged don't be ashamed

Straighten out your life

Straighten out your life in Jesus Name

Ah you see it clear, You feel the change
(Straighten out Your Life in Jesus Name)
Ah you see it clear, You feel the change
(Straighten out your life in Jesus Name)
Ah you feel the difference, you see the change

Straighten out your life

Straighten out your life
