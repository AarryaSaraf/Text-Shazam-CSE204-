When your problem seems
More than you can bear
You just call on him
And he'll be right there
Hold onto God's hand
Doing the best you can
With happiness that leads
To the promised land
They can't bring you down
From this higher ground
Well happiness it leads
To safe, sound, found
I cried many tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears

Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall

I feel so good
Won't you clap your hands

Father bless the one
For try and make me cry
Cause the hallowed peace are theirs
Wed deep down inside
They can't bring you down
From your higher ground
Well happiness that leads
To your safe, sound, and saved
I cried some tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears
Oh God almighty
Send a helping hand
See I'm trying to do
Do the best I can
If you let me I will
Climb the highest hill
While I sing this song
That gives my heart a chill
I'm gonna fight on
For the life on high

Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
