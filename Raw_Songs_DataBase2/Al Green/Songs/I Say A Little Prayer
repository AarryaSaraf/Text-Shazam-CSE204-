Each mornin' I wake up
Before you put on your make-up
I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you
Each day I just take time
All through your coffee-break time
I say a little prayer for you
Oh I say a little prayer for you
Let me tell you now

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

I run for the bus, dear
While I'm ridin' I think of us
And I say a little prayer for you
I say a little prayer for you
Oh love, believe me
There is no one but you
Please love me too
Oh I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

Forever, forever
You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever, forever
We never will part
And how I love you...
