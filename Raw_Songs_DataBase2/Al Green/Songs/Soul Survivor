To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

I never doubt for a minute
The power of the word
Or the messages in it
But Jesus had to live everyday
In a blessed righteous way

So I'm taking out a policy
Gonna get some soul insurance
Jesus is my benefactor
Leaving my spiritual state
To the one I pledge my fate

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

Worldly wants won't permit it
Only suffering from a life of sin
Why don't you let go and let God?
Give you what you're searching for

He'd give you all the love
You've been missing
Save you from disaster
Just open up your heart
And let him in today
Cause it's your soul that he's after

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity

In my Father's house there are many men
Every one a soul I've been told
I'm going away to prepare a place for you
And where I am there ye maybe also

To be a soul survivor
Heading for the place
That he promised to me
A soul survivor
And everlasting love for eternity
