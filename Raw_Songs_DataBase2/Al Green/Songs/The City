I see the lights of the city
Great big city
Wonderful city
And the people standing all around
Standing on the ground
And making sounds
I've been waiting for so long
I've gotta stop searching
My whole life will be gone
All my life

I'm gonna take my time and way
To the great big city oh
The wonderful city
Some people say that love ain't fair
Don't give a care
Go around and swear
I might as well not be there
My heart is in despair
It just isn't fair
I'm feeling well I've come from so far
Gonna get out from, from my car

I've gotta make some sound
That'll raise the walls
Of that great big city
I wanna go to that beautiful city
The city, city

I better stay just here go now
Riding in my car
Looking at a star
Won't you try to open up now
Look what's in there
Don't you think it's fair
I, I ain't playing by the walls
I've got it people down there
Hey, I've gotta make sure
Of that great big city
I wanna go to the wonderful
Beautiful, wonderful city
Yeah, I wanna go, I wanna go
Don't you wanna go now
