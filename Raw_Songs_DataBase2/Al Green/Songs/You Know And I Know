You know and I know
I love you in a special way
And when you call me
I met you first to be my friend

Life without your love is no good at all
So I'm glad you're here to hear my call
With you by my side I'll never fall
At all, at all

You say I never pay
No attention to the things you say
And I can't understand
Why you answer every time I pray?
Cause without your love
So what can I say?
Need you more and more everyday
Talk to you and I try to explain
Explain it all

You know and I know
All about you everything you say
And without you nothing comes my way
I can't live without you not a single day

You know and I know
Your every smile
Your every frown
I try to do my best
But it's not good enough
And I'm back on the ground

Sometimes I think about my faults
I think about giving up but then
I can't think that at all cause
I can't live without your love not a single day
At all

You know and I know
I love you, I love you
You know and I know
I love you, I love you
