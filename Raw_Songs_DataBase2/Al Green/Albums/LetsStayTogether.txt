Let's stay together

'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why, somebody, why people break-up
Oh, turn around and make-up

You'd never do that to me
Would you, baby?
Just being around you is all I see

Here's what I want us to do

Let's, we ought to stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Come on

Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Open your eyes, can't you see

So you're leavin' me

That I can make you stay

They'll lie on you and me

// I've Never Found A Girl (Who Loves Me Like You Do) //

Ain't no love (baby) like my baby's love
It's like burnin' fire, shut up in my bones
(I got to say it)
Ain't no lonely days
Ain't no lonely nights
Every thing that she does
You know the girl's alright

(I got to say it)
I ain't never, never found me a girl
(I wouldn't lie about it, baby)
Never, never found me a girl
(To squeeze me tight at night)
Never, never found me a girl
Nobody to love me like you do
(I ain't lying about it, baby)
Love me like you do

(Sweet baby)
Ain't no man got a sweet woman like me
She's everything in the world
One man could claim
She's every poor boy's dream
(Let me say that)
She's every very rich man's prayer
I don't need no money, honey
Because (you know) she's always there

Never, never found me a girl
(Somebody to keep me walking in my shoes)
Never, never found me a girl
(She always brings me good news)
Never, never found me a girl
To love me like you do
Love me like you do (baby)

Never, never found me a girl
(And here I stand with tears in my eyes)
Never, never found me a girl
(And I'm caught by total surprise)
Never, never found me a girl
To love me like you do
(Oh, sweet baby)
Love me like you do (baby)

You do
(I ain't never found a girl)
You do
(You squeeze me tight, love me right)
You do
(Got me walking in my shoes)
You do
(Make me feel good)

// How Can You Mend A Broken Heart? //

I can think of younger days when to live for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow 

How can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down? (tell me)
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

How can you mend this broken man? (yeah)
How can a loser ever win? 
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow 
Would you believe that no one
No one ever told us about the sorrow (so)

How can you mend a broken heart? (and mine is)
How can you stop the rain from falling down? (baby)
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go round? (and sometime I have to say, yeah)

(Tell me)
Help me mend my  broken heart 
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna live again, baby

How can you mend this broken man? (yeah, somebody tell me)
How can a loser ever win? (baby)
Help me mend my... This old broken heart 
I think I, I believe I
I feel like I got to, I feel like I wanna live again

How can you mend this broken heart? (somebody please tell me)
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
(I wanna know. I know my my clothes are all wet, tell me) 
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I've got a feeling that I want to live and live and live

// Judy //

I never thought dreams could happen,
Until one came true for me.
Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
My life has been one sweet melody.
Yeah! Yeah!
I never thought I could welcome....
Two other hearts as I do.

Oh...Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
Well it's been a real hip thing I'm telling you.
Oh, saying that I want Judy.
Talking about beauty,
She's got it.
I know she's got it.
Her sweet little ways,
Mean so much to me.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

I'm making mine Judy.
To love her! Got her! Got her! Yeah! Yeah!
Gonna keep her right here with me.
Yeah! Oh yeah!
Now I find it hard to believe, that I'm happy.
All my pains and heartaches are all gone.
So glad I can tell the world:
Since I met Judy,
Since I met Judy,
Well my life has been one sweet song.
I won't be worried long.
If you think I'm gonna leave her,
Man, you're wrong.

It's only Judy.
I'm telling you you're wrong.
I love Judy.
I'm crazy about that Judy.
Judy, Judy, Judy!

// It Ain't No Fun To Me //

Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain
Standing by the highway
Just waiting in the rain

October sun is shining
These tears they cause me pain
Oh, it simply make up
Only just to break up, oh baby

And that ain't no fun to me
I said it ain't no fun to me
Leaving you, it sure ain't no fun to me, babe
I said leaving, sure ain't no fun to me, baby

I believe in you
And I would like what you to do me
Baby, oh you make me feel like a brand new man
Oh, baby, another thing I'd like to say

I'll take the love and affection
Wherever I can, baby
Now that's no fun to me, let me see it
That's no fun to me, baby

You got me standing here waiting
You got me standing here waiting
I really, really, I don't mind waiting
If I told you it ain't no fun to me
I want you to know, it ain't no fun to me, baby

'Cause sometimes I have to sit down
I think about it
Just sit down, think about it
It ain't no fun to me, baby

Sometimes I feel like leaving you, baby
I don't mind leaving you, baby
But it ain't no fun to me, no, no, no
But it ain't no fun to me
