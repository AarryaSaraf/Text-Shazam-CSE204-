Album: AlGreenGetsNextToYou

// I Can't Get Next To You //

I.. (my my my my)
I can turn a gray sky blue (you see) 
I can make it rain when I want it to 
I can build a castle from a single grain of sand (you see) 
I can make a ship sail on dry land (children, yeah) 

Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess 
Girl, you're the key to my happiness 
And I...

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Oh Lord
(Can't get next to you) 
I've been trying a long time 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
(Can't get next to you)
I don't know what to do 

(Let me say) 
I.. (my my my my my)
I can fly like the bird in the sky 
I can buy anything that money can buy 
I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unhappy am I with all the powers that I possess 
Girl, you're the key, 'cause

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Baby
(Can't get next to you) 
I've been trying a long time 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
(Can't get next to you)

(Let me tell you that) 
I can turn back the hands of time 
(You better believe I can... you see)
I can make the seasons change 
Just by waving my hand (let me say) 
I can change anything from old to new (girl)
All the things I want to do the most (you see)
I'm unable to do 

Unimportant are all these things
That I'm trying to do here today day
Girl, you see, I...

(Can't get next to you, babe) 
I've been trying a long time
(Can't get next to you) 
Somebody oughta help me 
(Can't get next to you, babe) 
Let me, let me go
(Can't get next to you)
Let me!

Lord, I've been working on it, baby 
I've been thinking about it
You see, I've been trying to call you all day long
But, you see, I don't have your phone number, honey 
I've been thinking about you baby, something awful 
Sometime I feel like I want to moan about it 
And I just don't know what to say 
And I say..

// Are You Lonely For Me, Baby? //

Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

Oh, it's our last train, baby, to Jacksonville
I'm gonna get on it, baby, you know I will
Will you try? Go ahead and try
To forget all the pain I brought you

Go on and try, go ahead and try, baby
I know I'm the one who taught you

Yeah, but I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely and blue
Good god, I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you, all alone

Yeah, I'm lonely
Let me, let me say that I'm lonely, baby
Lord, have mercy rain now

It's our last bus to Jacksonville
My sweet baby, are you still?
Tell your friend, it's the end
I will never, never again desert you

He will laugh
I can hear him laughing, baby
And you'd said that I was wrong to hurt you
Oh, but I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry about that, baby

I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you

Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

Are you lonely for me, baby?
Are you lonely for me, baby?

It's a long ride to Jacksonville
Nobody will ever know the way I feel
Will you be there, will you be there, baby?
When I step down from the train

Will you be there, baby?
You just you got to be there, baby
When it's somebody call my name

Yeah, I'm lonely, baby
I'm lonely and blue
Oh Lord, I'm lonely, baby
And I'm lonely for you

Let me, let me tell you that I'm lonely, baby
I want to [?] all night long

Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?
Are you lonely for me baby?

// Tired Of Being Alone //

I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can?

People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me
Hey baby, you didn't go for that
It's a natural fact
That I wanna come back
Show me where it's at, baby

I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Soon as you can

I guess you know that I, uh, I love you so
Even though you don't want me no more
Hey hey hey hey, I'm cryin' tears
All through the years
I'll tell ya like it is
Honey, love me if you will

Yeah baby
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby
Sometime I wonder

If you love me like you say you do
You see baby, I-I-I been thinkin' about it, yeah

Ya see, sometimes I hold my arms, I say mmmm hmmm hmmm
Yeah baby
Meeting you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream, yeah

Tired, baby
Yeah, you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby
Oh baby, baby
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
