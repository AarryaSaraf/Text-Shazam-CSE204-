// Love Is A Beautiful Thing //

This is what I believe..

Been so long since I met you
And all the changes we've been through
And all this time I can't forget you
Everywhere I turn I think of you
And I..I wanna love ya baby
And you-ooh, you are all I need

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Maybe it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

Love is such a sweet emotion
I want to share it all with you
Your trust and..endless devotion
There ain't nothing in this world we can't do
Tonight..I want to thank, thank you baby
And you make my life complete

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Maybe it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

...Somebody raise your hand now (beautiful, beautiful)
...Ooooooooh I know I know I know (beautiful, beautiful)

And I, I wanna touch you baby
And you, you're all I need

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Love is a beautiful thing
One to one, you and me
Oh I know it's our destiny
Cos love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful

Stay together through thick and thin
Now I know I've got a friend
Cos love is a beautiful thing
Face our fears all through the years
Now I know there are no more tears
Loves is a beautiful thing

Soul to soul, fire to fire
Nothing's like this man's desire
Cos love is a beautiful thing

Ohhhhhh, you and me
Oh I know it's our destiny
Love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful thing, it's a beautiful thing
Love is a beautiful thing
Yeahhhhh
Ohhh ohhhh
Love is a beautiful thing
It's so beautiful, beautiful
You're so beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful
Let's stay together
Cos I'm still in love with you
Hold me, hold me for the good times
I'm tired of being alone
Here I am
Beautiful, beautiful, it's a beautiful thing
Don't let nobody change your mind
It's a beautiful thing

// Give It Everything //

Love,
What about the things you want?
What about the things you need,
Versus the things you don't have?
You should have,
All of this world's desires,
All of this world's entire
Bounty and beautiful love

[Chorus:]
The stars and the moon
And the birds soar real soon
You should have
All the things that you need
Give it everything
All the world to bring
If you believe in something
You go to give it everything

Love
There's no time to waste
There's no life to take
Believers don't have to make haste
Oh no, but "I love you"
Are more than just some sweet words
"I love you"
Are the sweetest words I ever heard
One thing about I can't explain
That you are the world to me
When you're sure you love me
Show you love tenderly

[Chorus]

Why should settle for second best
When you haven't tasted all the rest
Listen to me
Listen to my request
You should have all the things you want,
the things you need
All of the things your mind can conceive

[Chorus]

// Fountain Of Love //

As the world turns slowly
You're always on my mind
As a friend you're always there for me
Forever by my side
I hear you whisper my name
I can never feel alone
I says deep down in my heart
I don't want us to part
And I want to take you home

Oh, just take my hand
Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That your love flows from the fountain of love, 
Love, love

Let love surround us
And this feeling of the night, yeah
If there is a doubt in your mind
I will make it alright, hmmm
I've never felt like this before
It's only you that I adore
I says deep down in my heart
I don't want us to part
And I want to take you home

Oh, just take my hand

Come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love, 
Love, love

Oh I know, I know
As the world turns slowly
You're always on my mind
As a friend you're always there for me
Forever by my side

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love flows from this fountain of love

If you want the answer now, now , now
Let's drink together from the fountain of love
Oh baby, won't you look in my eyes and realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love

Take my hand, come and walk with me
Let us drink together from the fountain of love
Why don't you look in to my eyes and you'll realise
That true love, true love, true love, flows from the fountain of love
Take my hand come on and walk with me
If you look into my eyes then you will realise
That true love flows from the fountain of love

// Don't Look Back //

If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
We're gonna walk and don't look back. 
Don't look back
And don't look back
And don't look back, baby. 
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.
Keep on walking and don't look back
The places behind you let them re-remind you.

Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl.
Keep on walking and won't look back.
Forget about the past now, baby.
And don't look back.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back.
