// I Can Feel It //

I was just a little boy
Why, my momma said to me
Son, you want to grow up strong
You gotta know what you believe
You're gonna find out one day
There's only two ways you can go
And when you get down
To the end of the line
There's somebody you need to know
She was telling me all about Jesus
And how He died to set me free
He arose from the dead
For a Memphis boy like me

I can feel it
From the sole of my feet
To the crown of my head
I felt it from the day I was born
I know my God ain't dead
He wakes me up early in the morning
And keeps me late at night
Choose to run away from the darkness
And start to walk in the light

He's the Alpha and Omega
He's the beginning and the end
He's the only one of the people
That I can really
Really call a friend
He's the first and the last
Ah you know the Word is true
If you want anything from my Lord
You know what you've got to do

She was telling me all about Jesus
And how He died to set me free
He arose from the dead
For a Memphis boy like me

I can feel if from the crown of my head
To the sole of my feet
How He threw up both of His hands
For the people that believe

It wasn't done in a corner
But high up on a hill
You gotta give it all you've got
People you know the deal

I can feel it from the crown of my head
To the sole of my feet
I have felt it from the day I was born
I know my God ain't dead
He wakes me up early in the morning
And keeps me late at night

// Love Is Reality //

Won't you stop the violence
In the street
He can make the pain go away
He can make the mood change
That's happening every day
People on people crime
Will never slightly change a thing
It's all a state of mind
The situation's got to change

[Chorus:]
Oh, I know that Your love is real
I can feel the light shining bright
If you want a better deal
Let the people sleep at night
Love is reality
Love is
Love is reality

What about the time
When you were living out on the street
The homeless people everywhere
With not enough food to eat
People on people crime
People all hurt the same
There's peace and deliverance
If you call on Jesus' name

This is something
That I should know
I've been down here before
You can try and try another way
But you're standing right at the door

[Chorus]

// Just Can't Let You Go //

Love me
I want you back
I need you more than you think
I can't let you go
Hold me
I'm down to 1-2-3
Two and two is four
I can't let you go

Times spent together
All is dear to me
So you know my mind
All I need is Spring to see
Hold on tight
Can't let you go
Hold on tight
I just can't let you walk out on me

You don't know, know me
Stay around and see
I just can't let you go

Soon there'll be
Someone just for me
I'll be glad
When it comes down
To no one but you and me
I'll be glad when it comes down
To nobody but you and me

Hold on, got to hold on
Just can't let you go
Hold on
I just can't let you go
Hold on, got to hold on
I just can't let you go

// You Don't Know Me //

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

I may look the same
Carry the same old name
But a change has come
To make me someone new
I may look the part
But it wasn't from my heart
Quit livin' that lie
When I met Jesus face to face

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

I may wear the same old clothes
Lookin' like I haven't been told
I can see Jesus Christ
Right through this veil of tears
You don't know my heart
I'm talkin' about the sacred part
It gets a little better
And better and better
All through the years

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

This thing started a long time ago
I'm talkin' back in the Bible days
People thinking they know you
And living a live
And dealing in contrary ways
Don't let it stop your stuff
You gotta be tough
These things will soon come to pass

Keep your head in the sky
You can get by
And come out the victor at last

You don't know me
You don't understand
You don't know me
Just what kind of man
If you love me
Just take my hand
I will help you to understand

// Again //

Well, I'm trying Lord, to be full of Your conviction
Sometime temptation has its way
Will You hear my prayer, You don't owe me nothing
I need to feel You again and again, I hear You stray, yeah

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

Sometimes I stumble Lord and sometimes I fall
But all my questions Lord, You hear them all
Another day with You by my side
I have nothing to hide from You, You help me through

Come on, my

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

Oh, hey Lord, only want Your deliverance
Only time will tell it well
You make me feel, You make me

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

When you think you stray too far
And you're afraid to ask once more
Remember child that you are mine
I'll hear your prayer and take you back again

// Positive Attitude //

This song if for the people
Those that live in doubt
You won't have to scream
You won't have to shout
We've heard it over
Time and time again
There's someone I want you to meet
He is my best friend

He will bless the right
And condemn the wrong
Come my sisters and brothers
And sing this song

[Chorus:]
I've got a message for you
Gotta have a positive attitude
Nothing my God can not do
When we have a positive attitude

The time is now
To reach all the people
Now what I'll do
Is keep my mind on You
Blessed assurance
Jesus is mine
Look beyond my faults
Just one more time
Please Lord, forgive me
Try me one more time
Your truth and devotion
I can't deny

[Chorus]

Come on
Can you play the solo
So come on people
Give your faith a try
He will never let you down
No His love you can't deny
We have such a blessing
In this opportunity
Of going to our Father
For our joy and assurance
Blessed assurance
Jesus is mine
Want you to forgive me
Just one more time

[Chorus]

// Sure Feels Good //

Over here, over there
People are waiting
On the wings of a prayer
Their hopes are fading
Well I know He can be
Everything for You
Gotta say what I feel
And you know it sure feels good
To know that He is there for me

I know that He loves me
I know that He saved me
It sure feels good
I gotta peace of mind
That you can't deny
When He turned my life around
Oh I can promise
It ain't no lie
He sent me here just to testify
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels good

Another day, another way
People are dying
But I know there are those
That can stop this crying
You can say what you will
I won't stop moving
Tell me this, tell me that
Don't plan on losing
'Cause this thing sure feels good

Tell you He loves me
Oh that He moves me
Sure feels good
I gotta love that's divine
That you can't find
Unless your hand is wrapped up in mine
Oh I got a feeling each and every day
This walk gets only sweeter
Day by day
Oh how He saved me
It sure feels mighty good
Haven't you heard
Don't you know, don't you know
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute
Won't you stop a while
There may be something here
That can make you smile
If it feels good
The way it's supposed to feel
Then you should know
That this love is real
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good
Got a peace of mind
That I can't deny
Turned my life around
I can promise, it ain't no lie
He sent me here
Just to testify
Oh how He loves me
It sure feels good

// A Long Time //

A long time has come and gone
I've seen more than I should
You know I've seen it all
There's never been lack
For the marks on my back
Said a long time has come and gone
My hope is God for tomorrow
No more tears
Say goodbye to sorrow
In the middle of the desert
Said He would spring forth a well
My hope is in God for tomorrow

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Once I was lost
But now I'm found
God shed His grace on me

I don't want to cry no more
I pour out my heart
Now I'm walking out the door
I don't want to cry no more

Somebody's got to help me please
For more than twenty years
My eyes been filled with tears
A long time has come and gone
You don't know me well
There are surprises that I keep
I could never tell
You'll never know
A long time has come and gone
Seen more than I should
You know, I've seen it all
Never been lack for the marks on my back
A long time has come and gone

// Why //

Tell me why
Why can't I hear your answer
Why do I feel so all alone
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into Your own
My God, the place I belong

I'm dedicated now
To the place I love
Nothing can hold me back
From the place of heaven above
The question to all these things is

Tell me why, why
How come I feel so
Why don't the moon beam go
Where the sun beam go
Tell me why
I'm a believer
Bring me back into your own
The place where I belong

If you start to try to separate
The light from the darkness
Only my God will know
We shouldn't judge
We should walk our walk
And talk our talk
Nobody knows what God knows

I want to know the answers
To all of these questions
Tell me why, why

// I Like It //

Going to Paradise
No looking back
No time for thinking twice
Nothing do I lack
See I like it, I like it

There's nothing you can change
No substitute
Jesus is the one and only absolute
You see I like it, I like it

I finally found a love
And it's for real
I gotta let you know
I like it, I like it

Hey America
I want to tell the world about it
Hey America
Shout it from the mountains
Don't doubt it

You can turn a smile
And think I'm wild
Keep your own mind
Keep your own style
I like it, I like it
I finally found a love
That's for real
Gotta let you know
I like it, I like it
