// Belle //

Belle...
The Lord and I have been friends for a mighty long time
Belle...
Leaving him has never ever really crossed my mind
Let me say just one thing...
I'd never go so far
cause it's Him no matter who you are
Belle...
oh it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need
(I'd like to take a minute) just to say now...
Belle...
Belle...
the laughter of the sound has quieted down
Belle...
The best thing we could do is have Him around
Let me say this one thing...
I think if love could've found
my heart was lost but now it's found
Belle...
Let's you and I let the love come down
I'm so happy... let me say this...
It seems so easy to me
I've tried to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time
Belle...
Lord, He's my surprisin', my pride and my joy,
Belle...
I know that you can understand
This little country boy
(I'm just a country boy)
Belle...

He brought me safe thus far...
(Let me say this to you lady...)
through many drunken country bars

Oh, let me say,
He's my bright morning star
Belle..
He's my bright morning...
My everything...
Belle...
Belle...

Belle...
I know you're all of these things girl
ya, but He's such a brighter joy...
He's! He's! He's!
Jesus is my!
My everything!
My everything!
In the morning (time)
In the evening (time)
In the daytime
In the nighttime...

He's my everything, yeah!
Belle...
Belle..

// Loving You //

What a beautiful morning
A happy morning, morning, you see
Where the Lord has blessed each one
Each one, even you and me
I thank the Lord for his goodness
For he's been my friend
I thank the Lord for the children
Now we can walk on in

Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Well, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Loving you
Keep on loving you

On more thing...

What a beautiful day
The Lord has whispered something in my ear
Well, it's nothing sad
But it's something never ever brings a tear
I thank the Lord for my time
He gave unto my friend
Now I think it's time that we get together
And walk on in

I'm trying to be good like my Jesus
See, I'm trying to be good like my Jesus
Trying to be good like my Jesus
Loving you
I can't stop loving you

Trying to get to Heaven that way
See, I'm trying to get to Heaven that way
Trying to get to Heaven that way
Loving you
I'm gonna keep on loving you

See, I cried when I wouldn't
I wouldn't take nothing for the man
There are other times when I don't
I don't really think I can

(Trying to get to Heaven that way)
But He's been so good
(Trying to get to Heaven that way)
But He's been so good
Loving you
Keep on loving
Let me keep loving
Keep on loving
Keep on giving
Keep on singing
Keep loving you
I won't stop
Even got me feeling like...
Loving you
I can't stop loving you
Let me keep loving you
Keep on loving
Loving you

// Feels Like Summer //

A happy song in the days
What are we after?
I can hear mister say
Someone will call
Someone will call
Someone will call

Ooh

Oh happy song today
In time, I can hear mister say
Snow will fall
Snow will fall, yea
Yea, the snow will fall

Snow, snow, snow, snow, will fall
Snow, snow, beautiful snow
Wonderful, cold snow
Snow

Wonderful snow, snow

Beautiful clean wonderful snow

// Georgia Boy //

[Spoken:]
Don't make no difference to you
Well, it's all right with me

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking 'bout Georgia too

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing
I'm gonna find it out
Without the slightest doubt

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking of Georgia too

Just 'cause I talk the way I do
Don't mean that it ain't true
'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too

Here me see it again now

'Cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about...
That's right!

In the meantime

So it seems I dream
It's just a passing thing

I'll play my guitar
Feels so good!
Just a country boy, yeah

Just because I'm from the country
I've been a miner too
(You better believe)
Just because I'm thinking about New York City
Just 'cause I am it don't mean
I ain't thinking about Georgia too

Meanwhile, meanwhile
I'll play my guitar here

South's gonna do it again

// All 'N All //

When your problem seems
More than you can bear
You just call on him
And he'll be right there
Hold onto God's hand
Doing the best you can
With happiness that leads
To the promised land
They can't bring you down
From this higher ground
Well happiness it leads
To safe, sound, found
I cried many tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears

Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall

I feel so good
Won't you clap your hands

Father bless the one
For try and make me cry
Cause the hallowed peace are theirs
Wed deep down inside
They can't bring you down
From your higher ground
Well happiness that leads
To your safe, sound, and saved
I cried some tears
Through years and years and years
If you just stand still
He'll fight your fears
Oh God almighty
Send a helping hand
See I'm trying to do
Do the best I can
If you let me I will
Climb the highest hill
While I sing this song
That gives my heart a chill
I'm gonna fight on
For the life on high

Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall
Jesus is my all
He's my all 'n all
He will hear my call
And never ever let me fall

// Chariots Of Fire //

Angel, angel of fire
Coming down from heaven
You're my heart desire

See the smile on your face
Tryna cover up the dead face

Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Give your heart and saviourTryna make it to the other side
And maybe I too can see
The possibility of eternity
For me

Chariots of fire
Solomon in the cloud, Solomon
Chariots of fire
You better get right now

One more thing I say...

Chariots of fire
Solomon in the cloud
Chariots of fire
Better get right now

One more thing I say...

Treat your neighbour
As you treat yourself
Give your heart to the saviour
And to no one else

See the mountain skipping
See the sand slipping
Aside

Chariots, chariots of fire
Chariots of fire
Chariots of fire
My lord
Chariots of fire
Lord

// Dream //

Dream that there will come a day
Dream that the Lord will make her wake
Dream, dream, dream

Wake up early and..

Dream the stars down from the sky
Dream without knowing the reason why
Just dream, just dream, oh dream

What I wanna do is..
Make it last forever
Make it last forever
Make it, make it, make it, make it

(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)

Let me say this one thing..

Dream I'm the one that you know
Dream a new and different stroke
Just dream... dream
(We can make it all come true)
I wanna know, I wanna... Take me with you

(Make it last forever)
Make it last forever
Take me along with you
While you make it last forever
In a dream, you can make it...
Oh, I wanna go with you
Make it last forever
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna...

(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)
Everybody likes to...
Everybody wants to dream sometime

Dream... shh!... dream...
Shh!... dream
(We can make it all come true)
Dream. Shh!... Wontcha dream?
The stars are shining bright
Dream
Let your mind and you heart
Just melt, melt melt like ice
Dream
(Dream... Just dream
We can make it all come true)

Dream. Don't take it, Lord 
Just dream
(We can make it all come true)
