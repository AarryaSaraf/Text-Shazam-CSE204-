// I Can't Stop //

I can't stop
I just can't stop loving you
I can't stop my hands from holding you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
You and me, you and me

I can't stop
I just can't stop holding you
And I can't quit a love like this from consuming you
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no, no
Me loving you, you loving me
Your love is more than I deserve
Oh baby, you made me, you gave me your love...

I just can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you
You keep me hanging on
Whatever I do
There must be a reason why I feel so free
No, I can't stop, no, no, no
I just can't stop

// Play To Win //

Hey baby, it's you again
If you're gonna play, you've got to play to win
Hey baby, the time is right
Only tonight he's out of sight

I know it's you, for what I know
Tell all the guys, it's time to go
Your love is all I need
For ever and ever is what I seek

Oh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

I can't share your love alone
If not tonight, oh baby, then I'm gone
Whatever you say, I know you're right
Only tonight, only tonight

Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

I know just what I'm sayin'
I ain't lyin' and I ain't playin'
Only the love is what I need
You can see whatever you wanna see

And I can't share your love alone
If not tonight and then I'm gone
Whatever you say, oh, sure you're right
Only tonight, only tonight, only tonight

Ooh baby, oh baby, ooh
We've got love
No money, no diamond rings, ooh baby
We've got love

Ooh baby, oh baby
We've got love
Hold on, hold on, hold on
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love

We got it, we got it, we got it
We've got love
We got it, we got it

// Rainin' In My Heart //

Standing on the edge of the world
I'm looking for you, baby, yeah
I've keep looking at the sun
But it's rainin' in my heart

I don't know when life begins
I sure don't know when life might end, oh baby
I've keep looking at the sun
But it's rainin' in my heart, oh baby
(Rainin', rainin' in my heart)

Even though what's said or done
My love for you is eternal one
But how can I say bye with a love so deep
It seems like it's rainin' all over me

I can't understand for the love of me
Why can't it be like it used to be
Stop the rain, stop the rain
Rainin' in my heart

Seems like it was only yesterday
We're so in love, so in love just pays
I've keep looking at the sun
Somehow it keeps rainin' in my heart
Keep rainin', keep rainin', keep rainin'

Even though what's said or done
My love for you is an eternal one
But how can I say bye with a love so deep
I keep praying and it keeps rainin'

Somebody stop the rain
Yeah, now somebody stop the rain, rain, yeah
Somebody to see me
Somebody stop the rain, oh yeah

'Cause it seems like, seems like
Seems like it's gonna keep rainin'
It keeps on rainin', it keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin'
Keeps on rainin', keeps on rainin'

And how can I say bye

// I've Been Waitin' On You //

Oh baby

What's taking you so long?
I've been waiting on the phone
Oh, you haven't been home
Where have you gone?

What do you know
And where do you go
Oh, I love you so
I've been waitin' on you

Oh baby, let me hear

I got over you
You weren't real anyway
Oh, why did you say
I love you so

Before I learned my A B C
These things are true to me
Whole world to see
I've been waitin' on you, hey

Oh, baby, where did you go
I love you so, hey
Oh baby, thought you'd never go
I love you so
Where have you gone?

Where did you go?
Been calling out your name
Always the same
But I have enough to blame

Died over you
You wasn't real, no way
What did you say?
I've been waitin' on you

Hey, baby, oh

Baby, where did you go, I love you so
(I've been waitin' on you)
Got over you, oh no, it's true, oh yeah
(I've been waitin' on you)

(I've been waitin' on you)
Love you, baby, yeah
I'm gonna wait on
Waiting by the telephone
(I've been waitin' on you)

Why you ain't at home?
(I've been waitin' on you)
(I've been waitin' on you)

Waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin'
(I've been waitin' on you)
Hey, I've been waitin'
(I've been waitin' on you)
Waitin' on, waitin' on, waitin'

// Not Tonight //

You've been there from day one
You've been there since my life's just begun
I don't know just how to explain
How I feel about you, I feel about you

Girl, don't get on that train
And don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

'Cause I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

And I'd never go and leave you
That's one thing about me
I'll never go and deceive you
No, no, no

I'd never go and bring you
And then turn and go away from you
Away from you

Don't get on the train
Don't get on the train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

Listen, I'm in love with you
And I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Take my advice
Don't you never, never
Never, never, never
Think about it twice
All my life, all my life
One more time

Take my advice
Don't think about it twice tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't you dare get on that train
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
And I swear this love is true
Baby, not tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight

I'm in love with you
I swear, you know it's true
Baby, not tonight

Don't get on that train
Don't get on that plane
Baby, not tonight
Baby, not tonight
