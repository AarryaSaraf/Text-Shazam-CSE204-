Album: FullOfFire

// That's The Way It Is //

As the door over left behind to
Stand wide open for us to see
There is one thing in life I told you
I can see you but you can't see me, yeah

That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way it is

As my Father up in heaven above
Shining star that is full of love
And He is a big surprise that just open your hearts
And if that's one thing that I'm mighty proud of
You see now

There are sometimes when you make me happy
There are sometimes when you make me sad
But that's a part of life give it what you have
To all I ask is forget the bad

That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, sometimes that's the way it is
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way it is

All your smiles and your all your lies won't
Oh,  erase the pain inside, yeah
Hold your self and your serenity
'Cause I can see you this evening
And can't you see me, well?

That's the way, that's the way it is, yeah
That's the way, that's the way it is
That's the way, let me say that's the way it is
That's the way

And you must believe all the things I tell you
You won't believe all the words I say
Now one little thing in life I'm rest assured of
Heavenly father's gonna make a way in [?]

I will, yeah, I wanna clap my hands
Wanna clap my hands
Let me, let me clap my hands

// Always //

Always and forever each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me that somehow came true
And I know tomorrow will still be the same
'Cause we've got a life of love that won't ever change and

[Chorus:]
Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
I'll always love you

Forever, forever

There'll always be sunshine when I look at you
Something I can't explain just the things that you do
And if you get lonely phone me and take
A second to give to me that magic you make and

[Chorus]

Forever, Forever
Loving you is the thing that I plan
For a very long time
Me and you, you and me, we as one

// There's No Way //

There's no way
There's just no way
I could leave your love behind

If I could live my life all over, I'd do everything the same
The film in my camera would reveal everything the same
Like kissin' you every mornin', lovin' you day by day
Dreaming dreams of you and every old way will

When the sun peeps through my window
I'll have you on my mind
There's no way, there's no way
To leave your love behind

When you hair turns to silver and I'm old and gray
I'll keep on lovin' you, yeah, the same old way
When you come to the end of your journey
If I'm lucky enough to be around

I'll hold your picture to my chest
But tears will be still falling down, yeah
I'll keep you in my memory for the rest of my days
There's no way, there's no way to leave your love behind
Oh, behind, yeah

If I could walk through the garden again, you'd be the flower I pick
The episode of our love would give my heart a kick, yeah
If I could take the song from the top, one more time
I would sing the same old lines, yeah

I'll tell you there's just no way, no, no
There's no way to leave your love behind, behind
Oh, no, I can't leave it behind, oh

I can leave behind
Behind
Can't leave love, no
Behind
There's just no way

Behind
There's no way, no
Behind
It's still no

// I'd Fly Away //

If I had wings, I'd fly
I'd fly away
If I had a light to give
Each and everyday, no

And if the Angel of Love
Upon my shoulder
My very least is
To try and fly away, hey, hey

All this walking and talking
Mix my loud and easy, hey
All this rustlin' and tuslin' on the job
Life sure ain't green there, no

But if I had wings, oh this evening
Just enough for
And I had no words, no words to say
I'd fly away, hey, hey
I'd fly away, hey hey
Let me fly away, hey, hey

Yes, I'm flying
Flying
I'm flying right now, yeah
Ooh, I'd fly away

All of this talk about flying away
Looking here to the far blue yonder
Listen to me
I tell you that is sets my heart aglow, yeah
Kinda makes me wonder

The city of Angels with the light
That shines forever, I said forevermore
Makes me fly away, hey, hey
Oh, she will let me fly away, hey, hey
Make me fly away, hey, hey

Play this song, yeah
And how are you this evening?
For an Angel my wings
I'd fly, fly, fly, fly

I'd fly away, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

// Full Of Fire //

I'm full of fire
You're my one desire
Babe, I'm full of fire
You can make me cry

I can dance to the music
I can sing all night long
I can play with the band
Until you hear my song

Cause I'm full of fire
To see the party light
Hey, I'm full of fire
Think they're red and white

I can dance with the fire
Burnin', burnin' love
I can stay 'til the party is all over

Hey, I'm full of fire
And I'm over twenty one
Hey, I'm full of fire
And my life has just begun

I can dance to the music
Girl, I can understand
That there must be in life a power
That is holding my hand

Dance, dance, dance
I understand
Young lady, young man
I say I understand.

I can dance
Dance, dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Understand, understand, understand
There's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey, hey, I can dance
Dance, dance
Hey hey, I understand
Understand, understand, understand
There's some things I may not know
But I want the horns to blow
Hey hey, I can dance
Let me say I can dance
Full of fire, my heart's desire

// Together Again //

Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again

// Let It Shine //

I know a star that shines
But somewhere in your mind
You're always right on time
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I'm so glad that I'm free, yeah
Lord above would have blessed it on me
I don't mind, won't you let it shine?
Please be kind and let it shine, shine, shine

Well, I know the words to say
Gimme my daily bread, yeah
I never close my eyes, no
Always sleep, they're wise yeah

Now I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, yeah

Eh, I know a star that shine
Is somewhere in your eyes
You're always right on time, yeah
Yeah, won't you let it shine?

I know that you're fooling me
Can't take life so seriously
Broke my heart one hundred times
Now I want to let it shine, shine, shine, yeah, yeah

Sanctify feelings, let it shine
Tales all my in my mind, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine, yeah
Take me forth and let it shine
