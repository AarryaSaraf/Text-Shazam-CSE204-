// Happy News For Sadness //

You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it

My eyebrows are growing back in nicely
But I'm still ugly on the inside
We're at the ray kids movie
On the back of the rice krispies
It came out in 2003
Sure hope it's talking about the DVD

You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it

I like you better when you hated yourself
Every time I think about love
I think about me thinking about you

I'm changing your anatomy
Hipbone is connected to my heart
Every time I think about love
I think about you thinking about me

Nobody wants to know
(My eyebrows are growing back in nicely)
What you got to say at all
(My eyebrows are growing back in nicely)
Nobody cares about
(But I'm still ugly on the inside)
Your life and the people in it
(But I'm still ugly on the inside)
So you can stop talking about it

You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it

// Stoop Kid //

This city has its share of stairs, la da da da da da
And if you stay there, no one cares, la da da da da da
These boxes I should probably recycle
This city has its share of stairs, la da da da da da

I haven't eaten in so long
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
I'd like to travel the world, babe
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

The concrete breaks my heart again, la da da da da da
Some kid walks by, I spit at them, la da da da da da
The grocery store will still be there tomorrow
The concrete breaks my heart again, la da da da da da

I want a therapist more fucked up than me
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
Because I look in your eyes like a deer looks into headlights
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

If I had a little time
Maybe I could start to find my way out
But every time I move my feet, dance my way onto the street
I lose it
There's still beer cans on the step
I pretend that I have kept on purpose
But when the trashman comes around
I just start to feel so down I can't move

La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

I haven't eaten in so long
Stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
I'd like to travel the world, babe
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop

But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)
But stoop kid's afraid to leave his stoop
(But stoop kid's afraid to leave)

// Father, Flesh In Rags //

My back is killing me baby
I don't have any comfortable chairs
My spine will become warped
I won't be able to stand up straight

And I don't brush my teeth twice a day
Now I will lose them all in old age
La de da de da de da
I'll have to glue some fake ones on

Volcanic rock can be dated reliably
Genotypes, phenotypes
And I will have my father's bald spot
Dating method

C14

Have to remember not to smile
Will lead to wrinkles in later life
And don't furrow your brow
Your forehead will grow ridges

I wish I didn't have veins
My eyeballs can feel my heartbeat
La de da de da de da de da
Hair is dead skin particles

Volcanic rock can be dated reliably
Genotypes, phenotypes
And I will have my father's bald spot
Dating method

// Lawns //

December 27th: my dad walks in
I was 18 years old
He said "our trash can's blown over
The trash is all scattered across other people's lawns"
So I put on a jacket and I forgot my gloves
We went outside
It was cold as fuck

(I keep seeing these things out of the corner of my eye)

He gave me a trashcan, pointed across the street
Our trash was everywhere
So we went at it like an Easter egg hunt
Always more to be found
The wind started blowing
Every time I took my hands out of my fucking pockets
Shove 'em back in again

Bags from Kohl's and Target
Different colored gift wrap and thousands of receipts
I walked from lawn to lawn
I skipped the ones with fences and I grabbed all I could
The sidewalk I waited
(I waited)
I waited on the sidewalk, for my dad I mean
But I couldn't find him
He was nowhere to be seen

// P.O.W. //

Prisoners of war
They won't walk another step
They're just tired and they're fighting each other again
Prisoners of war
They don't need me anymore
I'll just play my Jew's harp at the prison door

And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to let them be all right

Prisoners of war
They're just humans after all
And what does it matter if they get away?
Prisoners of war
They won't need you anymore
All these borderlines have lied to us before

And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to let them be all right

And they've got to stick together
And they need to love each other
And they need to stick together to survive
And they don't know where they're going
They've just got to get away from all the soldiers
That would like to see them dead

Prisoners of war
There's no need to feel so down
You've got so much left to live for probably
Prisoners of war
I'd like to apologize
I see you've got your own nooses and I've got mine

And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to let them be all right

And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to make them fight all night
And it don't seem right to let them be all right

Prisoners of war
Prisoners of war
Prisoners of war
Prisoners of war

// Open-Mouthed Boy //

Last night I had a dream
I dreamed that I was pregnant
I could put my hand to my stomach
And feel another heart beating
I wanted to get an abortion
I didn't know how to tell my parents
It gave me a new outlook on women
I thanked God that I wasn't one of them

Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else

Last weekend I had a job
I had to water the neighbor's plants
But they looked like they were dying
No matter how much water I fed them
So I looked at the sky and asked God
"Why can't you make it rain a little?"
He said "because I don't like you"
So I called him a shit and ran away

Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
Who is that open-mouthed boy?
I think I've seen him in another movie
Who is that open-mouth boy?
I think I've seen him in something else
