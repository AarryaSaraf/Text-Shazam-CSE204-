It's like
Some thoughts and dreams


I'm lost inside this world

You're driving the car
I'll fall asleep

I love your neck
I want to live inside your neck

Besides
Wish I had 
Well now it's bigger
 fuck

In your suit and tie
You look so goddamn indestructible

I miss your womb
I would live
Inside your womb
If you had one

Every note I leave
Will come out
Wearing its feathered clothes

I regret not being able to stroke you off satisfactorarily

I was just a kid
I'm still just a kid
Run my fingers
Through your neck
I misheard
How am I going to kill myself?
