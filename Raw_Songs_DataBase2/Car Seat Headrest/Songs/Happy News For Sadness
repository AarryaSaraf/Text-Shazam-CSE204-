You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it

My eyebrows are growing back in nicely
But I'm still ugly on the inside
We're at the ray kids movie
On the back of the rice krispies
It came out in 2003
Sure hope it's talking about the DVD

You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it

I like you better when you hated yourself
Every time I think about love
I think about me thinking about you

I'm changing your anatomy
Hipbone is connected to my heart
Every time I think about love
I think about you thinking about me

Nobody wants to know
(My eyebrows are growing back in nicely)
What you got to say at all
(My eyebrows are growing back in nicely)
Nobody cares about
(But I'm still ugly on the inside)
Your life and the people in it
(But I'm still ugly on the inside)
So you can stop talking about it

You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
You can never tell the truth
But you can tell something that sounds like it
