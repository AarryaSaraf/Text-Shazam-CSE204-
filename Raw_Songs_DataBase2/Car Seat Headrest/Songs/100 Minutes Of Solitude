Was that a thing when we met last time
Was that me asking when we met this time
Would you mind all that's happening to come back again

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be 

You have a thing or two about you
Did you know a thing or two about me
Would you know I forgotten everything again

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be 

And when you go home you can never go home
And when you come back you can never come back
Noone tells you behind your back
Everything will be
