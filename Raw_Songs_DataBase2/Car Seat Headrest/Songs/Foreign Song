Hit my hand on a windowsill
Hit my head on a windowsill
Hope this doesn't mean
No one will come home with me

Put my hand on a windowsill
Hit my head on a windowsill
Hope this doesn't mean
No one will come home with me

I see you next to me
I see you next to me
I see you next to me
Oh, yes I do

Hit my hand on a windowsill
(I see you next to me)
Hit my head on a windowsill
(I see you next to me)
Hope this doesn't mean
(I see you next to me)
No one will come home with me
(Oh, yes I do)

(Oh, yes I do)
(Oh, yes I do)

(I see you next to me)
(I see you next to me)
(I see you next to me)
(Oh, yes I do)
