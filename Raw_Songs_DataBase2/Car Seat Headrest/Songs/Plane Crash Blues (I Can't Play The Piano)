This plane is going down
Anything to make you feel better
At least this time when it explodes into flames
No one could say that you're to blame

I forgot how to drive
That's why I'm taking this flight
With all of my shit piled on the passenger seat
I just couldn't keep my eyes on the street

Now I go
Oooh

This weather's making me crazy
Lightning keeps thinking it likes me
And I guess I can see why it wants to hit
But I am not a light though I am lit

I'm just cruising through the stop sign
Sorry officer, the radio was blowing my mind
They were playing a song that's gone out of tune
I'll take the rhythm but fuck them blues

I'm not sad I'm sad I'm not sad I'm sad not sad at all

That's not bad, man, keep going, you can do it, you already did it!
You can make no mistakes, you're perfect, you totally got this!
Just shut up shut up shut up shut up with all this negative vibes, all this yelling
Just shut up

And if your luggage got lost, you can leave without it
And if you run out of drugs, you can sleep without it, you know you can!
And if you want to go home, you can call a taxi
And if you don't want to talk, you can sit in the backseat

Ooh
