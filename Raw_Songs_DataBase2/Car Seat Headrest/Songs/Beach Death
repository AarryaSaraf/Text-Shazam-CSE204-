Woke up at dawn, there was ice on the lawn
And I was threatening to shoot the birds
The sun didn't come so you started to hum
A song that you never heard
I was alone so I called your phone
But you were just having too much fun
I thought it was raining so I looked at the painting
Of you sucking someone else's thumb

Someone's been messing with all of the questions
I've been asking my Ouija board
It spelt out 'goodbye' and it started to cry
And I watched it 'til I got bored
Took a break, I was starting to shake
And my amp was turned around
I started to play and I liked it that way
But my mom told me to turn it down

Don't wanna see, don't wanna watch
Don't want a season to go by
Someone took it from his bag
Someone explain

I went together, it was only the weather
That was getting my body down
So I took a vacation to another station
And I took pictures of the ground
I was getting stiff, so I jumped off a cliff
And landed at your feet
Told you something and you started to sing
A song that had no beat

Don't wanna see, don't wanna watch
Don't want a season to go by
Someone took it from his bag
Someone explain

I can't
Even finish
I don't
Want to
I can't
Even finish
I don't
Love you
