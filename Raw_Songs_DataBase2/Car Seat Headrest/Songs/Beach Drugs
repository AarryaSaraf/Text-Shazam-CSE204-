Taking a ride
Think I got so high on my aeroplane
We hit the sky
It was red and white like a candy cane

I get around
I get lost and found in my aeroplane
Would you go and say girl you don't 

You can fly
And I say goodbye to my aeroplane


Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
At all
No, no

Taking a ride
Think I got so high on my aeroplane
We hit the sky
It was red and white like a candy cane

I get around
I get lost and found in my aeroplane
Would you go and say girl you don't
