Hey Jane Doe
Is this another one?
Where the lady dies
Because the man had a gun

Was he a card carrying getaway all along?
Was the SAG-AFTRA wondering where he'd gone
I wonder where he'd gone

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You and I, are like two baby birds
Two birds who, know how to use words
The stranger would call the Car Seat, feel the hurt
We know exactly when it starts to hurt
Find the fish hook in the worm

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
We will ride that dick again

You know there's someone out there
God I know there's someone out there too
For me and you
Not me not you
You can't take me anyway

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
