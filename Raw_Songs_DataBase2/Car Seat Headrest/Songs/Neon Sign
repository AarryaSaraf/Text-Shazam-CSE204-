I was blind at the start, my sunglasses were far too dark
I was a danger to myself and to pedestrians
But lo' I did blink, at the sign that gave a wink
And told me that this establishment was open for business

It was a neon sign, that confused my eyes
And the disconnected lines, that were arranged in the letter 'i'

Walked up the window, and pressed it against my nose
And held hands with the people to my left and white
Black or white there was no, difference in that neon glow
And we told the world this establishment was open for business

Yes that neon sign, that opened my eyes
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'
Saw the neon sign, that disturbed my eyes
And my disconnected mind, told me everything was fine

And I voiced my sighs, to the neon sky
And the Lord came down in a glowing light
And the glowing light was the neon sign, that destroyed my eye
And the disconnected lines, in the shape of the letter 'i'
Paint the neon sign, that destroyed mankind
Cus' the voltage was too high, and the colors were too bright
For our disintegrated hands, that looked to the sign and read
And found out what looked as if, and it said
O-P-E-N
