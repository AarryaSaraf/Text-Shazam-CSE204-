You never stopped smoking, but I forgive you
My words and my heart were not enough to give you
And my words always sounded wrong, it was easy not to listen
Still it pained me to see when I left, you never noticed what was missing

After all that's unsaid and undone I know this can't mean much
But I hope that you find someone who loves you very much

No, I've never slept next to someone who wanted to sleep next to me
It was hard to debate, you couldn't wait to lose your memory
And it didn't take long, you were strong in your resolve to lose your mind
It was only a mistake that on the way you happened to lose mine

Yes, I know in your eyes we were never really lovers as such
So I hope that you find someone who loves you very much
And I hope that you find someone you can love just as much

Sometimes I wish I hadn't taken all my notes on your rolling papers
But when you burned them the scent was such a bittersweet vapor
I watched the flames silence the words I was given in life
But if your heart was in it I was glad to be your sacrifice

And though I'll miss or at least sometimes wish for your touch
I hope that you find someone who loves you very much

Death of the Lady Man
Such a drag

It's such a drag (Such a drag)
It's such a drag (Such a drag)
It's such a drag

You suck!
