My fingerprints are getting burned off
From using the too hot touchpad
Of my MacBook Pro
As I casually scroll through
The fetish-based forum
Of which I am an active member
I promise I will never use the term anthro-fiction

I haven't been outside since last week
When I went to the beach
Where I spent the whole time
Looking at the ocean wishing it was warmer
Where I spent the whole time
Looking for a stronger wireless signal
Because cellular net only had two bars
And was very unreliable

Because you always work on Thursday night
And I need something else to analyze
I'm making a fortune, painting you a portrait of the artist

Because you always work on Thursday night
And I need something else to analyze
I'm making a fortune, painting you a portrait of the artist
