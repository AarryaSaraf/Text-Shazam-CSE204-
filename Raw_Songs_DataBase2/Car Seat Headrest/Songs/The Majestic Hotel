Beach home on a sunny day
Washing all my trouble away
Sun will never rain on me
And I got sand all over my sandal

Boardwalk by the Lebanon 
 that it will not sail
Got it over like it never even fares
And I got sand all over my sandal
I got sand all over my sandal
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal

Woah, a week at the hotel
Woah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
