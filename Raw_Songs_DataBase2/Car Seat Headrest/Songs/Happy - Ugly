I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth
I like to laugh, but I don't like to hear me laugh
I like to dance, but I don't like to see me dance
I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth

Cause I'm so happy, I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, but I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, I'm so ugly yeah!



I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth
I like to laugh, but I don't like to hear me laugh
I like to dance, but I don't like to see me dance
I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth

Cause I'm so happy, I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, but I'm so ugly
I'm so happy, I'm so ugly yeah!



I like to smile, but I don't like to see my mouth
