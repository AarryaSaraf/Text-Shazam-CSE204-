Did you want to see me?
You didn't want to see me
Did you, old friend, I can you hear you stealing
Loving in the locker room
It's a careless mistake

How many people can fit into a robe?
When you stop drinking everything
Just starts to not invite me to your party
Lock the door on me

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

Did you ask me anything?
I didn't ask you anything
Think I understand just what's pretending to
Not ignore me
Sitting at your amber dress

Letter with an extra letter in my name
And we've known each other for far too long
To be losing punctuation on this alcohol

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
(See you there, see you there, see you there, Will)
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
(See you there, see you there, Will)
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

Did you want to see me?
You didn't want to see me
Did you, old friend, old friend, I can
Hardly remember all the times we slaved
Over our friendship

We had a share of hard times
Sign my yearbook, I don't wanna be in anymore
Debt to Mister Ray-Bans you didn't even like when you were in them

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

And I hope you have a good time, hope you have a good time when you're there

Did you ask me anything?
I didn't ask you anything
Think I understand just what's pretending to-


Yes?
Um, I need to go out for a while and get the van
Okay
 and then I'm gonna go grocery shopping, so I should be back by 1:40. Have you eaten anything today?
No
No?
Just waking up
