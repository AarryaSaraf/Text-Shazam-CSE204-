I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything

I can't make friends
I can't get a job
I can't shake hands
I can't go out

I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything

I can't play guitar
I can't sing loudly
I can't write words, that mean anything to me

I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally everything
I am afraid of literally anything
