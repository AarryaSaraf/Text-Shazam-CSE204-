I'm probably just tired
I'll love you again in the morning
I guess it was my fault
I must've missed the warning

That's not what I meant
You twisted the words right out of my mouth
Do you remember
What this was even about?

I'm probably just tired
I'll love you again in the morning
I guess it was my fault
I must've missed the warning

I can't explain
Just keep going round and round and round and round
If you could see my brain
See it pound and pound and pound and pound

I'm probably just tired
I'll love you again in the morning
I guess it was my fault
I must've missed the warning

My heart can't take this
Why are you trying to hurt me, if you love me, why are you hurting me so goddamn much?
Honey if we keep fighting I won't ever get to sleep
And if I never get to sleep, I'll never see the morning, I won't ever love you again

But if we get to sleep
I'll sleep next to you

And honey if we ever get to sleep
In the morning we will
Rise
Rise
Rise

In that bright blessed morning
Rise
Rise
Rise

Let's get to bed
