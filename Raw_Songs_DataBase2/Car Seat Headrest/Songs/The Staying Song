I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
I want to close my head in something heavy with a locking mechanism
It's just bad timing, I only moved here two weeks ago
And the rent was so expensive, my parents would kill me if I left

I dropped every pick I have on the floor
It'll take me so long to pick them up
And I don't have the strength to put on my clothes
And I don't have the strength to open the blinds

I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
Don't unplug the alarm clock until I'm done with this
I want to put duct tape in sensitive areas and rip it off
And a buzzsaw to divide perpendicular sections of my brain

I hate the fluorescent light so I'm sitting here in the dark
And I don't have the strength to go to a restaurant
And I don't have the strength to pour a bowl of cereal
I want to chew through electric wires and electrocute myself
