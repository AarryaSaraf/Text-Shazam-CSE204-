He knew what everyone was looking for
He found a market and capitalized upon it
He'd always look me straight in the eyes when he was talking
He'd give the world a more presentable version of himself

He spoke in terms of what we wanted rather than what he wanted
(He presented his argument in a convincing manner)
He presented his arguments in a convincing way
(And he always had a smile on his face that was ever)
Whenever he spoke the room fell silent, not as if they were scared of him
(Condescending, but always cheerful, as if he was just so happy to see you)
But as if they were really scared

I want to
I want to

Dare I say, an honest man (I want to)
Dare I say, an honest man (I want to)
