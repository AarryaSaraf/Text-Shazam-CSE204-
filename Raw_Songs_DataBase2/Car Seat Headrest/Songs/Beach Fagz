Woke up, had a boner
Dragged a comb across my boner
I said it's high time for us to experience high tide
No thanks I don't drink and oh god are you drunk
What you've done this vibrato isn't helping things much
No one should trust my statement of faith
Cause I didn't make eye contact and I kept touching my face

Be honest
But not that honest
Be honest
But not that honest

I think I know where the bathrooms are here
I've been going to this restaurant for 17 years
For a minute there
I thought you were twice as tall as me
You're no Spencer and I'm no Dan
But we'll sound like Wolf Parade much as we can
For a minute there
I thought you were twice as tall as me

Not that honest
We'll be honest
Not that honest
Be honest
Not that honest
We'll be honest
Not that honest

You said, "why don't you just grab the brush from da Vinci
And tell him how he could be doing it better"
I said
"You're supposed to call him Leonardo"

I wish I was a kid with an adult boyfriend
I wish I was dead
