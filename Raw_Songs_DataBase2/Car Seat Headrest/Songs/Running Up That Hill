It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?

It's you
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Said if I only could, oh

You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
There is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me we both matter, don't we?

It's you
It's you and me
It's you and me and we won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Said if I only could, oh

It's you
It's you and me
It's you and me and we won't be unhappy

C'mon baby, c'mon darlin'
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

Said if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problem

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get Him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
With no problem

Said if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
