There is a vein
In my head
That will explode
When I'm old
I don't know
I just do what I'm told
That's what you said
That's what you said
My blood
Streets of 1994
My love
Lying naked on the floor
We don't talk any more
And I don't know why
Cause I'm really shy
But I hurt you, man
Do you even want me around

There's a bug
In my mind
That wakes me up
All the time
Back to sleep
But it won't keep
Until I find
That's what you want
My blood
Straight from an open wound
My love
Bleeds like it's addicted to you
But I still love you
But I don't want to
But I still do
But I'll help you, man
Do you even want me around
