With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long

Let the love pour in, let the love
Let the love pour in, let the love

Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green

Let the light pour in, let the light
Let the light pour in, let the light

In the sun
It was love
In the sun

Let the love pour in, let the love
Let the light pour in, let the light
