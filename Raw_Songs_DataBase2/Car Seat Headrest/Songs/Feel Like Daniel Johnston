There's a guy who makes some tunes, so simple and so sweet
He makes me laugh, he makes me cry, his songs are pretty neat
He seems as though he is all alone, no lovers and no friends
But I'm afraid I'm gonna turn out like him in the end

I feel like Daniel Johnson
I feel like Daniel Johnson
Or is it "Daniel Johnston"?
Or is it "Daniel Johnston"?
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Daniel Johnston

There's a guy who makes these movies, always sad but true
He's always thinking about death and how he will die too
I'm a big fan of his films but I don't want to be
A neurotic just like him, thinking of the death of me

I feel like Donald Kaufman
I feel like Donald Kaufman
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I feel like Charlie Kaufman
I feel like Charlie Kaufman

I've been asking all these questions, but I must confess
I've already resigned myself to sad sad loneliness
So I lock the door, throw away the key, and never face my fear
I got my music, got my TV, I think I'll just stay here

I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Daniel Johnston
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
Or is it "Charlie Kaufman"?
I think it's "Daniel Johnston"
I think it's "Charlie Kaufman"
I feel like Daniel Johnston
I feel like Charlie Kaufman
