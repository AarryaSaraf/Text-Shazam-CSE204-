Everyday I love you
But you just want to ignore me
That is not such a healthy relationship
Today I went to a show
And no, I didn't talk to anyone at all
Today I went to a show
And no, I should really learn how to speak
Baby

Ooh
Yeah

I thought I saw a star
But it was just a plane
I thought I saw the moon
But it was just you

Baby, I wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk
