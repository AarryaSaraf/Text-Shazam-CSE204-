I think you could be beautiful
I wouldn't love you if you were
Eyes the size of light bulbs
Irises sharpie dots

Sometimes I think you're beautiful
I don't love you when you are
Every other day like this
Alone on the bedroom floor

Let's stare each other in the face
Don't tell me we are not in space
The rags we started out with
The rags we ended up with
I'll text you walking on your legs
I'll need to see you when I'm dead
I said you know that when we kiss
It's never on the lips so

You can talk
You can talk
You can talk!
You can talk!

Sometimes a cigarette, is just a phallic symbol
I've come up sporting half a haircut, that scissors couldn't fix
And sometimes a cigarette, is just a good way to die
My legs around your back, I just needed words to sing

Never look me in the eye
Cause yours see so much more than mine
The rags with which we started out
The rags with which we ended up
You walk with spine curved backwards
I'd like to be your actor
I can't get to sleep until I know
For sure that you've moved on

You can talk
You can talk
You can talk!
You can talk!
You can talk!
You can talk!
