I am a thief of unimportant things
I am a cheat and I can't do anything to stop myself
I have no code, there is no road I'm traveling down
There's only footprints leading away from the windowsill

It's a devil moon
It's a hollow moon

There's always half of the world in darkness at a time
We're always creeping towards that black horizon line
Maybe if I tried, I could keep on the sunny side
But I'm just too in tune with the moon
