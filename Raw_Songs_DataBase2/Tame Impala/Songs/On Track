I close my front door and turn on the light
I let out a breath and hold in a sigh
Ain't nothin' new, ain't that much inside
And if I'm counting days, dream fruition ain't what it's looking like

But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding on
One other minor setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still in sight
Strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
I lost a wheel a while back
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Trouble keeps falling in my lap
Strung out again, but still on track

I know it's unrealistic, over-optimistic
I know I tried before this, I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this, looking forward to all this
Sayin', "Babe, I just adore this" and, "Babe, can we afford this?"
I know it's been a slow year, nothin' much to show here
I didn't really go for it, so not a lot to show for it

The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over, I want to bring us closer
The world ain't changin' for ya', nothin' to lose it over
We're just a shuttle over, the rest comes easy
The rest comes easy

('Cause life's like that)
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
Strictly speaking, I'm holding back
Troubles keep falling in my lap, yeah
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
'Cause, strictly speaking, I've got my whole life
One other major setback
But strictly speaking, I'm still on track, yeah

The hardest part is over, adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over, I want to bring us closer
The world ain't waitin' for ya', nothin' to lose it over
I just kept getting older, the rest gets easy
The rest gets easy
