Feel it come, I don't know how long
It's gonna stay with me, I'll let desire be, desire go
Oh, dare I face the real world

Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll get out, won't have to check my watch

I don't have the verve to belong to this dead side
Why I ever tried, I don't know
Oh, dare I face the real world

Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
What's it for? Back and forth, everyday
Everyday, back and forth, what's it for?
I don't know, I'll forget try to let desire be, desire go

Feel, feel it come, feel it come
Feel it come, I don't know how long
It's gonna stay with me, I'll let desire be, desire go
