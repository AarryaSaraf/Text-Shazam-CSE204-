It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
And if you're telling me that I've got so much to lose
All the talking about it, it's all noise

Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?

Let it out
I can see it now
Tryin' to hold down
I hear it now

All the constants in your future bore you
Kinda makes your mind up for you
Knowing just what lies before you
Gives you no surprise

It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?
