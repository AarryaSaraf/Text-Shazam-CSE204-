It's the retina show for you eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
It's the retina show for you eyes
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry

If you don't think it then it won't show
And you believe it too
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you

Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love
Make me, make me feel love

It's the retina show for you eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry

If you don't think it then it won't show
And you believe it too
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you
Baby, tonight, it's written all over you

It's the retina show for you eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
It's the retina show for you eye
It's the ego of instinctive desire
It's the reason that you make me break down and cry
