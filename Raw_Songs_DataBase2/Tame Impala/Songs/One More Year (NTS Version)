Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
Now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

All we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now it's all we live for
Might be what we die for
Oh

But it's okay
I think I know a way
It's so clear
Why don't we just say, "One more year"?
One more year
One more year
Oh-oh-ah
One more year

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might
I know we promised
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might

Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now we're shining
Nobody beside me
Future is exciting
Oh

Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

Has slowly become all we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
It might be what we die for
'Cause now we're shining
Somebody guide me
Future is exciting

One more year
One more year
