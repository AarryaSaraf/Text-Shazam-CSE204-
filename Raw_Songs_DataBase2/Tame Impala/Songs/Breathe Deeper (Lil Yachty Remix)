Baby girl wanna kick it
Spend late nights, tryna impress the wicked
Off two tabs, I'm gone
Mind too fried, couldn't remember the digits
She want a glass of Prosecco
The bitch that she with trippin', leave her at the Petco
I'm still the same kid from the metro
She ride out of drugs, had to ball call petrol
Lookin' in her eyes, see the meadow
Lookin' at her lips, pillow kiss, it's the wet throat
She say she never been to the ghetto
Put her on the tab, turn the hood to a disco
Now she rockin', and I'm rockin', and we feelin' it out
All that energy I held in, I'm givin' it out
I forgot 'bout my problems, I'm livin' it up
I can not feel my feet, I been dancin'
I been grindin' my teeth while she rantin'
Everybody shut the fuck up and start dancin'

Gridnin' my teeth while she rantin'
Look in my eyes, I can't touch, it's the madness


Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one


Dim lights, tonights, wanna go again
Loose legs, all on my back, can't feel the wind
I see stars every time I hold your hand
You can leave your car, self-drive in a brand new Benz
Loosen up your guard
Hope this shit last, I don't want it to end
Hope you do your part
I just need you to snap in both in of your hands
Mm, like that
I love the way you move when it like that
Heard you paid all of your dues with a rain check
You turned me to a fool for insane sex
You passed the love test
Join the mile-high club on the plane next
Heart beatin' like 
I can't wait to shut the fuck up and dance though


Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one


Remember those lies you told your friend?
I was hopin' you could do it once more again
That rooftop party won't seem to end
I need you here, alone with me
My love and my high, don't break my heart
You're all I got, you all I need
Don't leave me cold outside to rot
But I'm so depressed I feel bulimic
My soul restored, I want a call
Fuelin' your heart to me, I mean it
DMT which is inside my brain
I had dinner with God, just thank God I seen Him
Heaven's too real, the dream won't fill
Trust me, with my own eyes, baby girl, I seen it
Late night vibes, I need your high
Let me get one hit, baby girl, I'm fiendin'
In too deep to cut my ties
I'm way too hot, I just left Venus
Try my best to make you smile
Never said that I was perfect, I still fight demons
IPhone pics, I saw that story
Look drunk as fuck, I think you need me
Rubbing your body just like it's gold
Your dress is the bottle and you the genie
O-M-G, let's spice things up
I got a little bit of ecstasy in my feelings
Lovin' on you is takin' its toll
I hope you still gonna love me and that you mean it

Love me and that you mean it
Love me and that you mean it
