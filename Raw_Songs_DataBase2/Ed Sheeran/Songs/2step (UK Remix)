I know I promised you the world when I didn't have it
You say I'm a liar, I don't care but that's a bit dramatic
You know I've got enough stress, I'm living post-traumatic
I know we're bigger than a picture or a silly caption
I like you in real life, I'm bending over backwards
And love the way you love me, I find you so attractive
Flight mode, we don't need no distractions
And we ain't walking down the street unless you hold my handgun
Maybe I'm just a schmuck who really can't believe his luck
But he's just hoping he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard
So we learned to adjust and take the smooth with the rough
Your skin smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup
She know I ain't like them fools in the club
I'm grinding so we got a house on the hill
A boat for the  and a pool 
Till then I'm two-stepping in the mud

We'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing
When I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels
To be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come
When I feel the dark, and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest
Are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays

We'll go all night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing
When I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels
To be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
