Drop it

Hey

Ugh


Try to crack

And some will react

Vocal snap so trap 

I'm trying to rap


Those who try to subdue 

the truth

lose their condition 

were labelled inactive


Being 91

the twentieth century

Brooklyn is a magnum in the bottle of kerosiene


flame ignites into the black

sending fright

thought you could read minds 

and words and insight


Backin' the explosion on stage

guns fear

Frances Fanon

presence of war


Using my brain

Until the power is obtained

Using my strength to gain

A struggle for rage


But I

Choose another tune to uplift

Yeah, you know my anger is a gift

a gift to expect the test we all must face

Hah,

Out my face


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


C'mon

In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Some are the holders of power

But the style will  shower 

Trying to like brothers about the structure itself

Pay only motivates and creates more hate


State to state

I set it straight

I investigate

Debate, the ?? who brought me lessons


At the oppression I react with aggression

Yo 

My section after section


No need for repressing

Just take a mic 

and a rap another session


No need for guessing

Yeah

And that shit that your stressin'


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


C'mon


In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Ugh!


UGH!


I'm on the mic

Stepping up to sucka's

while were drumming out the style

and I do it with a smile


When I put punks on trial

Taking 'em back again

Yeah the name of the comprehender


The style I drop is going on and on

To the punks to recognize the style

Andrealize

That I'm not no Punk Kid

Just stepping up for the mic hit


Ugh!

In the narrows


In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Ugh!
