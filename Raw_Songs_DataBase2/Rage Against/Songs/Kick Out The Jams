We're gonna kick 'em out


Well I feel pretty good

And I guess that I could get crazy now' baby

We all got in tune

When the dressing room got hazy


I know how you want it

When you're hot and tight

The girl cant stand it

When you're doing it right When they're up on the stand

And then they kick out the jams

Kick out the jams, We're gonna kick 'em out


And I'm starin' to sweat

You know my shirt's all wet

What a feeling now baby

And the sound that abound and resounds and rebounds straight off of the ceilin'

You gotta have it baby

You cant do without

You get that feelin' gotta kick 'em out

Put that mic in my hand

And let me kick out the jams

Yeah, kick out the jams, we gotta kick 'em out


Got to get it up

You know you can't get enough Miss McKenzie

'Cause it gets in your brain

It drives you insane' a loopy frenzy

We got a guitar and a crash on the drums

If you wanna keep on rockin' till the mornin' comes

Let me be who I am

And let me kick out the jams

I done kicked 'em out
