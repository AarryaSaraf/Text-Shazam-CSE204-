Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for tha dawn
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for tha dawn

Tha spirit of Jackson
Now screams through tha ruins
Through factory chains
And tha ghost of tha union
Tha forgotten remains
Disappear to their new homes
Tha knife tha thrust
Tha life burns to tha raw bone
Tha blood on tha floor of tha tear is still dryin'
Cover tha spread sheets
Tha Dow Jones skyin'
Tha cell block live stock
Tha bodies they buyin'
Old south order
New northern horizon

Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, Embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare
I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, Embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare
I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set

Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as the wheat grows strong
Hungry people don't stay hungry for long
They get hope from fire and smoke as they reach for tha dawn

Yo, yo, check tha high tech terror
Of tha new order athletes
Peering into tha eyes of tha child already on trial
These armies rippin' families apart
Get 'em on file
Convictions fit tha stock profile
All tha while films of dogs
Ripping through homes
Ripping skin from bones
Yes tha new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes
An era rising
Of tha old south order
New northern horizon

Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, Embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare
I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)
Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
(Violence in all hands, Embrace it if need be)
Livin' been warfare
I press it to CD
(Livin' been warfare, I press it to CD)

A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set
A fire in tha master's house is set
