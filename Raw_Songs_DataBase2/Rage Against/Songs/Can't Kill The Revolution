Living on the street shores

He didn't learn and wanted children

Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"

He doesn't wanna see it..



He didn't wanna deal with it

Here they come, feelings that come as natural

Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all

He doesn't wanna see it...



Running away, getting some kinda cure

"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him



Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Don't run away, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love...





You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution





You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution



Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves

Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness

Suicide or a slower death from addiction

seemed to be the only way to stop the pain



Running...
