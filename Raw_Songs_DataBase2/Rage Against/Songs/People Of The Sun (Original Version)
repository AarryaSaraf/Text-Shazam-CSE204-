Yea...the bastard son is in

swimming in a sea of funk

clear tha lane, I'm gonna have to dunk ya

Up and down like a donut in a caffenated drink

so make a scene I take it to the brink

Check around the style of it

If the price is right ill take you on a trip

In my old school 62

Shoes are white and blue somethin you never want to step to

Space My Bassline

Feel the earthquakin

when you shortside my automatic

White Folks came and they try to steal my name

But now I got a gun

This is for the people of the sun




I'm not a silent one

I'm a defiant one

Never the normal one 

Cause i'm the bastard son

Shift away before the sky sees blood

And that was just away from mother earth

I'm tearin' up a big fat chunk of the funk

led a lead I gotta dunk Never smoke a skunk

On the set, humble, shove anotha punta

I got a product six shooter 

Face my bassline

Feel the earth quakin'

Cause when they short side my mathematics

You take it from my culture

White Folks came and they try to steal my name

But now I got a gun

This is for the people of the sun
