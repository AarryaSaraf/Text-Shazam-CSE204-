[Hook: x2]
East side niggas stay bout it
West side niggas stay bout it
North side niggas stay bout it
South side niggas stay bout it bout it

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
G.I. niggas stay bout it
Take a nigga life don't doubt it
Church and the liquor store crowded
911 is a joke don't dial it
We ain't really trippin' when the money stay pilin'
Money comin slow then mothafuckas get violent
I just want a crib and a coupe low mileage
Gon' hustle dope with a yellow bone stallion
So high, and niggas wanna know why I, ride
With semi automatic by my, side
Cause I got niggas comin at my, head
But I won't let them bitches stop my, bread
A mothafucka wanna show my, dough
I hit him twice with the black fo-fo
The witness, courtroom don't, show
And what a nigga don't know, won't, go
'Dro hoes in the dope game major
On the front page magazine, no label
Industry don't want 'em cause the niggas too gangsta
Probably never heard em on ya radio station
Way too thug for these mothafuckin' raps
Rap way better then ya neighbourhood trap
Man came down on the uppity bitch
I be fuckin' the bitch, let my niggas smash right after
Dope in the kitchen gotta get it stretchin' n whippin'
Know some niggas that slippin, we can hit a lick if you with it
Then I ship it to Liver, I ain't took a trip in a minute
Now I'm in the position, I can give it to my lieutenant
Need a mothafucka robbed I'm the nigga for the job
Peace to the Slam and the 5-Trey Mob
What you know about that life in the mask
Them Gary, Indiana niggas gift wrap the casket, how you love that?

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Yea, I ain't got time for these bitches
Ain't gotta dime for these bitches
Breakin' it down for 3 bitches
Duffle stuffed with 3 6's
Heat under the pillow, I sleep with' my Mrs
And I'm havin' dreams that's bigger than 6 digits
Nickels while I rest, possessed to whip chickens
Livin' though you addicted, to hit the next shipment
So high, and niggas wanna know why I, ride
With semi automatic by my, side
I need a nigga that's fosho gon' bust
And really I'm the only nigga I, trust
And really I'm the only nigga that, cold
New shoes, cadillac on, fo's
Shine for the dimes and the rat, hoes
Check a pack, write a rap, crack, sold
And my trunk leave cracks in the pavement
Chevy only carry heavy weight, gon' save 'em
Just another victim of the game, can you blame 'em
And he stay paid, can't a lame nigga fade 'em
And most of you niggas in the rap game dick blowers
But at the end of the day, don't get shit for it
But me and mine's gotta eat, so I'm beatin' up the street
Dinner time, man, I gotta hit a lick for it
Send 'em to God, tryna rob the godfather
And if you scared of catchin' a murder then why bother
I'm peelin' off a knock for pots of hot water
Niggas wrote me off and it made me grind harder
Peace to the East, nigga peace to the chief
Got a slug for the judge, bringin' heat for police
And a book full of sins that I read when I sleep
Then I wake up 'n I put 'em on a beat, how you love that?

[Hook x4]

// Still Livin' //

What you know boy [x14]

[Verse 1:]
I'm still livin like a dope dealer
And these streets they got no mercy on a broke nigga
Gangsta Island so all my niggas gang bangers
Girls come get your cook up
I came up with the cane slangers
And I grew up next door to the dopeman
Chevy red CL coupe clean as a coke can
DEA been doing surveillance they in the dope van
Nowadays they pay Walter Payton that's 34 bands
Yea, I'm still living like a jack boy
Got your family wrapped up in tape, I'm 'bout the sack boy
And I heard it ain't where you from it's where you at boy
Make sure every place that I'm at next to the strap boy
Killing em, shit from these verses put holes in hearses
And these truckers need some product to purchase some at their service
Used to sale my yellow and nextel play for the chirpers
Ain't no doubt we don't check out CTE they close the curtains

[Hook:]
And I'm still, still livin like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger I ain't taking shit from no nigga
Still, I'm still living like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic what you know boy
And I'm still, still livin like a dope dealer
Finger on the trigger I ain't taking shit from no nigga
Still, I'm still living like a dope boy
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic what you know boy

[Verse 2:]
Still cashing at dope check
Guns a contraband know that
Street said that I marked for death
And might be the one to give smoking next
Might fuck around might beat it down
That ass round and that throat wet
You a pussy boy straight cold Tecs
Got a hundred rounds bitch hold that
Bitch hold that, bitch hold up
Bitch know what that 4 bust
Bought a 14 of that straight hard
And served every geeker that rolled up
That straight trap with no raps with me
OT but they pack with me
Moonwalking on dope bitch I know real niggas on Jackson street
25th, 49th, cali kush over night
Come back to my store dawg to make sure you got your order right
And my shop might close up so make sure you put your orders in
Just another day another dollar ducking court again
Wrapping up the pack of drugs traffic watching out
Winter summer spring fall nigga shovel snow
And if I could I'd dig a tunnel straight to Mexico
Pass me my strap I think the police at my door because I'm

[Hook]

// The Diet //

[Hook: Pharrell]
You should be only interested in those who put you on the G
You can hang out with the haters or you can hang out with me
Shawty tell 'em if you can't break it down from A to Z
Hey I'm on a little diet gotta stay hater free
You gotta go [x7]

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Talking reckless, but I ate that thang for breakfast
And I'm ready keep on that ring left on my Nikes and my necklace
Ain't no hickies on this sticky, keeping shit secret when we sexing
Go to GI bout my BI rolling in the new 650 flexin
Talking about some top with the top down, what you talk?
Hot sex, champagne all night
You ain't 'bout that life, baby keep on walking
I sweat the weave out
Girl you know the play before we leave out
Cuddle up, double up take them to the suite
Finna show these hoes what this cheese about, Gangsta Gibbs

[Bridge:]
Maybe she will if she wanna
Maybe she do what she don't
Cause we be on the pimp shit
You gon get your bitch flip, I just wanna hit, get ghost
Shots to the head let's toast, twist up the flame
Pledge allegiance to the realest niggas getting it in this game
Serving things, made my motherfucking name
Gangsta Gibbs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Right back in her, and I ate that thang for dinner
And I Chi-town ride in the summertime, on the West Coast in the winter
Man, I fucking left her fiending, dog, it was so cold how I did her
And she hate my guts but she always gon' be right there when I hit her
Talking about some top on the top floor, what you talking
Hot sex, champagne all night
You about 'bout that life baby keep on walking

Puerto Rican, Asian, I hope you like girls
Got a whole pound and broke some more down
You can get tore down tonight girl

[Bridge]

// Money, Clothes, Hoes (MCH) //

[Hook:]
And I stay up on my toes

For money, clothes, hoes [x3]
And I stay up on my toes
Money, clothes, hoes [x3]
They say anything goes
For money, clothes, hoes [x3]

[Verse 1:]
I got diamonds on my wood, bitches on my phone
Sturdy hoes like those they just can't leave this dick alone
You remind me of my chick, got that for the bros
Took less than a week to hit that sweet and take it out
Pussy open for a pimp, make your daddy proud
Boy I bet she goes, she blow this dick I blow this pound
And we stay on purple drank OG in my wood
Only smoke that Cali shit I put that on my hood
I be thugging to the death of me straight G.I. rider
Ain't no pussy in my pedigree

I just sit back and let this reefer get the best of me
And now I be thugging to the death of me straight G.I. rider
Ain't no pussy in my pedigree
I mix the Molly with the Kesha that's my recipe
I just sit back and let this reefa get the best of me
And niggas know that

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Got Versaces on my frame, Fendi on my waist
Girl you keep that thing up sit right up here on my face
She got that super wet, we get super freak
Keep it on the low don't put my business in the street
You remind me of my chief something like my sound
Girl you know what's up you turned it up I beat it down
It's the realest niggas in it you already know
Gangsta of the year, got like 4 times in the row
I be thuggin' to the death of me straight G.I. rider

// The Hard //

[Intro/Bridge: Dana]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Verse 1: Freddie]
Hit the block, dressed in white, same Bo Jackson Nikes
Call my partner Mike, copped a pint, put fo' in my Sprite
55 a line, that's aight cause I'm 'bout that life
Pussy on my mind, bitch you tired, it's that mouth tonight
Weed and waffles in the morning
Downtown Chicago, smoking on some shit that I imported
MDMA, light up a J, sometimes she like to snort it
And shit was too dry with that Tony, bitch now I'm reloaded
Bitch I'm reloaded
And I'm chopping up the hard, dopeboy I played my part
Fuck with the gangsta type, ain't got no stripes, then you's a mark
Smoking Carolina Blue fresh out the Carolina Park
So much gunplay in the day, just might be safer in the dark
And this Glock ain't got no safety, the owner got no patience
So please don't make my finger and this trigger make relations
Said this Glock ain't got no safety, straight make yo ass a patient
Guess I'll slang until my grave or take that federal vacation
Nigga, nigga

[Bridge]

[Hook: Freddie]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These geekers say they on it so I'm chopping up the hard, nigga

[Verse 2: Freddie]
Whip the crack, dressed in black, just picked up a pack
Feeling great, dropped some 28s, got 'em jumping back
Jumping up, what the fuck, G.I. they don't fuck with us
Most these niggas out the Mid wasn't breathing 'til I bust a nut
Rob a nigga, father figure, dope house was my college nigga
Plus my part time job didn't make no dollars, I'm a water whipper
See through you like windows, basis of your heart is artificial
Mob of hungry niggas like we came straight out of Mogadishu
What's the issue? Stack full of pancakes and my pistol
Shit official, when you see the police, nigga hit that whistle
They out to get you, so fuck all my opponents
They can peel me off this corner cause I know...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dana]
I know that lifAnnotatee is short
(Life's short, know what I'm saying, you gotta get moving, know what I mean)
But we can't move too fast
(Know what I'm saying, I ain't tryna run a race or no shit like that, you know)
Cause if we go right now
(Nigga just tryna get out here and chop, chop it up and get mine, you know
Piece of the pie)
It will never last
In the morning
When the sun comes up
And everything is cold
It's a new day
And all of it is beautiful
Or so I thought

[Freddie:]
Just let me make it to another morning [x4]

[Hook]

// Kush Cloud //

[Hook:]
Floatin off of that kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
That kush cloud, that kush cloud
My kush cloud, my kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
Rolling off of that kush cloud
OG turnt up too loud
That kush cloud, that kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
That kush cloud, that kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
My kush cloud, my kush cloud
Floatin off of that kush cloud
Rolling off of that kush cloud
OG turnt up too loud, bitch

[Verse 1: Freddie]
Mo-murder, mo-murder
In the Tahoe with my burner
Tell 'em that I just got a shipment in
And if you in to win then I'll serve ya
Know I'm floatin off of that kush cloud
OG turnt up too loud
A nigga busy getting to the money and weed
That's why a playa hating nigga get tuned out
In a shootout nah cause they don't want that shit
Traffic the powder, how you want that whip?
Grind it out, pound it out
Then I took her to the house, I ain't want that bitch
I get the killa shit from my niggas in the Bay
We wheeling and dealing so what you niggas wanna pay?
Got dope in the attic, I'm in the ceiling with the yay
We flipping it really, you pussy niggas in the way
Got thug love from my niggas choking, smoking bud
Bought my dope from Lil' Sodi yea I fucks with cuz
Corporate thuggin, so all I'm wit is thug niggas
Can you picture, this rapper slash drug dealer

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Krayzie]
I said I was never gon' smoke no mo'
20 minutes late, okay I'm a smoke one mo'
The next thing you know, I'm blowing through the whole O
Smoke alarm going off, popo knocking on my do', oh
I'm a real OG chief choker
Green leaf stoner, real weed smoker
Wanna kick it with me, you better bring weed over
I got too many problems, ain't no need to be sober
But I ain't really waiting on you niggas to split it
Roll it and hit it cause I've already got me some
Roll another nigga, I'm hardly done
Kray Jack got Bob Marley lungs
I hit a little bit of Snoop OG kush
Then I roll up some Wiz Khalif to get a hook
It's sticky icky nigga, trust it be real
Cause I planted it and grew it on Cypress Hill
Bud smokers only, bud smokers only, on-ly
Don't ask if I'm high
Look into my eyes, you can tell that I'm zonin', zonin'
Kray and Freddie Gibbs, nigga there it is
Midwest get ready when I come around the corner in my spaceship
And we take off into the cloud

[Hook]

[Verse 3: SpaceGhostPurrp]
She rolled up a sack of that, purp
The mystical haze got her going in a maze
While she twerkin and workin slow motion - I am the potion
That will dwell inside the magical purp that you inhale
Inside your mind as I, seduce your brain cells
You gotta get high 'til you can't tell
If you in heaven with the angels
Playing my music and get high to it
It's hypnotizing like a brain spell
Real nigga smoking on purple trees
All about money, gotta count this green
Mackin these bitches and I'm gettin to the riches
And yo bitch love smoking me
When the beat break down (break down)
Get lost to the sound (to the sound)
Roll the window down (down)
Let her see the kush clouds (kush clouds)
Ride around through the town (town)
Nigga let the wind blow (wind blow)
Gotta get head in the front seat slow
Let a nigga see the kush smoke

[Hook]

// Walk In Wit The M.O. //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Skin tight pants muff print no underwear
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
She give me head in a Carrera and cruise
She addicted to the D-boyz talking that street slang
That keep the dick up in her 2 feet in the D game
Standing on the bus stop mama hold my bag of rocks
Jumped up out that hooptie this summer baby we in the drop
Spend it and flaunt it take your pick however you want it
Don't mind bitches my side bitches knocked off opponents
They simply leasing this penis but baby I'm the owner
My Compton bitch hear polices rate me in California
So I done cut a lot of hoes off
I activate this actavis so I can dose off
And I don't argue with no bitch I set that straight from the gate
Bet all my mack and money makers relate
I'm just a player baby

[Hook:]
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at baby?
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at?
It's always money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at baby?
That's why it's money over bitches
I steps in with the mo where the hoes at?

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
This might be hard as it get
I bought an ounce on the first like it was part of my rent
I'm in Paris drinking mo thank God for this shit
Cause I'm from south central baby pardon my french
Yea I know ball players, James Harden and shit
Cash a check in New York at the Garden and shit
Heard The Yellow Album now she part of the clique

Oh you getting head now look I taught her this shit
This nigga treat her like she your daughter and shit
Type of nigga golfing with her father and shit
Found out I was fucking, he was bothered a bit
I'm a cool nigga it's not a problem to switch
Look you in yo face what type of problem is this
Caught him on the chin then he stumbled a bit
The right then left niggas rumbled and shit

// Krazy //

[Intro:]
I know we made an agreement
Yeah we both path
Just to do all our thing
Krazy

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Staring at the world thru versace lenses
Moving Tony with my homie cause he's bout the business
If we make it to a birdie then we cop Benz
Sound good until a nigga end up in the prison
Look at me I'm the definition of detrimental
Off the driver's side there's... busting about the...
Send a witness to hospital for my acquittal
And my bullets blind you're riding with em would you be dying with you
Killing with the baby face nigga spray the place
Gang member, police got me in their database
Before I drop it in the water get it yay and taste
Bout a quarter banger homie over call it paper way
We don't even speak on the word beef, we let it be
Right back on they ass been a psychopath since seventeen
Nigga ain't no piece on the east street waste
Used to burn shit and the shermsticks my life style

[Hook:]
My life style krazy, Luxury condos and bad hoes Krazy!
Hop out the Porsche Jump up in the lambos Krazy!

Hop out the Porsche up jump in the lambos krazy!
And when the song get pussy niggas get faded
Packing that big clip when shit get krazy!

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Niggas die every day, one day if I'm next
One foot in the condo, one in the projects

Get this income is the outcome
So I'm a finish this work and finish the album
And I know them people got it out for me
End of the day is looking out for me

Bad bitches blowing weed on the balcony

Rest in peace to my enemies
I don't want it if is under a hundred and don't faze me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
105 east bound, feeling like a king real

You're my life style crazy on this play ground
Still hangin with my niggas from the sand box
We on hit it and you know we got them lamb chops
Rock pushin rhymes like wait now
Stack rock bitches ready for the takedown
Krazy I just go no breaks now
My six teens a brick you can't break down
Yeah I'm so solid in this world of mine
Stay on my grind daily I don't really know the time
Watch full of diamonds in my chain dancing
Don't risk don't reach, you don't even chance it
Man down you don't get no second chances
Play haters you need to think about the circumstances

[Hook]

// Stay Down //

Slammin' money all my big homie commissary
Jumped on that ass 65 and take that trip back to Gary
Granny just passed, my uncle 'bout here smoking blast
But I still could fuck babies crib I gots to get to this cash
Forgive me father cause I'm so wrong
But I know through your ghost in my mind been doing it for so long
Been no waddle when working and the lights bizarre we could barely hold on
So I took off that pauldron wake up that york and got my role on
Then I hit myself with reasons little J's and Jesus pieces
Fresh lights and a brand new polo
LP nigga take that logo in the club it's like a ho show
These ho sure often meeting
And the bitches in my past they just didn't know what I could be
Freddie G, hit the booth pick up my penny
And I pimp it like right consistent
And the rugers and the beeper, my ruger my life expanded
For at least 10 more shots should I get going or get gut
But on the other hand I got a burnt hand and then a rubber band on my

[Hook:]
I've been up, baby I've been down
Feels good enough
Baby ain't enough in my town
Gotta get my things right
So I can start the day right
Cause I fucked up
Baby I been fucked round
And it feels good enough
Ain't enough in my town
Shawty get my things right
So I can start the day right

We been to corners and caprices
We cut thousand Caddilacs that don't check I'm cashin that
And I'm chocking smoking on that gasoline
And also huff back on my hoopdie
But my feet just got petite
Had a dream that I would get rich and famous all up on this rapping shit
And the older niggas laughing me I'm a gonna make it happen bitch
And you can't used to write on my raps and dead is the synonym bro
And say my nigga check this I'm gonna check this when I get home
Be lil crazy paper do what I gotta take to make it
Cause enough of these CD's and MP3s
Tryna to shake these haters
Plus I slanging just to maintain the gimmick investigation
Every year niggas only fear the face cases
Living in this industry ghetto please come with smiley faces
But I feel like fuck all these rappers they up on no altercation
Baby face gangster I earn my stripes out on the devil's playground
Peace to all my real niggas that stay down

[Hook x2]

// Boxframe Cadillac ('83 Deville Mix) //

[Hook x2: Z-Ro]
Even if it's raining I'm a still drop the top
That's some other silly shit niggas do when they have the time
Homie we don't give a damn we rolling we ain't tryin' to stop
Most likely we in a foreign but dogging it like it's a Boxframe Cadillac

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
As I maintain from lane to lane
Whip wetter than a lake on fresh paint
Cutless with candy cane
Niggas run up on the cane and get stained
Back 90 melted brain
Clique got his ass dancing with every color on everything
Police on my dick so I dip off in a different car
Stick some cutie Kansas I got workers off in Wichita
State to State like burn had the mask check the murder rate
Nigga on my chain ain't got the nuts to catch a murder case
Made this fate, I got somebody's under this Gucci buckle
Them G.I. mafia your family nigga reach out and touch you
All the way from the East Side to Ivy now all my niggas mayor
Queens but no dramas so catch these hollas or catch the fare
Rolling solo yolo not calling coppers and bread
Homie so goin' off this dope then I pass the blunt to my dead homie
They call me Freddie forgiato I don't fuck that vodka
Cop that handy in a minute we bust the bottle

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Today I feel like rolling through the city
So I guess that's what I'm gonna do
Bitch you wanna ride, you gotta be a 20
You betta' if you a 10 then I don't want you
And I want everybody to see me so I ride so slow
Damn right guess what we all gonna do
44 magnum pack a deck put a cereal bullet hole on you
I knock knock knocking on the truck like Jehovah's witnesses
And I don't even know who bitch this is
But everytime she come up for air she keep sayin'
She wishin' her nigga got a dick this big
Ho you betta' swallow even ass drop
Don't get none of that on my seats
Baby there's a fan on my bed with pussy and titties
And ass can't compete
And there's something about when I drop my top
It's like bustin' a nut
And watch out the motherfucker run up with the bullshit
I'm a beat 'em up and I'm a spill my guts
Homie I'm running on mayonnaise and mustard
The 60th loop till the interstate
Which one that don't matter add one of them motherfuckers
Cause they can all take us to get the cake
I remember my first car Canary yellow Cutlass
With the brown door to drive by mobile
I was eating and sleeping and living in
I woulda traded a mattress for my mobile
But nowadays when all change just a couple of stacks
Folks gave me and in the middle of falls gate highs
And in the front big falls gate in the back

[Hook x2]

// Middle Of The Night //

[Hook: Wayne Blazed (Freddie Gibbs)]
In the middle, in the middle of the night
Why you laying down sleeping
I'm a wake you up with it, in the middle of the night
Baby I ain't trying to hold you
I just wanna bend it over, in the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)
In the middle of the night
(What you wanna do, how you wanna do it)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]

Snowbunny bitches in the kitchen, and they go for it
They only fuck with rappers, ballers and them dopeboys
And I'm the type of nigga to hit you with the dope there
So bring your friend, I brought my partner, that's a dope ship
If you with pimping nothing worser than a broke bitch
Leave that pussy standing in the cold, that's some cold shit

[Hook]

// On Me //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Rollin, pockets on bruise bruise by Louken
Coming from colors like fruit loops remove goose
Hoes right behind me in 2 groups they too loose
Balling on me running through niggas bitches that shoot loops cruise
Not even magic blue or Shaq feet
Back like the bitch ran track ass like athletes
Quite up in the peace so wait on that pass me
Finally got that ass bitch, striptease be last week
I guess I got the dick so I make the rules
When they let the mothernigga play the rules
Strapped up motherfucker better play cool
Even H57 that's my favorite tune
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch
I'm a fool dog ass nigga
So go play with your kids I'm a grown ass nigga bitch

[Hook:]

Said I put it on me

[Verse 2: Problem]
Compton California that's where I'm from
Fuck your girl pussy until it's numb

Fake a state hate long as real niggas recognize

Taking care of my day ones and feeding on my wolf
2 3 6 fives ago I was live you know
Yeah I got off more tree than woods
Nigga it's the real, ace of spades a deal
It ain't what you say it's how you say what you feel
I do it from the chest I reek of success
You ain't seen a nigga this cold out the West in a long time
Boy say you wanna problem it's a long line
Super hot boy push a cold line
Shawty starring at a gold mine
I'm on now, showtime

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
We smoking OG

We chopping the whole key
I slap it on a fire he slap it on a G
But yo that's still my folks be close since '93
Money over bitches running with my niggas
Hooting with the squad the robbers and dope dealers
Without these permissions I'm German the cold killers
Open on the streets don't got mercy on broke niggas
I'm thugging to the east bay and my nigga jack of 7
I'm on the freeway I need another pack of that
You know how beef lay hit a lick flip the zippers
I told the girl I'm just the type of nigga
Got my killer from the east bay
Hit the lay I got some weight to the 8th tray
You broke it down I hit my money at the next day
Hit a liquor flip the zippers
Told my girl I'm just the type of nigga

[Hook]

// Tell A Friend //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Thug nigga til the end tell a friend bitch
Won't change for no paper plus I been rich
Yeah, shout out to the East New York

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I've been on my grind, but the dope price is so high
Put my brother through college off this ski mask shit
Told him while he was in class I'm with smokers lighting up glass dicks
My white girl in the 'burbs she like to shoot up
Escaping the perfect life in the apparent way she grew up
I thought that our only mission on earth was getting our loot up
But in the pursuit of happiness parasites could pollute us
Hard times part time jobs can't pay my
Gas bill light bill niggas wanna take mine
Life in the streets over gold and chrome feet
Police looking but I'm cooking ducking bullets all week
Got a freak I bag my dope at her apartment
Fight and got hot cause her baby daddy like to start shit
Knowing the whips get spray Mac-11, AK
I'm spittin on your grave 'cause my grand mama raised a thug nigga, bitch

[Hook: Jay-Z]
Thug nigga til the end tell a friend bitch
Won't change for no paper plus I been rich

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Lord forgive em, he got them dark forces in em
Front lawn got Porsches parked in it
On it rimmed it up, this is the business of owners
Lifers, loners, rolling cones on the cover of the rolling stone good morning
Toke up as soon as we woke up, kurb check my low rider
And I spring my spokes up so I'm in the leisure so folk
Sixty lexes on the set of loafers
Smashing all them cockroaches on the corner
Stomp a mud hole in the big bitch look at me kodak moment
Smoking one for Pimp C send Bun B a tweet
Telling me and Gangsta Gibbs will be in Texas next week
Tell a man with the plants bring a bag to the suite
I got a plan to get this cash homes this nigga be sweet
Got a cam in my motor then ran niggas over
To get to that paper I'm sure you friends done told you

// My Nigga //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Stay by the whipper
Through the pillow how I deliver
Almighty moving this mafia godfather figure
Price is on me couple of dollars gonna put me in the dirt
Fuck these suckers I bet these backwoods kill me first
Pulling these bitches and hit reverse we out the sidewalk
Fully immersed and money in murder can't take my mind off
My homie John Will call the case so we took some time off
Feds is infiltrating the front gotta shut the grind off
Hit me and lick it hit the switch tryna to flip this shit legit
Go Gabbanas at the zaza I fucking my Texas bitch
Baby mamas, girls, wives of ball players wanna ride with us
We all sinners, but God save us from these times my nigga
I'm down to grind with you and go out like a man
I can't lay down to die with you
Sacrifice my education for watching chains and bracelets
And I seen more funerals than graduations
We're living life the fast way time racing pass me
Down to be a problem since the day my mama had me
Judge throw some time but I just smile take it gladly
Wood on my dash with the gas in my ashtray

[Hook:]
I just wanna ride and survive my nigga
And make it through these times ride or die my nigga
I just ride and survive my nigga
And make it through these times ride or die my nigga
I just ride and survive my nigga
And make it through these times ride or die my nigga
I just ride and survive my nigga, my nigga
And make it through these times ride or die my nigga

[Verse 2: Hit]
All my niggas real niggas I got beef till them boys
Ready to kill niggas rolex D with their heat
Ready to peel niggas hit your street anybody sleep
They decease when we creep sweeping cowards off their feet
No one died niggas come on listen let's get high nigga
Ride nigga come fuck my ho man I'm too tired nigga
Mean niggas bout our green niggas
Home team first to run upon the scenes nigga
Clean niggas, Louie V better to tea
Sipping lean niggas MOB my team strictly 'bout their cream nigga
No love for the lame niggas, big chain niggas gang bang niggas
Came from living life the fast way time racing pass me
Niggas stay on the leak cause I've been out here on my ass man
All night on the corner with my stash in the trash can
Vesting weather you young niggas is blasting
But I just wanna ride

[Verse 3: D-Edge]
And survive for what the law say
Murder and lurking clothes curtains here that's all day
Psychic with the paper I listen to what my palm say
Gotta get real acquainted with my buck the sun spray
For the pray and these vultures gotta pay attention
Of the way these niggas move cause you never knew what they thinking off
Way of from you punished the victim or be the victim of
So you force to choose what side of the street you living on
Trying to test tray you flow just like a life jacket
Ask all these jackals on life because they life lacking
The government only give us help and life rations
They don't really care about us RIP to Mike Jackson
I play myself in this movie your lights on light action
Glock gunned and the findy belt that's my fashion
Purp twisting the brown leap that's my passion
Inhale pine to God give me a sign and just

[Hook]

[Verse 4: G-Wiz]
While I smoking on the wild pack
Reminiscing the scenes I committed a while back
Cause as a kid I was forced to run with a wild pack
You can't survive in the jungle unless you 'bout that
I just react when I'm caught in this sticky situation
His body language was showing sings of infiltration
The Lord forgive me I'm praying that you hear me
I'm having nightmares that the devil is out to get me
So stay with me through these try times
To live or die in G.I. I walk a fine line
Cause I see death around the corner
That's why I keep the chopper closer
He ain't constantly looking over my shoulder
These niggas bogus failed
And you a target once they found out your holding benz
A piece of harmony is a myth it ain't no holding hands
Their system don't understand I gotta overstand
But in the mean time I'm gangsta' leaning in my rover and I

[Hook]

// Seventeen //

[Intro:]
I'm from the lights
I'm the village dream
When I was seventeen
(Guess the dream is true hah?)

[Young Jeezy:]
Uh yea wussup?
It's the world baby
Uh yea wussup?
It's the world baby

[Hook:]
I was on my grind when I was 17
Only half a thing for a stack worth of 17
Took a road trip, came back, have me 7 nins
When I turn 18, I'm worried by 7 things

Yea, look, take 'em back when I was 17
17, I had a cutlass it was hella clean
Always thuggin', always on the scene
It's the word it's 2 to bat, need some bigger chings

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I gotta get it, I want, I gotta have it
Throw the nuts in the bag then I'm right back at it
Yea, 14 grams in my attic
The dealer of the year, so who's really the addict
Yea, all this fast money I'm a get done
She kick me out the house, I got a dick that dance
Guess mama don't love me no more
See, she might not even let me use the oven no more
1-35, fresh out the press, smell the aroma
Walk the stick, my uncle on the couch, she in a coma
And I swear that sin is louder than an avalanche
Came back to X the 50, did the hammer dance
My grandma keep telling me I needs to help
But I keep tellin' her that I need some wealth
Cutlass with the alpine, got there too long
Blow wind a hard, bitch I got me 2 chicks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
At 17 I had a 9 with 17 shots
East 17, 5-17 block
Fraid it's to the left, whole hood cling lower
Shout my niggas from valley Bronx to Concord
Nigga, you could play ball
Class, I took the day off
Tryna buy some new J's, hopin' I get the skate off
Fully automatic shootouts, call that sprayer
Before I ever see 17, I bust the K off
And my homie got me blowed in the worst way
7 grand for 17 birthday
In the school hall we was getting cheddar there
Except the T hundred in my letter man
When I was 17

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slick Pulla]
17, you bust a clean team
Uppin' in this food court, polo'd up, pullin' everything
Some lil niggas 'bout their fra skins
Got my first queue key 5 points from the advocates
Head 'em down, I'm still fat there
Had 'em stashed in the old spice camp, thought I was slick there
Diner with the ho when all goin' cho
Went from halfbacks to four ways a glass
In it with the black vans and the tats
Now we drinkin' milk, throwin' up slaps
Young and wild, chest all full of cash
Just a little nigga tryna come up on some green bats

[Hook]

// Every City //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
If you ain't fucking get the fuck out
Had a twelve pack of rubber 'bout to run out
Back seat got 'em toes on my windows
I was gone off the lean so my bitch goes
And every time a nigga drive it's a do you why
Smoking in the S5 I be speeding by
Get the pussy on accident I don't even try
She ain't sucking some later then I leave at night
Got a little freak in lemonade the severed sr bimmer
Everytime she come around niggas tag team her
Free clothes, elbows out the tower roof
You a rookie keep the pussy if you got dough
If we run the same street we might've fucked the same bitch
Made a buster hoping now hope it wasn't your main bitch
I'm about a dollar a broke course the main bitch
Y'all I'm 'bout to fuck 'em but chick stay in your lane bitch

[Hook: YG]
I got a bitch in Atlanta, a bitch in LA
A bitch in Miami, a bitch in the Bay
I got a bitch she cook steak I met her on tour
And all the bitch wet is question me and
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city
I got a bitch in every city yeah
I got a bitch in every city
And all we ever do is fuck

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Ye bank roll, stunting on these fake hoes
Murder one I beat the pussy nigga case closed
He ain't shit to get your neck froze
Kick the squares off bus take the rest home
Straight like that get straight to it
And I'm all to fucking and the coughing I can't do it
I hear these niggas talking about fame but they ain't moving
You hit me with some brain I watch my chain stupid
I'm a dog, dog ass nigga
Your boyfriend triggered you can call that nigga
I heard you got some brans spending all that with ya
Got some weed and some liquor get the pitcher baby I just wanna hit ya

[Hook]
