// The Real G Money //

As these drugs alter my heartbeat
Ain't been taking my medication, don't get me started, G
Hustling, jacking, murder, and macking been such a part of me
Such an evil seed, wonder what will my son or daughter be?
Killers
I'm too crazy, ain't fit to raise 'em
Streets might send yo daddy off on vacation or early grave him
Asked my pastor, is there some special place in heaven for gangsters?
In the eighth grade I was selling eight-balls off that pager, put it on my nation
I'm done living out my shoebox
Crack rock cooking on two pots
Came up in the school of the ski mask
Where you quick to make a punk bitch move out
I'm raised way deep on the east side
Right next to the Dorie Miller projects
GDs, Vice Lords on the same set
Wear ya hat the wrong way, you get popped at
And I got a hundred round drum on the AK
Killed a nigga and his homeboy the same day
Now I'm looking for the third motherfucker cause I burn motherfuckers in the rap game same way
And the label never gave no fucks
Tell 'em only thing that dropped was these nuts
Thinking that I'm playing with niggas cuz I don't cater to niggas
I just be taking from niggas and I be waiting for niggas to get

[Hook:]
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water
Cause I woke up, lit my smoke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world

If you gangsta and you know a nigga stacking bands
Whether you knee-deep in them kilos or you sacking grams
This life we live, man, it's so cutthroat make you clap your friends
No ambulance, they just took their bodies in matching vans
Please call the coroner, left some trash on my corner, bruh
I was on tour for the summer, every bitch I fucked was a foreigner
And your bitch was a bust it, met the whole click, fucked, and recorded her
Got some top at the Marriot, dropped her off in the morning
Girl, my morning cup of coffee is a double cup of syrup
Don't take orders from no nigga, fuck your boss and fuck the world
And I'm good in every hood, don't need no passes or referral
Me and crack go way back like starter caps and jheri curls
Whip it girl

[Bridge x2:]
From a G to a kilo
To a mill from a motherfucking zero
4-5 when I look through the peephole
Nigga, I'm the real G Money, no Nino

[Hook]

// Came Up //

I woke up and wrote this for my hater, mane
Forgis on that thing with a four fifty four, I'll see you later, mane
Bitches gonna bop, tell 'em pop that pussy for this paper, mane
Ho just wanna kick it, so I backseat Escalade her, mane
Thugging, and if you with me then you do the same
Got some partners doing life for the thing we do for this change
Tried the rap shit cause my big homie told me switch up my lane
Nigga, this trap shit get you stuck in a grave or locked in a cage, mane
Yeah, I put my ski mask on and fucking came up, came up
Staying on this thug shit, bitch, I fuck the game up, game up

Dumping hollow tips for my enemies like yeah
Fuck you pussy boys in this industry like yeah
Fuck the records, I'm knee deep in the streets
New white girl on my phone, keep the Nikes up on my niece's feet like yeah

[Hook x2:]
I jumped off in the streets and fucking came up
Forgis on everything, I fuck the game up
Woke up and wrote this for my fucking haters
That hate the way a nigga came up

Uh came up, I'm never coming down
Nigga ain't have shit, sat the bench, now bitch I run the town
Heard niggas in the street want me hit, heard I can't come around
Nigga stepped all through your event, yeah bitch I shut it down
Thugging, and if you with me you'd be on a job
Private party, fifty freaks in a suite for me and my squad
Me and my partners, Gary, deep in the streets, less than a mob
Had a chopper thing, go beat down your block and then beat the cops, mane
Yeah, I stepped off in the booth and fucking came up, came up
Every tape I drop made these little niggas step they game up, game up
Nigga heard Young Gibbs, now it seem his flow done changed up, changed up
But I don't give no fuck, little nigga, my dues been paid

Got white girl on my phone nigga, whip it up if you feeling me like yeah

[Hook x2]

// Hundred Thousand //

[Hook: G-Wiz]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of cocaine
Niggas'll kill you in these fucking streets
Each and every day I duck the feds, man
Trying keep my baby something to eat
Down to my last, 'bout a quarter thing
Ain't no love in these dope streets
Ain't trying to be the man, just trying to maintain
I swear, this game gon' be the death of me

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I swear, this game gon' be the death of me
Fuck niggas in these streets wanna suck my blood and rip my flesh from me
Youngsters trying to air me out and leave my body cold
Sell my dope on Sunday, can't do church, have mercy on my soul
Have caine, Carolina park king
And I came fresh on them Forgis, forty thousand in my jeans
Nigga got back to the flip, ain't gon' let no bitch shit on my dreams
Unadjusted to the mob, stayed on my job, ho what you mean
100K might give me four of those
Have my prices show me those
Hit me in the daylight, if it's late night then my store will close
Seen some niggas overdose
Not only dope, but money and power
Dirty dancing with the fucking devil in my darkest hour
What you know about it

[Hook: G-Wiz]

[Verse 2: Hit Skrewface]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of cocaine
Make it stain, slanging things, knee-deep in the dope game
Police in my rearview cause they think I'm serving white
And they probably right
If they hit them lights, you know I'm swerving right
Now I ain't stopping, them bitches gon' have to catch me
And before I let 'em do that, them bitches gon' have to stretch me
Cause it's do or die, life or death, what you rep, right or left
For the folks, five or the six, or is it on the four
These niggas kill in the streets over gang signs
I heard some niggas wanna murk me cause I got them things flying
But I ain't dying, you ain't fucking with no coward
Dirty dancing with the fucking devil in my darkest hour
What you know about it

[Hook: G-Wiz]

// D.O.A. //

[Hook 1: Freddie Gibbs]

Say these motherfuckers scared to rob a robbing-ass nigga
Send you back to your connect, you short a lot of bands, nigga
Gangsta Gibbs, baby greasier than Weezy at the All-Star

[Verse 2: G-Wiz]
D.O.A., get it how I live it when I let that four go
Naptown nigga, done made it, emerging fresh out the dope smoke
All my niggas hustlers and killers, green light we all go
Send 'em all to they makers and close casket they funerals
No smiling, came up out a dirty alley with the thugs
Banging TECs and repping sets, young connoisseurs with them drugs
Pack the baggage, flip the cabbage, keep it slamming every day
How the fuck niggas talking bout R.I.P. when boy you 'bout to
D.O.A. yourself

[Verse 3: Big Kill]
Bang bang bang, gang bang is all I fucking know
Blazing rocks with killers and some motherfucking cutthroats
And I know Colombians that bring it by the fucking boat
Clap they ass, put they ass face down on the fucking floor
Hit a couple corners and nigga know I got the blow
Hit a couple corners now and nigga know I got the store
Riding down Grant Boulevard, pulling out the four
On my way to Ham Block, figure cause I'm on dope
Kill

[Pre-Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

[Hook 2: Freddie Gibbs]

// Lay It Down //

Lay it down, bitch
Bitch, lay it down
Straight to the cake

Boy, don't make a sound

Case full of weight
Thug nigga 'bout my peso
All-black with the strap
Cup full of Ac
Y'all niggas sip that Karo
I'm blowed than a motherfucker
Million dollars in, bitch I'm on like a motherfucker
Smoking strong like a motherfucker
Vice Lord, Folk, Black Stones in this motherfucker

// I Seen A Man Die //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Ten bullets in his ass, hit the gas
Ten deep on enemy turf, me and the homies 'bout to mash
Where that glass? Glock was plastic, smoking that gas, puff with the fastest
Bitch get wilding, Gangsta Island, Gary
Smiling in my casket with my eyes wide open
I'ma make my enemy look me straight in my face before they closing
I'ma pierce right through his soul and take control of his emotions
Let it haunt you in your dreams
Bitch kill you, kiss your mama, just like Bishop did Raheem
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
Over a Georgetown Starter jacket and some new Jordan 5s
Blessed in this shit, blessed in this shit, question is, will I survive?
Laid out with a hot gun smoking, on his own blood choking, Gangsta Gibbs, bitch

[Hook x3: Freddie Gibbs and Lil' Sodi]
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
(Gotta live my life)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Eight, nine geekers, make 'em fiend for a piece of crack
Got ten, eleven youngsters in my kitchen, watch me teach 'em that
You call that reaching back? You call that building up?
Fried bologna and a cracker, that was the meal for us
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I, born and die a sinner, but
Blessings over bullets, I pray the Lord deliver
Gibbs, I'm gangbanging, caine slanging

[Hook x3]

Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact

[Outro: Lil' Sodi]
Lil' Sodi, Gangsta Gibbs, ESGN nigga
Real niggas
Fucked with him since day one, nigga
Gangsta Gibbs
Living our life in this cold world, nigga
Take a slug, and still at this shit, nigga
You already know, Lil' Sodi
All the neighbors know, L.A
Gibbs, love you 'til the end, nigga
You my bro
You already know
Love you homie

// Have U Seen Her //

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?
I got dope in my two-liter
Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers
Just a young nigga 'bout my mail
Steady tryna work this yayo
Summertime, can't do jail
Money in the safe make bail
Got these pussy ass niggas might tell
Pussy ass niggas might hate
Spoonfeed niggas, no way
Bring it on down, we straight

Dope house full of geekers
Heroin for your needle
All-white cocaina

Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 2: Skrewface]
I got pounds of keisha
Keys of the coca
Voted number one D-Boy by the fiends and the smokers
Dope house full of cluckers and the feds trying to scope us
Still got to get that guap, man fuck the cops, I got that blow
Drank by the pint, what you sipping, nigga pour up
Drugs on deck, I'll never run out, what the fuck is a drought, nigga hold up
Anything you want I got more of

I stay ready for the jack boys, how you want to act boy
Get your little bitch ass tore up
Anything you want I got more of
And I keep that thing cause ain't no love

Dope house full of geekers
And they lined up 'round the corner cause they know my price is cheaper

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

// One Eighty Seven //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah, these are the tales that I tell so well
I hit this new chick named Michelle in my 6-8 Chevelle
And yo, last week it was Michelle, but this week it's Monique
Who had the best, yo, I can't tell, both them hoes was some freaks
That bitch one-eighty-seven, that shit one-eighty-seven
Put me to sleep, got that killer pussy, go call the reverend
Push up the coast, watch her pussy pop in my 9-11
I'm standing tall, got me busting off like a loaded weapon

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
That bitch one-eighty-seven
That bitch one-eighty-seven
That bitch one-eighty-seven
Got that killer pussy, call the reverend

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
That bitch one-eighty-seven, fucked in my '87
Hotbox my Chevy, we posted up for the smoking section
Won't take your chick out to dinner but I eat that bitch for breakfast
Hit her with that dick in the morning, leave all my bitches stressing
Fuck all these acting-ass bitches, ratchet-ass bitches
Sign my name in bloody murder, bitch, I autograph bitches
Know some niggas 'round my way that might spend all the cash with ya
Hope I treat you for a day then drop you with your last nigga
But don't be scared to bust it open for me
Bring that shit back in slow motion for me
Dropping bucket naked for this money
Got all my bitches checking for the money

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
These are the tales that I tell so well
I hit this bitch in A-T-L, she was from Riverdale
She fucked with ballers, I could tell from her hair to her nails
Can't say goodbye, that pussy fye like it was dope on a scale

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 4: Problem]
Watching you swing around the pole'y
While I be taking these shots like Kobe
Just ordered a bottle of cham
Please come ringing around the rosey
Don't bring her around the homies
She thicker than stogies
I eat her like hoagies
Knowing ain't good for me like snitching the police
But I just keep calling that bitch
Pop a band, let it fall in that bitch
Take her home, get dome
Zip then rip there and leave it all in that bitch
I get mad when niggas calling that bitch
Almost had a nigga caught in a twist
Done near lost my girlfriend for that whirlwind start falling and slip
Better back up though
I can't fight, she gon' get it back up though
Killer with the head, call it cutthroat
Bust a nigga head, is it love, no
She come real quick when I fuck slow
Fuck slow, fuck slow, fuck slow
Still licks my butt slow
It's daddy's little slut though

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

// Eastside Moonwalker //

Lifestyles of the insane
Eastside thug nigga, I'm the shit, you a shit stain
I let the boxframe switch lanes
Not a pretty nigga, but I got some game for a bitch brain
And I lay it on so thick
Charge it all to a broad, heard a pimp nigga quote this
And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirty keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep locking
Keep a strap cause the jackboys keep robbing
Got me pulling up slow
Whip another clip and put my pedal to the floor
Slamming Cadillac doors, working wood like a pro
Ass sit on nothing but that leather, whatcha know, how you living, nigga?
Lifestyles of the insane
Roll the kill, pop a pill, crack a seal, I resist pain
Niggas looking for that big stain
Dirt weed, dog food, fye kush, niggas flip 'caine
Think I lost my religion
Stepping on a pack, break 'em off in the kitchen
Chevy topped off with the chrome in the engine
Niggas gotta floss, that's the cost of this pimping, I'ma pull up slow

[Hook:]
I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'mma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow

It's the muddy cup moonwalker, nightstalker
Motherfucking white chalker, might've caught ya
In the streets with your pants down
Tell 'em call the paramedics, nigga man down, ease up
If you thugging, get your Gs up
And never fake, never fraud, never fold, never freeze up
A black mask, black tee'd up
The motherfucking dope game feed us, how you living, nigga?
And rest in peace to my motherfucking homeboy
But hold your tears, he ain't die, he just a fuckboy
You might as well be a dead man in my eyes
2-2-3, sucker-free when I ride
Freddie Kane, Freddie Corleone
Selling things to the smokers in the mobile homes
A pack of backwoods, dirty styrofoam, and a pocket full of stones
And my Cadillac Brougham, I'ma pull up slow

[Hook]

// F.A.M.E. //

[Intro x4:]
Kill, kill, kill
Murder, murder, murder

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Fully auto, my only motto, forever thugging
Chevy on 6s, them Forgiatos ain't ever scrubbing
Watch honeys run through 100 bottles like it was nothing
We leave the club with two foreign models, her and her cousin
Niggas say that we the brand new thug life
Washing dirty money with this mic, I wish it was right
Tell a song, sipping Perignon, fuck a Bud Light
Tony said the world is yours, only if you plug right
My God, when they bury me, pray my casket be solid gold
Funeral packed with a separate section for all my hoes
Most niggas choose it and lose it quickly, but I was chose
Cook it and sell it, my mama smell it up in my clothes
Bet your favorite rapper get extorted for his paycheck
Mask on my skull, they ain't identify my face yet
We sticking suckers up, I hope they sticking to the cheddar
You pussy niggas might be rich but you ain't rich forever

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
And he can go hard, but I'ma go the hardest
Thugging from the start, don't get a nigga started
Came up in the realest, I know the streets starving
You know we with the business, my niggas go retarded
When we ride
When we ride on our enemies
Never hide from our enemies
'Til we ride our enemies
Fully loaded .45 on my enemies

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
I go, ha-ha-hard up on you motherfuckers
Immediately cock it back and spray one of you fucking suckers
You off-brand niggas get down with the punishment
It's D-P-G, Dogg Pound, so who you want it with
Them gangbang niggas is active, capping shit in the active
With them old-school Tommy gun extended clip
I ride around the city in expensive whips
Should've known that them gangster niggas don't trip
Flag swinging, me and Deep nigga, yeah we gangbanging
Bringing down the ashes if you niggas flaming
Aim for your dome, head shots, slug shots
Police put me throughout, 2-1 on my mugshot
Crazy-ass niggas, yeah we insane
Put the pistol in your mouth, blow out your brain
Bail out on eight million dollar bond
Soon as I hit the streets, nigga, it's back on

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: Spice 1]
When I finger fuck my .45
I hit a nigga right between his eyes
Pull out the heat, make him dance, and do the dougie
Before I blow the back of his shit out, it can get ugly
Yes, y'all, I put his cherry pie on the wall
When I ride on my enemies, niggas know it's uncut and raw
Mr. Bossalini, you can try to stand guard
But niggas like me be going Taliban hard
I spit grenades and piss bullets
Eat a bitch nigga for breakfast when I aim and pull it
Doing wonders for this bread, I Pillsbury these motherfuckers
When his doughboy die with the heat, I carry in my clutches
I'm a natural born rider, like my nigga Freddie Gibbs
Steady going hard and riding with steady clips
I been thugging from the beginning, you niggas soft as linen
I wear my black Jordans to match with my MAC-10

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

// Paper //

[Hook x2: YB]
With a mic, bitch, and I'm nice, bitch
Six rings, yeah, I'm on that Mike shit
But I hit her two weeks ago
Sip the drink, hit the reefer smoke
Sip the drink, hit the reefer smoke
Sip the drink, hit the reefer smoke
But I hit her two weeks ago
Sip the drink, hit the reefer smoke

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
On the mic, bitch, and I'm nice, bitch
Six rings, yeah, I'm on that Mike shit
Straight thug, nigga, most of my life spent
Was on that black top working that white, bitch
Shit, it was just 500 for the zip then
Got a plug and my homeboy chipped in
I was gunning, seventeen when I bagged up
Pyrex, work yo mo'fuckin' wrist in
Turnt up to be turnt down
It's what the kush for, let's get burnt down
I've got a muddy cup of that Texas dope
And that good smoke from that Oaktown, bitch
100 pounds of the good, what it cost?
Hit 'em with the ski mask, they get lost
I don't trick on these hoes
But I will pay your broke bitch to back up off me
Drop them drawers, ho, fuck all that talking
House on my neck, I call that balling
True shit, it ain't shit like a new bitch
My old hoes, I don't call that often
Drop them drawers, ho, fuck all that talking
House on my neck, I call that balling
True shit, it ain't shit like a new bitch
Old hoes, I don't call that often

[Hook: YB]

[Verse 2: YB]
I hit her two weeks ago, got head in the Jeep before
Straight bob with this sloppy top, man, this bitch was a freaky ho
Sip the drink, hit the reefer smoke
Hurry up, let me beat it, though
When she ask me to eat it
I told her, take it or leave it, ho
Cause this pimping shit in my bones
Million cash on my mind, bitch
Snowflakes on that stove, dope fiends on my line, bitch
Straight hand to hand, east side, on my land I'm the man
Learned how to chef up them cookies
Gotta let 'em just dry by the fan
We keep that chopped up in plastic
Gotta find a new place to stash it
Once I ran through my pack
Hit the club, balled out like a draft pick
Keep that chopped up in plastic
Gotta find a new place to stash it
Once I ran through my pack
Hit the club, balled out like a draft pick

[Hook: YB]

Oh no, I ain't got Mercedes
Haters out there tryna take me
Pop the trunk or pop a crazy
Like a barber keeping them extra clippers
Drop 'bout eighty, I drive 'em crazy when I deliver
Mind your business we living life and just stacking riches
Picture me rolling on my phone, scrolling through pussy pictures
Pussy nigga, you in the way, so just step aside
You can't swim with these sharks, you drowning all in your pride
We moving with killers in broad day
It's a cold world, keeping them heaters on all day
All day, oh yeah we riding with them clappers
Cause them bitch-ass niggas praying on us heavy like some pastors
And them feds tryna have our phone tapped
Like some dirty-ass water out the faucet, out the trap
Jay Rock, Freddie Gibbs, 'bout to kill it, hide your feelings
If you show your hands then we gunning and you finished

// Dope In My Styrofoam //

Say, bitch don't get too comfortable
Say, bitch don't get too comfortable
Bitch, don't get too comfortable
Never let a bitch get too comfortable
Bitch don't get too comfortable

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
It's mister ho-breaker, dope slanger, dope drinker
Straight hopped up out the coupe, high off that juice, I'm no stranger to this
Getting lit, getting blowed, [?] dipped in gold
Bulls just beat the Lakers in Staples Center [?]
'Bout to go too deep, I ain't fucked her in like two weeks, feel like two months
And ripping pineapple fanta, fired up two blunts
And this cloud of kush I blow set off the smoke alarm
Fuck it, hash nuggets, Gangsta Gibbs, what you smoking on?
Amber wax and anthrax, bitch I keep a Xan pack
Drop one down in my styrofoam, too high, nowhere to land at
Amber wax and anthrax, bitch I stuff them grams fat
Kick dope down on the floor, and that dope check I'm about to cash that

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Said I'm just rolling with the homies, dope in my styrofoam, man
Said I'm just smoking with the homies, roll up another song, man

[Verse 2: G-Wiz]
Just scooped my blood bitch in a blue brougham
Leather feel so soft, these hoes like riding with no shoes on
Pineapple and purple the potion, I'm on that candy sip
All I do is player shit, 100% Versace, bitch
One more nigga on the run with the yellow
Ho fine as fuck, from De Janeiro, but she play with her nose though
And I ain't mad at her, because I stay with my medicine
Self-inflicted sticky weed and codeine in my beverage
Pour up on that ice, hit the lights, on some moody shit
Bitches, dope, and dollars on some Tarantino movie shit
Other people's pussy, still keep a whole lot of it
Gold pack in my wallet, with about a seventh of dope in my pocket
Getting blowed

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: G.I. Fleezy]
Like when you feeling good, cause bitch I feel so right
Like moving out my body, purple paint and fanta got me tight
I introduce you to my life, come take a look inside
Bitch, wipe your feet and wipe me down, bitch we don't play around
I'm [?]
How you stay focused and function, bitch we gon' blaze a pound
So when the last time you heard that, yeah we really made for this
So go and send the word back
Right about now, time to tally up a staple
Got them ready, willing, able
Molly-popping, make 'em get down on the floor with the business
And they live for the getting it
Player, out here with it, and that's me
The real player with a G

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]

// 9mm //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang
Niggas hustle, niggas murder for this dope and cocaine
If I'm out here doing bad, I'm knocking down your door, mane
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my my 9-millimeter go bang
How I take a nigga's life like it's all right, it's so strange
Put your family in the trunk, man, it's a very cold game
Shit, our scene might leave you terrified
That's why my 9-millimeter stay by my bedside
Got partners locked up up-state, some partners on fed time
Shoot first and ask questions later, boy you ain't never dying, ain't never dying

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter go bang

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang
Listen to my 9-millimeter split your brain
Bullets hit you and whistle past you
Bitch niggas and the police harass you
If you came up quick with a flip, hit a motherfucking lick, how long will it last you?
Lord, rinse my soul clean
I start my day off with Ocean Spray and promethazine
Used to roll them stogies, get blowed, and sprinkle shit in my green
Straight thugged out, dubbed out, had yo mama ride in that limousine, that limousine
Nigga fuck all my enemies, bitch I'll see y'all in hell
Better put five bullets in my dome, punk bitch, I bail, all is well
Unzip that package, it's that Cali, we can tell by the smell
Got black ski masks, rob for practice, sell that shit by the barrel
That silence'll make a whisper my sweet 9-millimeter
And I know these police is listening, gotta throw away my Nokia
If you need me then chirp, money, macking, and murder
Black mask, black gloves, black shirt in the day light, bitch I'm out here working

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 3: G.I. Fleezy]
My nigga, we killas, we ready for everything, trained for it all
Play your position, object and identify, when your time is called
No wonder we only gon' do it the G way and kill 'em all
Cause I don't know no other way, and them bitches know my face
So I can't wait, let me get a taste, and I hate
When niggas be actin like hoes, and bitches be actin the [?]
And I don't give a fuck, have to open you up, two to the head and one to the gut
When I'm with my niggas we thinking 'bout crimes, dropping dope out on these lines
Send 'em back up to get the next one, if I got a gun, somebody gon' cry

[Verse 4: G-Wiz]
Yelling bloody murder, froze, eyes closed fo we hit the street
Could it be? Motherfucker tryna play me shyfe off some jealousy
Rapid fire hellishly, meet up with your maker
Know that karma might catch up to me, for what I did to get this paper
Lord forgive me I'm red rum sipping, grim reaper
Drug smoking, magazine loading, straight slamming and scheming
Block boy, with a short barrel that'll leave a nigga leaking
Eyes on the muddy sparrow 'til we eating, it's the season to let it rain

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]

// Lose Control //

[Hook:]
It really ain't no pressure, baby. I'll take you where there's good weather, baby.
What you think about letting go, letting go? Girl, lose control. [x2]

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, tell me what you know about it
Fell asleep in the projects and woke up on an island
I'm ice cold where the gold pieces are the deposit
That baby face with a killer body, she bout it bout it
And if I play my cards right she might stay
I'm tryin to work on treatin you the right way
I hope you forgive me for all the bullshit cause ain't nobody else in the world I'd rather go through it with

I got plenty g's, Bentley keys, s'all you. Girl, let's stop the fighting. Pick a mall and we can ball through. [x2]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, I just wanna make her feel good
She workin and wheelin, I'm twistin up the wood
Sleep at night and early mornin we gettin to it
Wake up somewhere we ain't never seen where the sea of blue is
Lately I've been thinkin bout, growin up cause I could lose her if I fuck around.
I'm fuckin up, I go from state to state and town to town. But in the end I need a real one to hold me down
So hold me down

I got plenty G's, Bentley keys, all you. That don't mean a thing if I don't got you to come home to. [x2]

It really ain't no pressure, baby. I'll take you where there's good weather, baby.
What you think about letting go, letting go? Girl, lose control. [x2]

I'm so happy that you're the only one. Could have been anywhere we end cause, row but you need me

[Hook]

// Freddie Soprano //

Shitting on niggas, my raps is laxative
Good killer, dope in my bloodstream, that's just how I live
Good killer, dope in my bloodstream, that's just how I'm dying
Before I go, pounds of kush and powder, that's all I'm buying
Started below motherfucking zero
First check that I got from rap
Man I raised my 'Lac and copped a kilo
Since then I ain't been back, straight transactions with my niggas
Few times your boy fell off
But I jumped right back on with the quickness
Freddie Willis to Freddie McClane, yippee ki-yay motherfuckers
I yelled out, Chichi, get that heron and that yay, motherfucker
We yelling fuck the world until it's over
I'm only halfway through my movie, ready to war with Sosa
Where my toaster? I got the breakfast for these niggas
Bitches, strudel their noodles
Snatch their hearts out like a Pop Tart
You're losing, we're moving through you
I'm the smoothest nigga doing this from L.A. to Philly
I feel like Kobe doing work, I just might tear my Achilles
If I don't take a load off, can't, gotta get this blow off
Bustas thought I would show up at his door
Told 'em knock the store off
Renovate these niggas' houses over quarters and ounces
I copped that Polo selling dolo, never had no allowance
That's on my mama, my mama know it
Some months electric, gas and water, we couldn't afford it
I'm soda whipping, yola stretching, hot water boiling
Fuck the police, cause if they catch us, straight to the toilets
And all my gangsta niggas know it

[Hook:]
Nigga, test me, I'll send my some bullets with my reply
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
A nigga diss me, I'll send my some bullets with my reply
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die
I'm straight for life, all I gotta do is stay back and die

Dropping this pill in a cup of dope
Man, just take a breather, rappers is having seizures and strokes
Yeah, that type of shit make niggas sit back and stick to the smoke
Nigga dead before his thirties, an overdose ain't no joke
I ain't one for slacking on my habits
I brush my teeth with Hennessy, sleep with my automatic
My nigga hit my line, he 'bout to touch down with that package
I know the whole house is funky when they rip the package
Everlasting, headed for hell or the jail cell
Won't be a monkey for them crackers like I'm LL
So fuck a Cool J cookie, it's shrimp and lobster tail
I've got two dykes that'll throw a bike out in Lauderdale
All is well when I bail
Working that scale through the day and the night
This V and this L that I throw up don't stand for "Vampire Life"
So sorry Mr. Jones, twisting your fingers can get you gone
Shout out to the Lords, shout to the Folks, word to the Stones
Bitch I'm from where niggas don't survive
A real OG, I ain't start banging at twenty-five
Exotic taste, got exotic bitches, exotic rides
You just a neutron nigga, go work a 9-5
A 9-5 got my college girl to take a trip
Now she think she a gangster bitch
Said I'm the coldest nigga to spit this gangster shit since Jadakiss
Niggas can't go like Freddie Soprano, that's on the mob
Jeezy wrote me off, he traded the trapping for office jobs
But it's cool, nigga
Got my own plate, you can't feed me with your spoon, nigga
Get your paper, I'll let your partners play the fool, nigga
The real realest nigga in it
Way, way back I kept that strap with Lil' Rob in his Infiniti
Told me if I tried this rap, I'd be a legend 'fore I finish
Gangster G.I., what's the motherfucking business?
Nigga, he told me if I tried this rap, I'd be a legend 'fore I finish
Gangster G.I., what's the motherfucking business?
Nigga, we hit 'em up

[Hook]
