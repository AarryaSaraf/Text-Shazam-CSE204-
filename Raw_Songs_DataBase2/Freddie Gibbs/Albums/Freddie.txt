Strippin' lots a pasta like a mobster, I make truffle that
Got a quarter milli in my trunk, underneath the duffle that
Duffle that, where my duffle at?
In the sewer choppin' up them rats, where piranhas at

Pushin' weight, flippin' paper plates
In love with the paper, took my money on a date
She let me hit, I bring that pussy back to home base
My foreign bitches flew in town to Californicate
Wait, uh, psycho off of 17 from Norman Bates
We gangbangin', all you neutral niggas can't relate
I turn that bando to a dope house, bitch, I renovate
I hit the party and whip that white girl to vanilla shake
Believe her, off the bitch, I take a nigga spot like Willie Beamen
Kitty, kitty, fuck a Hellcat, I got the Demon
Used to smoke a stogie with Alexys in the Beamer

Got that Afghani dope with the mob ties
Pop the Glock at yo top, throw the Glock away
Beat the cake just like Ikey beat Anna Mae
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga, but white shit and yellow tape
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga, but knuckles and hollow tips
I just put my monkey nuts on my chopper stick
Might just knock of an arm that chopper hits
From my cuz in the pack and he just lost a brick
Cut that nigga off like he a naggin' bitch
Got my house and whip and your bitch
And this drip on my neck and my wrist off that powder shit

Benz fully automatic
Chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic

Gang gang got it tatted
Set name got it tatted
Yayo got me fuckin' with the matics
Finna wrap this crack up in the plastic
Send your bitch to shop in London
7 hour flight the ho ain't bring no baggage
Street sweeper got a heat seeker
Push a pussy nigga off the planet (on god)
Oh God, show you niggas how to rob
I can shoot a nigga in the face and make the bond
Knock him out his Louboutins
Over 500 degrees when I cook a nigga
Fuck polices I go on the run 'fore I just let 'em book a nigga
Cop that new GTR or Porsche
That's the garage on you pussy niggas

Benz fully automatic
Chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic
You can wife the ho 'cause I done had it
