Album: Fetti

// Location Remote //

[Curren$y:]
Yeah

East side, laboratory coats, testing the dope
I'm in a location remote, Ivory Coast
Tryna get high as I can go, the glass ceiling broke
It's never over, sole controller, all our chains golder
Diamonds brighter, you ain't gotta ask whose live-r
Niggas dyin' to be like us, losin' they minds tryin'
I'm in the basement scrapin' blades with all my sharpenin' irons
'Cause in times of peace that's when these snake niggas creep
You think you safe cause you deep, your goonies half sleep
Stooges if you ask me
Gibbs and Andretti fill that vault full of fetti

Andretti and Gibbs that's like that barrel to your rib
It's that fucking real (Yup)

[Freddie Gibbs (Curren$y):]
Yeah
(Eastside)
Eastside, nigga fuck the peace sign
Yeah, yeah

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Ayy yo
Call the chiropractor this necklace is extra heavy on me
1963 Gold Ds, I went Andretti on it
Dipped the shoes in 24 karats and dropped a Chevy on it
Boss, fuck a franchise tag, niggas can't Le'Veon me
Yeah, 'cause of a bitch I had to sit the bench

L train blessed me you broke me off when I hit the bricks
Passing off the dog bitch I scored the dope and I get assist
Kidnapping IG trapping might get your sister hit
We taping mamas up, we filling them llamas up
Niggas making statements they Manafort Papadopoulos
Trump sweating bullets on Diet Coke sniffing powder up
And if he build the wall we gon' bring that dope underground with us
Told my nigga Spitta your enemies my enemies
I just solar powered up the Model X
A real nigga keep the same energy, like what
I wrap the pack like I'm Stunnaman

Legend in this bitch, might do Coachella as a hologram, nigga

That is just exactly what they want you to believe
Let's just call it the phenomena
He outranks them
He, he outranks them
Sit down
I don't wanna sit, I want my money

// The Blow //

Yeah, yeah
Nigga just, you know what I'm sayin', the king of, you know
King of talkin' shit
Yeah, yeah
(You don't know how far, you don't know how much, you don't go, when you fuckin' with the blow)
Yeah, we goin'
Yeah, yeah yeah

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Choppa style, chop chop, choppa style

Shout to Ghazi, Arabic numbers in my Rollie dial

My baby said if I be faithful, she gone hold me down (Real shit)
I'm fuckin' these hoes, I want it all like an only child
About to take a trip, I got coke and dope on my grocery list
Oxycontin pack, I be switchin' rackets like Djokovic

Stood up on my demon, the machine ain't never promoted this
Coldest nigga you ever heard on Alan or Otis shit

(And you know this shit)
Bitch, it's liquid golden when I'm over shit (Yeah)
I fill up the track like a Mr. T starter kit, spit the hardest shit
I should grow a motherfuckin' mohawk and get a black van with a red stripe

Nigga say I got 'em for his weight, I shot him in his face
That pussy boy was dead right (Dead right)
It's just a freestyle, let a nigga breathe
I don't know what's worse
To have the IRS or have your baby mamas in a nigga's cheese

Had to cut a couple bitches off
I guess they used to think that they was out a nigga league
Ghostface, I got ice cream
Russian, Puerto Rican, Black and Blackanese

[Curren$y:]
You don't know how far
That shit easier than writing
You can go, how much
Federal photographers
You can grow, how far
I don't know why the fuck I wanted to say that, shit
You can go, when you fuckin' with the blow

From a seven hundred square foot apartment
Never claim to be the king of New Orleans
Though my new castle one of the largest
From helicopters, federal photographers takin' pictures
My driveway full of Impalas and I'm not stoppin' for one minute
If they really thought they knew somethin'
They would've been came to come get me
Not sayin' that they would've got me, though
You copy, bro, I'm out at Mojave
Desert, dune-buggies and Kawasakis
You gotta know to have fun with your money
Young hustler, watch me
Keep hittas around me
'Cause niggas be clownin', can't trust nobody
It might be your partner that drop your body
That shit not shockin'
I see it all the time, livin' in this wild world of crime
Scribblin' lines on her mirror
Bitches nose dive, who am I

You don't know how far
You can go, how much you can grow, how far
You can go, when you fuckin' with the blow

You mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke?
Well, I always wanted to try, you know
But you want to, right? Why not?
It's great stuff, Alvy
A friend of mine just brought it over from California

// New Thangs //

[Documentary & Curren$y:]
The white girl is Donna, another prostitute
In five years she has had five pimps
She now operates without one
I'm makin' good around love affair, and I done
Employ 'em for love affair
That's what they love, like
Everybody wants love (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And a pimp isn't going to go like that
As soon as another younger, cuter girl comes along that can make more money
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dada-da, dada-da, dada-da, dada, da)
I'm going after her
I can't stand
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Curren$y:]
Uh, white and yellow Air Max as I step out my 'Lac
Plus I smell like a pack, little cologne mixed with that
My partners always strapped, I don't be on all that
They be wherever I'm at because they know how y'all act
I pulled up in a what's this, I came back in a what's that
A little switch up move and that's a stunt double pack
They talk but never attack, I walk with God I'm relaxed
I got a Rollie collection, you duckin' bill collectors
(Gone take you to that next level)
You niggas always stressin'
I'm in a suite in a Westin in a notebook sketchin'
New designs for the season, fashion week we gonna sneak 'em
Yeah

Dada-da, dada-da, dada
Dada-da, dada-da, dada
Dada-da, dada-da, dada

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yeah, yeah
Rockin' Virgil Air Max, Off-White cook crack
I got the razor blade and clippers you get your shit pushed back
I turned some shit into sugarcane a nigga couldn't look back
I can't evade these gangsta ways, I guess the hood did that
One pair of shoes now I got everything to lose
Virginia street blues
Your credit score fucked up in the set, ain't paid your street dues
Pussy ass nigga
Runnin' around with a motherfuckin' pack like you ain't
Like you did that shit before the Kane nigga, Kane train bitch
You niggas always stressin', I'm at a suite at the Westin
Fucked at the Waldorf Astoria with Alicia and Gloria
I promise every bitch I fucked in 2018 was a foreigner
Dead homies in my wall, I zip 'em up like the coroner
And you can passport stamp it, Mulsanne or black Maybach it
But I still twist up in that Chevy or that Lac god damn it
And you can passport stamp it, Mulsanne or black Maybach it
But I still twist up in that Chevy or that Lac god damn it
It's Gangsta Kane

// Saturday Night Special //

[Curren$y:]
Gold thangs on a bar of soap
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eastside
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ladada-dada, dada, dada
Uh, yeah

And that Rolls Royce float
Clean, like I put a set of gold things on a bar of soap
Within every bar another motivational quote
While these niggas going through phases
I never mutated or deviated from the life or mission statement
This is preservation of the vibe
Never let them forget the time
Well they say you was a rapper
You fasho had to know how to rhyme
I keep my passport close, 'cause it eases my mind
(Eases my mind)

It's a shame what they did to it
Now the rap just don't go that same route
When they take rawness away, just
Just they make it too pretty

I'm feelin' trapped on this revolvin' land mine
That could blow at any minute
Saturday night special with one bullet in the chamber
And six cylinders spinnin'
Russian Roulette, the American Dream could be your death
Or it could be everything

[Freddie Gibbs:]
It's M.O.B. everything
Back in '03 had Gucci seats, I put Gs on everything
Made matrimony with this game
I got cocaine wedding rings
Them niggas taxin' for the nina
They want like ten and some change
I got my tears and my pain
I got my balls and my girl
And I ain't breakin' that shit for a nigga or bitch
That shit is absurd
I'm controversial with these verbs
Like Christopher Wallace with words

Felix Mitchell with birds

Malcolm X with the perm

Nigga

Freddie Gibbs; I heard the name, but I didn't know
Like, I didn't know how good he was
It was after the photoshoot
After I had already shook hands with him and met him
I told him this when I seen him again, too, out in LA
I was like, yo, I was like, yo, I ain't even know, like, you really good

Yeah
Bitch hit my line said she wanna go eat and drink and smoke and shit (Goofy bitch)
Before I hung up, I said call me when you want some dick
(Want some dick)
I'll never go broke in this game
I'll charge it on a bitch (Charge it on a bitch)
So, my family and my kids will never want for shit
Stuck in a cell with no windows but I got a pot to piss
Smokin' that dope on a daily
Fucked up the probation, I gotta go drop some piss
Hop in a truck, and I throw on that Twista
Adrenaline Rush on some mobster shit

Even when niggas was broke
We made it look rich, bitch, I'ma optimist
My presence'll fuck up your confidence
Freaky bitches, I'm they confidant
Trappin' out of muh fuckas rappers, slappin' these Poppadocs
RZA with the zippers, official men chop it off the block
Once I made an M, I ain't give a fuck if I popped or not
And I can't swim, a nigga ain't never had dreams of coppin' yachts
But I kowabunga, servin' that pussy at a thousand knots
Rest in peace to Ruck; tell Jesus I need a billion bucks

Goon with the balloon, ain't no helium, but I sealed him up
Feel the rush

// Now & Later Gators //

[Freddie Gibbs]
Snort somethin'
Do what you do
You know it's alright, baby
All night, baby
Ay, ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Slidin' down on them glass feet like

Yeah, but I don't have time for these hoes, usually (Yeah)
Yeah, I whipped the wet and VVS the jewelry (Yeah)

Pimp like I got now-and-later gators on
Bitches on my phone, you know we can do it all night baby
(All night baby)
You know it's alright baby
Ay, ay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// No Window Tints //

To go, to go, to go, to go
The sounds (Yeah) Just the wind on my skin

[Curren$y:]
Uh, fine fabrics, interior serious
Dash board lavish, 14-Karat gold instruments
I'm outside looking at it, I didn't even sit in it yet
I can't believe that it's just how I envisioned it
Watchin' the speed limits baby, we smokin' weed in it
Without no window tints, to me that make no sense
Can't hide, when you this fly
Them niggas is seeing it
Takin' in this sunset on the lake
While reminiscing on how narrowly I escaped
We divide the cake, brunches with the heads of state
Mimosas on different coasts and these niggas ain't even close
They don't want no smoke
Them niggas broke they wan't hand outs
I'd rather hand 'em a rope
Standing in one place won't get you paid
They fire desperation shots but I'm not fazed

Welcome home
What'd you say your name was?

// Willie Lloyd //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Can't tell me a mothafuckin' thing, bruh

Yeah, straight from hood like
Yeah, hammer dance on the devil's house
Yeah, show them niggas
Told them niggas, I'ma show them niggas, what up
Yeah, told them niggas and I show them niggas, where at
Yeah, told them niggas and I show them niggas, where at
Ugh, yeah

Straight out the sewer like Das EFX
Which one you fuck niggas want it next
In my dreams I see faces of death
I'ma pray for you hoes, get your Rosary, cross your chest
Young Soprano can't fade me like Thanos
I just shipped a whole damn piano up out the west
Hit Chicago, might fuck around ball out like Ralo
And go put 500 thangs on the jet
I just picked up 500 thangs on the strip

Nigga rap with a hundred pack in the Lyft
OG niggas they told me that they still be movin'
That they had the hook up since '96
Black Tony told 'em Chichi get the yay'
Line of scrimmage, Peyton Manning, switch the play

Pour the holy water all up in the Jesus piece
Wash a real nigga's sins away
Yeah, took it from the devil's mouth
I hammer dance on the roof of the devil's house
Chop a dime bag or drum with the metal out
Percocet, weed and codeine brought the devil out
Brought dope in momma house, let the devil in
Dropped a zip, took a loss, ain't gon' never win
I'm so sick of these fuckin' rap groupies
I need to go find some good pussy to settle in
Hit my plug with the strap
Pussy boy wanna jack up the pack, and a nigga can't settle for it
I just hit up the jack
All he do is smoke wet on the steps and a nigga might wet 'em for it
Six figures, most niggas never saw it
Almighty dollar, nigga can't ignore it
Light, gas bill, nigga can't afford it
Put him on that wet and nigga wet 'em for it
Yeah
Fin ball rollin', catch me chuckin' up the vatos locos
Bitch, I run the deck like Willie Lloyd

A nigga got the fans and the feds takin' photos
Know it's A-1 yola, when you see the logo
Made a half a milli off a Motorola
Percy Miller with the baking soda
Silkk the Shocker rock, I got C-Murder motives

I'm a giant, niggas standin' on my shoulders
Gave them niggas game, now they throwin' shade

I know Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Finna load the heatseekers in the gauge
Drugs loaded in me when I hit the stage
And the Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Nigga what
I know Folks, Crips, Bloods, Renegades
Got respect drippin' from a nigga name
Nigga what, yeah
Yeah, Big Lord Bunny Rabbit nigga
Bout to chef a package then it's automatic
Nigga what

// Tapatio //

[Curren$y:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

It's like divin' out the plane
Once that music hit our veins
Tears of Rose Champagne
Mascara telling her tale
Revealin' her pain
She smilin' at the same time
She so high
We could live forever tonight
They'll never catch us, we'll never die
If you ain't scared to fly, it's rainin' outside
Ralph Lauren, duck boots, will suffice, slidin' high
Anita Baker serenaded my drive
Counted my first million dollars and I couldn't blink my eyes
Nowadays I'm used to it, I be smokin' while I do it
Crops is poppin' 'cause I grew it
On the flight, and I mack the stewardess
Writin' the truest 'cause I actually do this shit
Who it is

[Freddie Gibbs:]
You take some, you leave some
You never take it all
And the richer you get
The more able they are to get you
Police want ya, but guys get paid to shelf here
Everybody's out get ya when you got too much
But if we do get a lot, no matter what, show you what you got to lose
Know what I'm sayin'
Kane Train, I'm just gone dribble on this motherfucker right quick
Ya dig?

Ay yo, Bentley leather seats ready red
I do look like a G-O
She don't think the sex come with head?
I dodge a bitch like Neo
Pussy you ain't thuggin', you Huxtable nigga, you a Theo
Pyrex vision, pot got me pipin' hot, nigga, Tapatio

Me and Diego move like Frankie White and Cease-A-Leo
It's more than just twistin' your fingers up, you ain't deep with us
You ain't eat with us, you ain't sleep with us
Must of shot .223 with us
Pack ran outta Act, nigga
You ain't never fiend for that lean with us
It was stomach aches, heartbreaks
Warrants off of missed court dates
Eviction notice, 'bout to call the county
Sent the rent about a million months late

White shit, now that's the type shit
That put a nigga in a murder mindstate
Roll a blunt and lace it with the girl
Got a nigga zooted in another world
Got the Tony Tony on the desktop like a Mac Pro
Mom and pop ain't really have the job to get me Lego blocks
So I stacked dough
I went to my nigga Mac house and seen a hundred thousand on the trap floor
Got the strippers in here bustin' packs down, blow her back down, she a trap ho
Got the shooters at the front and back door
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

// Bundy & Sincere //

[Curren$y:]
Yeah, yeah, Eastside
Uh

Bullshit run a marathon
Rap shit got my parkin' Bentleys on a lawn
Continental Ts, got that red label Arnage
Don't confuse me with these other rap frauds
I'm a crocodile in the swamp, them niggas is little frogs
Back to back, G bodies, Chevies with my dogs
Freddie safe full of fetti, plottin' another heist
Already, I'm ready, already outside
Three in the morn', like Bundy told Sincere
My nigga come on, I'm 'bout to start blowin' the muhfuckin' horn
I'm tryna get everything I want painted and rimmed up
Before the fall really hit
This jet life shit, ESGN, sippin' juice and gin
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Money and yo' bitch, both on my line
Told shawty that I can't make it
Told money I'll be on the way, quick
Sands in the hour glass, so goes the days of our lives
Make sure you touch something luxurious before you die
Light one for Mac Miller, Blue Slide Park in the sky, still in here

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yeah
Rest in peace, Mac

Uh, wet dope on the Bounty paper, I lay it down
Let it dry, you can leave the money and stick around
Feel like I'm stuck in the system, runaway slave child
My lifestyle straight out the gang files
Kane train, insane, bunny rabbit five gang
Rest in peace Big Lord, he took a thigh shot in the main vein
Bitch, I rap for fun and sell that coca leaf to maintain
Niggas gettin' a check off of that Meth, I made a lane change
Walter White, Walter Wheat, cookin' up that Jesse Pink
Niggas'll open up they mouth to talk some shit
But they don't often eat
Me and my comrades is well fed, sincerely yours, unfadeable Fred
Kane

What else can I say? I say
You kept it real, today
