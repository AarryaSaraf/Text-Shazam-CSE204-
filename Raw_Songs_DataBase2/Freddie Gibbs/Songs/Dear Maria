Dear Maria, I know it was like 2010 the last time I had seen ya
Back when I used to hang outside, Actavis in my two liter
40 Cali,  pimping gotta keep the 9 mm
Plus I, plus I traded in the black Cadillac for the Beamer
I was trapping out a dirty apartment on Little Caesar's
Damn Maria, can I purchase a brick of yay from your people?
Homie front me with like five
Paid twenty-three for the eagle
Boy I live illegal

See the game it gone never change
See the game, got me everything
See the game it gone never change
Cocaine, Mary Jane, got me everything

Dear Maria, you always kept a young nigga fed
When I wasn't eatin'
Like when you set me up for the lick on them Puerto Ricans
Always said that if I get rich off this shit that you'd be the reason
Always said that if I'm gone jump out this shit that you'd be the reason
Gotta have a type of all type of bitches I gotta feed them
On the late night, with the dick game
Drugs in me got me creeping
I know you love me, know you can't picture a nigga leavin'
I ain't never leavin'
Never No never never say never nigga
Say motherfuck love and stay on your cheddar nigga
I wish that it felt like I had forever with you
But I know one day your gone find a better nigga
They gone wife you up, settle you down, they gone have a wedding witch-ya
I'm just a thug, I'll buy bottles and get a section witch-ya
Maria flip if she found out I'm fuckin' on her sister
Freddie Cane, Dog unchained
I'm just that kinda nigga

Got the game running in my veins
Got the game running in my veins
Blood on my opponent
Don't give a fuck, I flaunt it
All I ever wanted was everything

Living in the city where your shittin' on the city and the city got me blast
I got chickens in the city
And a cousin shippin' with me
Told her ain't no future with me
I'm addicted to this cash
Dear Maria
