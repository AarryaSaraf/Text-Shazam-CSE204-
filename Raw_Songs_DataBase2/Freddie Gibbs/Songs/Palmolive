'Caine season
Fuckin' my pastor's daughter and two Jesus pieces
Droppin' this blow on the basement floor, my Yeezy's squeakin'
Reppin the fam, I pledge allegiance, undefeated
Fuck the 40 acres and a mule, they gave us niggas the eagle
Popeye spoons and needles
Sold a piece of crack to police it's Mario Van Peebles
Servin' every prom queen and Pookie with that vanilla smoothie
Scary Gary, nigga, my neighborhood somethin' like Fallujah
Vladimir banana clip, move with Russian colluder shooters
Fuck a track hoe, sellin' that pussy on computers
Pimpin'll never die, Timberland, have a trunk of dueces
Trunk of deuce of hard white fish, then I made a wish
A smoker scrubbin' down my kitchen, I'm never gon' wash a dish
It's Mr. Clean, Glass All, Palmolive
These niggas don't know how hard you ridin' for they ass 'til you park it
In 1998 I sold a Glock-19 chopper
2018, I'm finna reclaim my fuckin' time to cop the Rollie flooded Maxine Waters
Fuck your poison, keep your vaccines off us
We got a reality star in the God damn office
Quite like the Regan Days
Fernado said he used to move chickens in the Noriega days
I disrespect his name and he signed my face with the razor blade
Baby Tony, top of the family like Johnny Sacrimoni
Chopping up this block white top of some Yoshi ala mode it's
Whoever kill him first is gonna get promoted
Boy, I was gettin' away with murder before Gazelle fucked Violas
Gangsta Gibbs

Young nigga, dope money, just have at it nigga
Make money, mo' money, mathematics nigga
But the po-po's, they comin' for yo money, nigga
Play low, I mean low, like no money, nigga

Young nigga, dope money, just have at it nigga
Make money, mo' money, mathematics nigga
But the po-po's, they comin' for yo money, nigga
Play low, I mean low, like no money, nigga

Look, real bars are the ill bars
These scars are the only real proof they couldn't kill Gods
My coke hand is still sketching out my memoirs
What I did to door panels on them Windstars
Gem stars left cuts in the dinner plates
There's new stash spots, the AC don't just ventilate
Take over your blocks, young niggas assimilate
We all break bread, like goin' dutch on a dinner date
The love of your life, rap nigga with fake watches
The serial number don't match the gift boxes
The bezel on her Ballon Bleu do the Tinashe
The bitch told me two-tone Rollies was too blahzay (Yugh!)
Way more chemical than political
PTSD from what I weighed on the digital
It was snowfall and Regan gave me the visual
Obama opened his doors, knowing I was a criminal
I took a risk, I took a brick
Took a road trip to a Motel 6
Get it wholesale and you know I won't tell shit
Ride coat tails, then he really want that lit
Just another in the mix nigga, I'm rich nigga
Tell me, is you Alpo or Mitch, nigga?
Bet it all, roulette, all on my wrist, nigga
Like Cleo, settin' it off, takin' yo' bitch, nigga, ooh!

Young nigga, dope money, just have at it nigga
Make money, mo' money, mathematics nigga
But the po-po's, they comin' for yo money
Nigga, play low, I mean low, like no money, nigga

Young nigga, dope money, just have at it nigga
Make money, mo' money, mathematics nigga
Brotha, low, low, like talkin' to baby mama, nigga
Fake rap, tell that bitch this is that show money, nigga


I know a guy in my neighborhood
He came home from work one day and caught his best friend in the hall with his wife
They had all day to go to bed
Pulled out a.45, shot both of 'em
Next morning, his friend went down to the jail
He said, "Fred, don't take it so hard"
He said, "It could have been worse"
He said, "What you mean, it could have been worse?"
He said, "Man, two people dead. I might get the electric chair. You tell me it could have been worse?"
He said, "Yeah, baby. It could have been worse."
He said, "What you mean?"
He said, "Hell, if you'd have came Thursday instead of Friday, you'd have gotten me too"
