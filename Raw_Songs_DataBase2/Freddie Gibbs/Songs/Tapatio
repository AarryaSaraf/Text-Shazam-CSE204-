Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh

It's like divin' out the plane
Once that music hit our veins
Tears of Rose Champagne
Mascara telling her tale
Revealin' her pain
She smilin' at the same time
She so high
We could live forever tonight
They'll never catch us, we'll never die
If you ain't scared to fly, it's rainin' outside
Ralph Lauren, duck boots, will suffice, slidin' high
Anita Baker serenaded my drive
Counted my first million dollars and I couldn't blink my eyes
Nowadays I'm used to it, I be smokin' while I do it
Crops is poppin' 'cause I grew it
On the flight, and I mack the stewardess
Writin' the truest 'cause I actually do this shit
Who it is


You take some, you leave some
You never take it all
And the richer you get
The more able they are to get you
Police want ya, but guys get paid to shelf here
Everybody's out get ya when you got too much
But if we do get a lot, no matter what, show you what you got to lose
Know what I'm sayin'
Kane Train, I'm just gone dribble on this motherfucker right quick
Ya dig?

Ay yo, Bentley leather seats ready red
I do look like a G-O
She don't think the sex come with head?
I dodge a bitch like Neo
Pussy you ain't thuggin', you Huxtable nigga, you a Theo
Pyrex vision, pot got me pipin' hot, nigga, Tapatio

Me and Diego move like Frankie White and Cease-A-Leo
It's more than just twistin' your fingers up, you ain't deep with us
You ain't eat with us, you ain't sleep with us
Must of shot .223 with us
Pack ran outta Act, nigga
You ain't never fiend for that lean with us
It was stomach aches, heartbreaks
Warrants off of missed court dates
Eviction notice, 'bout to call the county
Sent the rent about a million months late

White shit, now that's the type shit
That put a nigga in a murder mindstate
Roll a blunt and lace it with the girl
Got a nigga zooted in another world
Got the Tony Tony on the desktop like a Mac Pro
Mom and pop ain't really have the job to get me Lego blocks
So I stacked dough
I went to my nigga Mac house and seen a hundred thousand on the trap floor
Got the strippers in here bustin' packs down, blow her back down, she a trap ho
Got the shooters at the front and back door
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
