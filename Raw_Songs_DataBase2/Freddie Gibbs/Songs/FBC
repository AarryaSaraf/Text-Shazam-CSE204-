Yeah

You know what I'm sayin'?

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

I might pull in that Benz and your fist blows
I'm so clean I make the bitch take of her shoes
Drippin' water nothing monkey on my jewels
Give me good brain but that pussy do the fool
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
All my smokers smoke it on the spot and get they shit to go
I just left out Long Beach with ten bricks
I'm  banna boat
I jumped off the porch and jump straight on the plane
Smokers on that D block keep a nigga paid
Gucci on my runners put that on the gang
I know some famous rappers snitchin' I won't say no names

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go

Buckingham Palace with the palates on, I'm high as fuck
15 grams a year on the table, bitch come line 'em up
Brought 2 pounds of killer on my tour bus, but that ain't enough
She want my committee
Throw that pussy, but that ain't enough
Ain't enough, bitch you lame as fuck
Had you nigga  rode the bitch while I was layin' up
4 AM your ho be stayin' up 
My racks so loud I wake the neighbors up
I'm whippin' babies up like

Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Fendi buckle coat
Rockin' up the dope
Smoke it on the spot then get your shit to go
