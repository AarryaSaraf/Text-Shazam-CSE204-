Gold thangs on a bar of soap
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eastside
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ladada-dada, dada, dada
Uh, yeah

And that Rolls Royce float
Clean, like I put a set of gold things on a bar of soap
Within every bar another motivational quote
While these niggas going through phases
I never mutated or deviated from the life or mission statement
This is preservation of the vibe
Never let them forget the time
Well they say you was a rapper
You fasho had to know how to rhyme
I keep my passport close, 'cause it eases my mind
(Eases my mind)

It's a shame what they did to it
Now the rap just don't go that same route
When they take rawness away, just
Just they make it too pretty

I'm feelin' trapped on this revolvin' land mine
That could blow at any minute
Saturday night special with one bullet in the chamber
And six cylinders spinnin'
Russian Roulette, the American Dream could be your death
Or it could be everything


It's M.O.B. everything
Back in '03 had Gucci seats, I put Gs on everything
Made matrimony with this game
I got cocaine wedding rings
Them niggas taxin' for the nina
They want like ten and some change
I got my tears and my pain
I got my balls and my girl
And I ain't breakin' that shit for a nigga or bitch
That shit is absurd
I'm controversial with these verbs
Like Christopher Wallace with words

Felix Mitchell with birds

Malcolm X with the perm

Nigga

Freddie Gibbs; I heard the name, but I didn't know
Like, I didn't know how good he was
It was after the photoshoot
After I had already shook hands with him and met him
I told him this when I seen him again, too, out in LA
I was like, yo, I was like, yo, I ain't even know, like, you really good

Yeah
Bitch hit my line said she wanna go eat and drink and smoke and shit (Goofy bitch)
Before I hung up, I said call me when you want some dick
(Want some dick)
I'll never go broke in this game
I'll charge it on a bitch (Charge it on a bitch)
So, my family and my kids will never want for shit
Stuck in a cell with no windows but I got a pot to piss
Smokin' that dope on a daily
Fucked up the probation, I gotta go drop some piss
Hop in a truck, and I throw on that Twista
Adrenaline Rush on some mobster shit

Even when niggas was broke
We made it look rich, bitch, I'ma optimist
My presence'll fuck up your confidence
Freaky bitches, I'm they confidant
Trappin' out of muh fuckas rappers, slappin' these Poppadocs
RZA with the zippers, official men chop it off the block
Once I made an M, I ain't give a fuck if I popped or not
And I can't swim, a nigga ain't never had dreams of coppin' yachts
But I kowabunga, servin' that pussy at a thousand knots
Rest in peace to Ruck; tell Jesus I need a billion bucks

Goon with the balloon, ain't no helium, but I sealed him up
Feel the rush
