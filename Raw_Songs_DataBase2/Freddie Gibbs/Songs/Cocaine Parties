La-dickda-da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La-da-da-da-dickda-da-a, la-a (la-a, la-a, la-a)
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

Cocaine parties in L.A
I'm juggin' at some cocaine parties in L.A., yeah
Cocaine parties in L.A
Threw my set up at some mo' gang parties in L.A
Gangsta Gibbs
Los Angeles
Do it (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Uh, I do it (Shake that body, party that body)
Bitch, I do it (Shake that body, party that body)
Bitch, I do it, yeah

Hey killa, you forgot your soda dawg
My mama kitchen stankin' from the last order dawg
So many cocaine transactions I don't recall
Was lit, tell the judge and the preacher presiding over y'all
Fuck the police protocol
We choppin' loads up, in the crib
No heat by the stove my toes froze up
Niggas like to fuck up their re-up money
Get rolled up
Bullet holed-up
Ran off on the plug once (once nigga)
Minor setback, major comeback
Two bitches at the Ritz Carlton I was dumb hype
I dropped the chicken then remixed it, it was dumb white
Fuck her pretty face and that pussy hoe, what your funds like
Fucked her in some $5,000 shoes or pumps right
Allergic to these weak ass hoes, nigga gesundheit
Miss my Harlem bitch, buss that pussy open in one night
But last time I was out in New York I got in a gunfight
Blowbiz to the showbiz
I kick rap burnin' like kermit sippin' on hoe tears
Million dollar world tour, a nigga with no spins
Everyday I got a new cousin, nigga we no kin
And all this internet shit done fucked up the era
That bitch ain't been the same since 'Ye dropped her off
At the airport
They only gave us 28 days so make em last
The black delegation would like to trade Stacey Dash
For Adele and Margot Robbie, let's get it poppin', we on
Fuck it, even trade, we even throw in a Raven Symone
Filthy Jet Black nigga Backstage full of white bitches
No I don't sell like Macklemore, but I've got White Privilege
Try not to sell no crack no more, tryna stay out the prison
That Heron shit will get your ass a gas price sentence
That snitchin' shit will leave you marked just like a life sentence
That snitchin' shit will get your family and your wife missin'
Play position, these niggas friendly as a box of puppies
I drop big nuts on this game, they holdin' chicken nuggets
My backwood rolled up with dirty, you smell that
Seen myself on Comedy Central, hope they bring Chappelle back
Feds listenin', all this talk about the scale be scaled back
Seen India Love nudes, a nigga trying to nail that
A couple weeks I'm in Toronto I'ma see all my bitches
But all my niggas can't cross the border for that all-star shit
But niggas be creepin' for the weekend, give her that all-star dick
I want that pussy, head, mouth, ass, and all that shit

Cocaine parties in L.A
Throw ya' set up at some more gang parties in L.A
I know some neighborhood Pirus that sell yay (Los Angeles)
I got homies with them pound 6 - o's (R60) and 8 Trays
Nigga shoutout to my Mexican partner, forgot about 'em (Shake that body, party that bod-)
When he come back across the border, we throwin' a powder party
(Shake that body, party that body)
