Find a way to bring me home
Darkness is washing over the sky
When all the trees burned down
Where does the crow fly?

Take this as an offering
Empty promises are dead
All the rage and pain is gone
Soon, all the rivers run red

All that matter is gone
There is nowhere else to go
No place for us to hide
Nothing above and nothing below

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death

It was easy to hide in the crowd
We acted numb to the warnings ahead
With everything that's rotten
Even the marching ants have fled

All that matter is gone
There is nowhere else to go
No place for us to hide
Nothing above and nothing below

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death

And the world has closed its eyes
Mother time draws her final breath
The innocent washed away
The condemned, the dance of death
