It seems so real when you whisper
Just like holding down your breath

We're slowly dying
So how do we solve this without regrets?

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

We have to fight through the shadows
I feel we've lost the spark
Ignite the dampened spirits
And build a brand new arc

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

We will burn in the fire
We will be branded in flames
We will have to rise from the ashes
From the fires of our own mistakes

This is a war and no one will win it
This is a war and no one will win it

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

Countless voices in the dark
Speak of the end that isn't far
The pain, the rage, our scars
Countless voices in the dark

This is a war and no one will win it
