Mother time
Please be gentle, I need to figure this out
It's not black or white
I see colors what is that about?

Caught a glimpse of the end
It's not pretty, no one will win
No one will win

My last breath
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out

I'm the desolate
The one that doesn't want to exist
Still I deserve the answer
For the time that you create

No such thing as a promised land
This is it, dive right in
The brain is such a wonderful thing
No one knows what life will bring

My last breath
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out

My last breathe
You got me on my knees
I'm bleeding out
The darkest days
But it seems it's not enough
I'm bleeding out
