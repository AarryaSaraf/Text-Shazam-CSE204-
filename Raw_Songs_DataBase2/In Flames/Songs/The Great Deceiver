Back to reality once again
A two-year break to reset our brains
(A two-year break to reset our brains)
But times are changing for the worse (the worse)
We are doomed, we are cursed (cursed)

Nothing but pain
This is the end

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry

The lines are drawn and the rules are set
Your actions, the world won't forget
Nowhere to run, there's no escape
Misery's here, there's no hope left

Mankind, too unkind to be renowned
Joey was right, this is the final countdown

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry

Bend the truth to fit your opinion
Another excuse, another lie
It's not what you say, it's what you do
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
The sky is on fire and the angels cry
