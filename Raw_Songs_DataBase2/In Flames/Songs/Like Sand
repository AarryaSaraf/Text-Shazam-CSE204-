I believe that the whole wide world is against me
I, I, I believe that the whole wide world is afraid of me

How did I end up here
Half a life and still full of fears
If I'm honest I think you'll see
I'm scared to share what's calling for me
You say, make the most of your time
How's it work when it's not on your side
What can't kill you makes you stronger
So I heard but I'm going under

I will try, I will try
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
(I want the whole world)

I try hard to be like you
You're my Queen but I break in two
I think I can overcome all the mistakes that I've done
You say, make the most of your time
How's it work when it's not on your side
What can't kill you makes you stronger
So you say but I'm going under

I will try, I will try
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand

I believe that the whole wide world is afraid of me

I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
I want the whole world, the whole world, the whole world in my hands
But it's just slipping through like sand
