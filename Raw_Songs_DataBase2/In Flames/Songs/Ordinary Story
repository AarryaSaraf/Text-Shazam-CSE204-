Egoism dictates human relations
A world where fashion outshines morality
Here success is written in blood-red colours
Designed by the thirst for power

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all too ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter
So bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web

A time represented by the void
An excuse without content
Stuck in the abyss of existence
With a content void of excuse

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all too ordinary story
This is my story
With an aftertaste so bitter

Sinking deeper down
I'm caught, I'm caged
I'm gone

An all too ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter
So bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web
