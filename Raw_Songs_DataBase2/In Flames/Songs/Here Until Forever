I can't wait to hear your voice again
I am far from lonely but without you I'm a mess
I close my eyes and drift away
And I'm wondering what you're doing now

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be

Mind and soul we are the same
A hand on your heart, you know I am there
You are my lighthouse in the dark
I can see you from a thousand miles

Forever I will always be

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be

I hope you feel that nothing dies
I am alive in all you touch
Close my eyes and drift away
Wondering what you're doing now
(Wondering what you're doing right now)

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me (I see me)

When I look at you I see me
We will always be part of history
When I look at you I see me
Forever I will always be
