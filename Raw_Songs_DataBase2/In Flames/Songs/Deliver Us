Remind me I'm golden...
The fortress above the sun
Why don't you spend nowhere with me?
Follow the river and the path of the ones write our names

On the shore

Forever - I can't find
Struggling in a world undefined
Decide how you want it to be
I'm not eternity

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today feeling alive

It starts to fall apart
Let me take control, reminisce

The days and nothing more
Something I will find again, deliver us
Can't hear the words you say

But it doesn't really matter
I give the world to you, if you just

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today ....alive

[Solo]

Fly into the distant
Disappear for awhile
I can't make sense of this
But we're here today alive
