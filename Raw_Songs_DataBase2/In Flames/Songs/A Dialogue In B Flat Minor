All you see is me breathing fire

Can you see the madness or do I hide it all too well?
Ask the right question, you will have a show and tell
I see spiders crawling up the wall
It's only a matter of time
I lose all sense of control

All the clowns they look the same
Afraid I'm gonna suffocate
Have I gone insane?
Am I the devil's bait?

Give me the strength to fly away
Don't recognize this place, I think I derailed

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I feel like I'm being erased
Can't explain the way I feel
All you see is me breathing fire
Can't explain so you'll believe

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

I can't see how things will change
Will those feelings ever fade?

All you see is me breathing fire
Have I gone insane?

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real

There's a ghost in my head I fight everyday
And sometimes he gets his way
I'm stuck in a loop, I'm trying to feel
I'm hearing him speak so I know that it's real
