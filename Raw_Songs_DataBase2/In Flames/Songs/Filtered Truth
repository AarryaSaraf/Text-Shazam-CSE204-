We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Is this what you are searching for?

The wounded and it's filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

Your back turned against the world, you knew
A place to hide from everything
Am I the hand that made you fall?

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside that wipes it all away?
The rage inside
