Here in my room
I'm behind the wall
I'm out of reach
I don't sympathize
Adjusting the level of delusion
Feel like you're one of the sane
Encoding the white noise
Lose my way and fall again

Creating dreams from a broken past
It tears a hole and sucks you dry
If you know secrets tell me now
Creating dreams, let the worlds collide
Escape the void and feel alive
Don't have any answers but I'll survive

Here in my room
I'm behind the wall
Away from the flock
Closure will come
Adjusting the high of expectation
Feel like you're one of the brave
Dig deeper
Find a new path and climb again

Creating dreams from a broken past
It tears a hole and sucks you dry
If you know secrets tell me now
Creating dreams, let the worlds collide
Escape the void and feel alive
Don't have any answers but I'll survive
