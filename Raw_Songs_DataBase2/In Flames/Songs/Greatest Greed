I sold you once (once!)
I sold you twice (twice!)
I sold you a third time, and still you're backing out
I hit you once, I hit you twice
You start to scream and still it doesn't count

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are

My head's a mess (mess!)
My broken bones (bones!)
I feel like a victim, but you're not in control
You're filled with rage, one last mistake
You are no victim, just one without a soul

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are

Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?
Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?

A single sound, one-two-three times
The Greatest Greed is just an empty thrive

So here we are
What's left of us will come to an end
So here we are




Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?
Why? Why?
Don't you walk away?
