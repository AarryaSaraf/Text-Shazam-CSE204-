Album: Subterranean

// Stand Ablaze //

The time is now
Please tell me how
Set ablaze...
Crying,
Remembering how it used to be
Scarred for eternity
Was it meant to be?
A life in harmony...

Bleeding, regretting...

Solitary life
Committing suicide
Seeking sanctuary
From this world, contrary

Stand Ablaze
Screaming
As the flames caress my face
Stand Ablaze...

// Everdying //

Die
Tragedy, cursing me
Bloodlust, crying, never dying
Bloodlust, crying, never dying

From the cold, shadowed waste
Evil grasped my soul and took my hand

Left alone and filled with desire
A spawn of evil and eternal fire

Timeless, immortal, everlasting hate
Timeless, immortal, everlasting hate
Hate...

Drinking the wine
An act out of love
Consumer of lives
You'll join us tonight...

Behold immortality
A dark eternity
Eternity, eternity...

Drinking the wine
An act out of love
Consumer of lives
You'll join us tonight

// Subterranean //

My tears fall like rain
From the longlasting pain
When I look at your eyes
My heart just dies
Beauty divine
I hope you'll be mine
Open your arms
For all time

All dressed in white
Bringer of light
Spend time with me
All through the night

Beauty divine
Your tears taste like wine
Come to me
For all time

My spine shivers with the touch of your lips...
My pale skin turns red when we kiss...
Piercing your nails deep into my back...
As I slowly kiss your ivory neck...

I started to cry after hours of joyful sin...
My tears turned to roses as they embraced your skin...
I gathered them to a bouquet of the most beautiful flowers...
A bouquet of the most secret and ancient powers...

My amber heart started to glow as I died really slow...

// Biosphere //

Slowly the winter wind tears my skin
Blood freezes in my veins
I wish you were here beside me
To release me from my pain
Last night you promised me
You were still in love with me
Please come set me free
From my misery

I love you
Truth be told
I'm completely numb
It got this way
I don't know how
I just can't figure it out

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?

Last night you promised me
You were still in love with me
Please come set me free
From my misery

I love you
Truth be told
I'm completely numb
It got this way
I don't know how
I just can't figure it out

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?

Slowly twists my pride
Freezing as I die
Coldly I fade away
My life cannot be saved
Slowly the winter wind tears my skin
Blood freezes in my veins
I wish you were here beside me
To release me from my pain

Please try to remember me
Lord please send help for me
Trying, can't you see?
Why must this be?

Please talk to me
What do you want me to be?

// The Inborn Lifeless //

Close your eyes and pray the wind will take me far away
Life is like a stone behind my back of a second degree
Start
Life is a feather of fall between the monument tear
Like a powder fragile the one that blows behind the
Faithful dead
All the doors of eternal gray
This weakness take beyond the dream
With a silent void you're left while you can hardly breathe
Vastly they destroy the tears of my lies
Fears are fading away, robbed to face the bitterness
In search for my dear
Castle burries the bite of a queen
Wherever the sorrow rises from distance like a rainbow
I'll be there again, to weep behind with my tears
Heyargh!
Wake me
The second lifeless to be
