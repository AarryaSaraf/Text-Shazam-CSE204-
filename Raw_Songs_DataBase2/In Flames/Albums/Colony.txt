Album: Colony

// Embody The Invisible //

I demand nothing, but I want it all
What privilege do we have under the sun,
That gives us the right to the throne?

Species come and go, but the earth stands forever fast
All river runs towards the sea, but the sea is never full

To discover the loneliness and to be proud to show the wounds
Will forever wander alone through the years

But I won't let you near
Begging for you to understand
The fear that lives in my soul
Which is an untouched spring

Read, what is written on the silent mouth
What is written in the soul
For which is written in the shining silence
We all have to read

My body will be bent from the burdens
When the shaking floor of life-force
Reveal its chasm underneath
If only one could be two steps ahead

// Ordinary Story //

Egoism dictates human relations
A world where fashion outshines morality
Here success is written in blood-red colours
Designed by the thirst for power

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all too ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter
So bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web

A time represented by the void
An excuse without content
Stuck in the abyss of existence
With a content void of excuse

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all too ordinary story
This is my story
With an aftertaste so bitter

Sinking deeper down
I'm caught, I'm caged
I'm gone

An all too ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter
So bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web

// Scorn //

I perish and nobody will know
As my mouth remains still
My heart awaits me, filled with gravel
As the pain grows with each touch

Since I marked her out from my tower
Reality focused through forbidden lenses
She owns enough of preciousness
A penalty given by the source

But I still have no choice through
The hinderens frighten
A labyrinth closing at the edge of space

But they never allow
She's shut... for all beings but one
I give, I scorn, I threat

// Colony //

In your world, the day is no threat
In my world, there is an absence of light
"Genetic superior cell" controlled
By the fathomless and unbearable

A radical new Form of plastic and rage
Biologically optimized
But with a strangling pulse

In your world, you find me worthy
In my world, I "parashoot" my life
A virtual drugstore populated
By the fathomless and unbearable

Machine, meat and blood
In an intimate relationship
The new - superior -
More effective than all the preceding

When we can no longer
Cry and reality is torn
Then it's easy to forget
That the responsibility lies on us all

In your world, the night is no threat
In my world, the darkness
Transforms to a vision of hell
Populated by fathomless and unbearable

// Zombie Inc //

Truth serves them embrace
And defend her case
Part flattery, part threats
"For those who cling to this
Dominion will partake in its fall"

With his silence, he passes the
Judgement over them
"With your feverish signs of force
You'll make them and yourself to
Believe that he still retains his full power"

As a platform for divine foundations,
You want to make them suck

Shallowness and beauty
Was all that concerned her body
But the soul, her divine guest
Were thrust to the bottom

Surrendered to the sect
That has risen from its womb
"For those who cling to this
Dominion will partake in its fall"

// Coerced Coexistence //

I'll take you on a ride
As a part-owner to my pain
Our ideals they collide
Coerced coexistence

I fought the world today - postpone my birth again
We stumble on and on - but bound to die alone

Pine - I'm selling my soul today
Pine - I need some sympathy

This infiltrates my brain
"In the sunshine the sun is mine"
Pitiless wanderer
Close your eyes and bow your head
Grotesque thoughts in a line
Threw my wings into the blazing sun
Smile stretched on old trees
Eternal Bringing jester masque

Don't hurt a fly they all sing
We're just ants in a great big play
Commercialize-infect-annihilate-progress
Visualize-inhale-pretend-betray

// Resin //

A sad song it was,
Through renewal it brought
And a month seems sometimes shorter
Than a half nights longing

Hidden and hard are the reasons for war
Polar twist, invert and flea

I can't dissolve this feeling of mine
But patience will unlock the door
And the maps of reasons re-written for me
When the wait is over and the punishment is due
Each day I crawl to the hall of the giants

And I beg for mercy -
And I beg for mercy in vain
One night is a mare - two is worse
How can I manage three?

// Behind Space '99 //

Call me by my astral name
Breeding fear through wordless tongue
Heavenly thirst - unspeakable pain
Emptied from all human motion
Confront the faceless wrath

Beckoning silent from a sphere behind space
Through twisted ruins of uncompleted dreams
Sights of towers reaching for the moon
Clawing at the skies - they gonna pull it down

Intensity - I feel the lava rushing through my veins
Stars are reforming - to enter the fourth dimension

Beyond all galaxies
Through timeless aeons of frost
Unearthly hunger - angels descent

We are entering dimensions behind space

// Insipid 2000 //

Should I defend you for who you are?
The laws are changed and useless!

On their way to a deserted town
Where empty windows wave goodbye
A helpless excuse, a falling reality
I'm changed by the shock
And the weight of the punch
A helpless excuse, a falling reality

Fragments of a futile being
A puzzle to the noble ones
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

The world around me -
Spartanic, minimalistic
A helpless excuse, a falling reality
The large scale plan that once where
You've now drained from life
A helpless excuse, a falling reality

Who knows the proper reasons
Why it all begins and ends?
Ignorant and pitiless they stride

"You are but a form",
The clean, harsh silence passes
"Genuine" visions by the noble
Ones for the noble ones

// The New Word //

The great word of blessedness
And a feeling of ease
A cup of the well of freedom
And life we joyfully drink
Inside, all was new, but outwards
Nothing had changed

An escapade,
Then to the altar to
Evaluate all parts
Of the great mystery
But all remains
On the same spot,
No signs of a new season

In my hand is a new word,
But the word is still
Without a body
A hidden life-stream that
Swells in the deep
Will soon give the word
A 2nd face

// Clad In Shadows '99 //

Reach for your razor
Cut through the dawn
See through your inner wrath
keys shan't open the doors

Behold my heart has stopped
My lungs are laid the final rest
And still I see and too I feel
Yes, but to earthly eyes I am gone
To the lands where legends never die
Take me to the twilight land tonight

Again and again and again, every night
The darkness climbs through my walls
Where the screaming is silent to the corrupted ears

Never to any man I will spear
My speech it has no value
Eyes that have seen the sights
Bleed through the ages eternal

I ask no more
A life has just begun
Never, never see the sun
And do I miss it?
No, my eyes are black
Emotions fled through eyelids closed
Throne of thorns
Clad in shadows
