// Trigger (Edit) //

Is it dark or is it bright
What's the latest on the screen
Please tell me my name
I haven't checked it today

I am running from something that I don't know
I am searching for something, which way to go
I am trying to separate what's real
I'm running in a wheel

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

Avoid infinity
Are you for real

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few
A sign of times my friend

Just scratch the surface
And you will find
Something to blame for a long lost time

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why
Are we dancing all alone

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few

From green to red our days pass by
Waiting for a sign to tell us why

Collect some stars to shine for you
And start today cause there's only a few

// Watch Them Feed //

I lost my visual
Cause all you fucks are in my way
So drop her off this route
Take em to some far place
Watch them feed

Seal the signs of the borders 
We are here to bend
Penetrate the outlines 
Lightness of color 

They say the world is struggling
But we are stuck upside down 

Imaginary reality
Suffer from make believe
I'll chance the fate 
Take em to some far place
Watch them feed 

They say the world is struggling 
But we are stuck upside down 

No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you
No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you

They say the world is struggling 
But we are stuck upside down

No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you
No purpose, no scorn
No sorrow will be wasted on you

// Land Of Confusion //

I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving in, into the streets

Now did you read the news today
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fire's still alight
Burning burning, into the night

There's too many men
Too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh Superman, where are you now
When everything gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, men of power
Losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go around
Tell me why this is the land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men
There's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go around
Can't you see this is the land of confusion.

Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for

This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to

// Cloud Connected (Club Connected Remix) //

People like you
You live in a dream world
You despise the outside 
And you fear you're the next one

It's in your dream
There's just one question
Should I kill
Or should I be left behind

Sick and tired
Of all your complaints
This is the hour
We bring it down

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

You seem to be
So introverted
How come we fail

You crossed the line
You remember my name
Time runs backwards
As we're heading that way

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

Cloud connected

I've come to realize
Every little glimpse, you fade
I was told that I could fly
When least expected, cloud connected

I've come to realize
Cloud connected
I was told that I could fly
Cloud connected
