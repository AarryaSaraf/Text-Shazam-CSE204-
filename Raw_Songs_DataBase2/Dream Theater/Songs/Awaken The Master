Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance
Keeps you alive

A flower unfolds
A heartbeat brings new meaning to the universe
The angel of balance
Keeps you strong
Discovering what has been all along

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

You made it to the top
Just to find out
You're only halfway there
All along missing the point of the journey

The will of the soul
Like a peak so high
You look inside to rise
Searching out a dream
Climbing, reaching further
And the voices of the angels bring you closer

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

Spinning through life
Lost in the spiral of time

Turning the stone
Circles of darkness and light

Spinning through life
We balance the heart and the mind

Turning the stone
Embracing the truth that we find

Remember hereafter
The end of a chapter
Awaken the master
Awaken the master
