Carry it away
Carry it away again
Have nothing to say
Nothing to say again
No one needs to be alone
Get my ego on the phone

Walking again
Walking again today
Who will I drain?
Who will I drain today?
No one wants to see me drown
And no one wants to be let down

Sorry about your secret garden
Is it too late to beg your pardon?
Didn't expect your soul to harden
Are you already gone?
Too late

Where are you now?
Blind and deaf
No one's left to come around
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare

You read the writing on the wall
Will Jesus catch you when you fall?
Heaven's filled with empty prayers
Pray too hard and no one cares

Sorry about your secret garden
Is it too late to beg your pardon?
Didn't expect your soul to harden
Are you already gone?
Too late

Where are you now?
Blind and deaf
No one's left to come around
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare

So there you are
Beyond the crowd
What do you hear to talk so loud?
Beneath the wall
Is where you'll fall
And wanting more
And losing all
(You're one step away)
Losing all
(You're one step away)
Losing all

Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna
Life ain't gonna comfort you
Life ain't gonna
Life ain't gonna
No one's gonna comfort you

Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare
Where are you now?
Lost out there
Where eyes no longer stare
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Lost out there (Lost out there)
(Where eyes no longer)
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Lost out there (Lost out there)
