When you face the creature
That waits beneath your bed
Will you stare into its eyes or look away?

Running toward the fire
Or fleeing from the flame
The choice to seek or hide is yours to make

The serpent inside
Wrapping its tail around my neck
I'm buried alive
Dying to take another breath

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Hiding, never showing its face
Feeding on irrational fear
Thoughts race at a feverish pace
Soaring on a flight of ideas

Perched on its victim's shoulder
Whispering in its ear
Things that may never happen
Worries too much to bear

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave
Invisible monster

Invisible monster
Always felt but never seen
Unwelcome presence refusing to leave

Invisible monster
Beast that dwells inside my mind
Give up your hold let me take back control
Invisible monster
Invisible monster
