I remember when we were so young
You embraced my fears and made me strong
Never did you actually hold my hand
Your silence no one else would understand

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside

Do you like the clothes she wears today
Colliding love affair against a shade
Often times I wish she'd speak to me
Her holy open book, a world revealed to see

Did you fall?
Did you crawl?
Will you open up at all?
Did you hear
Things you fear?
Did I make it clear?

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me all you're feeling inside

So easy, easier
If you spoke to me
So easy, easier
Speak to me

Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're feeling inside
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me what you're thinking
Tell me all you're feeling inside
