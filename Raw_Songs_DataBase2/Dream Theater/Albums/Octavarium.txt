// The Root Of All Evil //

[VI. Ready]

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be

[VII. Remove]

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out of this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul

I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go
I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day
I am ready
Help me be what I can be
I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

// The Answer Lies Within //

Look around
Where do you belong?
Don't be afraid
You are not the only one

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies within

Life is short, so learn from your mistakes
And stand behind the choices that you made
Face each day with both eyes open wide
And try to give, don't keep it all inside

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
The answer lies within

You've got the future on your side
You're gonna be fine now
I know whatever you decide
You're gonna shine!

Don't let the day go by
Don't let it end
Don't let a day go by, in doubt
You're ready to begin

Don't let a day go by in doubt
The answer lies within

// These Walls //

This is so hard for me
To find the words to say
My thoughts are standing still
Captive inside of me
All emotions start to hide
And nothing's getting through

Watch me fading
I'm losing all my instincts
Falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls for me now

So much uncertainty
I don't like this feeling
I'm sinking like a stone
Each time I try to speak
There's a voice I'm hearing
And it changes everything

Watch me crawl from
The wreckage of my silence
Conversation failing

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls

Every time you choose to turn away
Is it worth the price you pay?
Is there someone who will wait for you
One more time? One more time?

Watch me fading
I'm losing all my instincts
Falling into darkness

Tear down these walls for me
Stop me from going under
You are the only one who knows I'm holding back
It's not too late for me
To keep from sinking further
I'm trying to find my way out
Tear down these walls for me now

Tear down these walls for me
It's not too late for me
Tear down these walls for me

// I Walk Beside You //

There's a story in your eyes
I can see the hurt behind your smile
For every sign I recognize
Another one escapes me

Let me know what plagues your mind
Let me be the one to know you best
Be the one to hold you up
When you feel like you're sinking

Tell me once again
What's beneath the pain you're feeling
Don't abandon me
Or think you can't be saved

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far

Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Summon up your ghosts for me
Rest your tired thoughts upon my hands
Step inside this sacred place
When all your dreams seem broken

Resonate inside this temple
Let me be the one who understands
Be the one to carry you
When you can walk no further

Tell me once again
What's below the surface bleeding
If you've lost your way
I will take you in

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far

Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

Oh, when everything is wrong
Oh, when hopelessness surrounds you
Oh, the sun will rise again
The tide you swim against
Will carry you back home
So don't give up
Don't give in

I walk beside you
Wherever you are
Whatever it takes
No matter how far

Through all that may come
And all that may go
I walk beside you
I walk beside you

// Panic Attack //

All wound up, on the edge, terrified
Sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
Bouts of fear permeate all I see
Heightening nervousness threatens me

I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

Caught off guard, warning signs never show
Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane
Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly reeling

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

Helpless hysteria
A false sense of urgency
Trapped in my phobia
Possessed by anxiety
Run, try to hide
Overwhelmed by this complex delirium

// Never Enough //

Cut myself open wide
Reach inside
Help yourself
To all I have to give
And then you help yourself again
And then complain that
You didn't like the way
I put the knife in wrong
You didn't like the way
My blood spilled on your brand new floor

What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

Sacrifice my life
Neglect my kids and wife
All for you to be happy!
All those sleepless nights
And countless fights to give you more
And then you say how dare that
I didn't write you back
I must be too good for you
I only care about myself

What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough

What would you say
If I walked away?
Would you appreciate?
But then it'd be too late!
Because I can only take so much of your ungrateful ways
Everything is never enough!

// Sacrificed Sons //

[Samples from TV news on 2001/09/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically 
Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their Sacrificed Sons
All praise their Sacrificed Sons

Teach them
What to think and feel
Your ways
So enlightening 
Words they preach
I can't relate
If God's true Love
Are acts of Hate

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their Sacrificed Sons
All praise their Sacrificed Sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?
There's no time
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?

// Octavarium //

[I. Someone Like Him]

I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him!

So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time

As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him

[II. Medicate (Awakening)]

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years, where have I been?
Eyes open, but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening

I feel the relapse, can't break free
Eyes open, but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear, as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

[III. Full Circle]

Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle be careful with
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

(Running forward, falling back) Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in) Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up) Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to) Find I've come full circle

[IV. Intervals]

Root, our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Second, asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Third, try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Fourth, loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Fifth, tortured Insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail
Sixth, the calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Seventh, innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Octave, step after step, we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!

[V. Razor's Edge]

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge
A perfect sphere colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began!
