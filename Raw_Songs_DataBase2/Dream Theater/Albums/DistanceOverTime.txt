Album: DistanceOverTime

// Untethered Angel //

You've built this world around you, your universe
In spite of best intentions, things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free

Misgiving and dismay, nightmares of wasted days
Can't live your life this way, something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts; entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free
Set you free

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart, be set free

// Paralyzed //

The anger, the pressure, you're choking down
Your words again, feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration, they see right through you
Paper thin, like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

The stare of a stranger, is like a wound
That bleeds again, silent as the dead
The victim, the martyr, like Daniel
In the Lion's Den, time and time again

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?
Viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed

// Fall Into The Light //

Written on the water, memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open, darkness drifts away
Time and space like roses, whose petals drop and fade
And fall into the light as if dreams of yesterday

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred, only Heaven knows
So turn towards the sun and look into your soul

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
It's become so clear to me

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
The truth is clear to me

// Barstool Warrior //

In a dark and lonely corner of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits the local barstool warrior, talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions, he motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?

Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck, call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right, what went wrong
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights, on the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger with anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she's in?

Or is it too late?

Was it bad luck, was it fate
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right, something's wrong
Just where do I belong?

Promises made, crying in vain
All empty, never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears, as months turn to years
All wasted on someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains

No one can save you
And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think, all you feel, all you dream

Now I'm cutting the anchor away
And I won't look back
I'm starting a new life today
Now I see where I belong

// Room 137 //

Someone
Someone is trying
To tell him something
Will he listen?
Should he listen?

Someone
Someone is dying
To find out something
Will he reason?
What is the reason?

Do you see it, there on the door?
Death is coming, life nevermore
Obsession drives me, clouding my mind
What's the message, am I running out of time?

Someone
Someone is trying
In search of something
Death by numbers
Getting closer

Someone
Someone is dying
To know the answer
The key to heaven
One thirty seven

Do you see it, there on the door?
Death is coming, life nevermore
Obsession drives me, clouding my mind
What's the message, am I running out of time?

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Hidden by design

I can see it, here on the door
One-three-seven, forevermore
Between dimensions, the boundary line
One-three-seven, I am running out of time

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Let me see before I die

// S2N //

Are we paying attention or are we drifting?
Too much negative action, not enough positive reaction

What's the state of humanity?
Where's the peace and the harmony?
Free the signal, your inner voice
Time to transcend, block out the noise

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel

Have you heard the news?
A surging sea of circumstance
Pain, starvation, war, abuse
Sterile gloves hide dirty hands

Shocking truth, climate change
Floods and fires, hurricanes
Overdose, suicide
Innocent die
Fear and race, endless lies
Sex and faith, terrorize
Drugs and guns taking lives
Innocent die

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Signal to noise defines the reason
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Signal to noise defines the reason
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal
The chatter disappears and the message is revealed

// At Wit's End //

Let me help you, how much longer 'til you realize?
You're getting worse, it's killing you inside
I can't break through, feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

You feel I'm asking too much of you but can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy, empty and hollow
You lost your faith, there's no getting through. Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery, can't figure it out

Sleepless, worse for wear
Staring at the ceiling
Numb, sedated, intoxicated

Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you

Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate, there is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never ending tide

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Don't leave me now

// Out Of Reach //

There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
I swear she cast a spell on me
Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away

Try to find the words
None sit right with me
Air of confidence
But I can barely breathe

She's without a care
Electrified and held there
A thousand volts igniting me
Her waves crash over me
Far below, out of reach
The undertow, my reverie

Sadness in her smile
Love, it's been a while
Near but far away
She chases it each day
A promise to come back
All the while still waiting
Seems it lost its way

Out of reach
Just too hard to reach
You're letting your life slip away
Out of reach
Yeah, it's hard to reach
There's another day
Although you're hurting and afraid
You're stronger than yesterday

// Pale Blue Dot //

So far away from home, beyond a distant reach
Faint whispers from the edge, returning piece by piece
A lonely point of light, captured in a final glance
A solitary hint of life, discovered if by chance

God creators, dream destroyers
Spineless cowards and fearless warriors
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers
Our blood-filled rivers fueled by hate
We worship heroes, kings and saints
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

All you will ever know, all life that ever was
All you despise or love, living out their lives
This isolated speck, hurtling through the cosmic dark
Would seem to go astray if we were washed away

God creators, dream destroyers
Knowledge seekers and bold explorers
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers
All on this place we call our home
Adrift in space, we're on our own
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

// Viper King //

Venomous by design
Lying idle, biding time
Bore down the clutch, tore up the road
Six hundred horses, genetic code
Lightning speed, the road she bends
Slammed down the brakes, losing my ass end

Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

Speed demon, tempting fate
Do or die, in the blink of an eye

Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King
My Viper King
My Viper King
