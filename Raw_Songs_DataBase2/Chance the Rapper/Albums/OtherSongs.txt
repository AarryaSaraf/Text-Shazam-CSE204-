// #SoGoneChallenge //

Thanks for filming this
I wrote this for you today
Chano A.K.A. Mr. Windy City
Remix!

I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...

// 65th & Ingleside //

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

I can spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep with my baby, yeah
So I don't wake up wonder where my baby at
I wonder if we'd make it back
I wonder can I pay her back, be her baby dad
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jaime got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know anyway not a no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the east side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention Ingle city
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and knock on your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th & Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Till God decide to come bring you by

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Where's the return on investment?
My friends saying 'Nah! '
That shit was played unless you were here playing the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold scar
Better get late 'for it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she can play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with firework
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, it's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go and order a dib
My big homie told me "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew you came there
Got shit sunny now you can't share
New Dad step in you can't stare
You know the power in a woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th & Ingleside
Feel like you can remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure they make the ring so tight

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

// A Bar About A Bar //

That's ten minutes
What you got?
Alright

I got a bar about a bar
It's not a joke, it's just a bar
A nigga walked into a bar
Took a seat, he like "This liquor hard, this woman easy"
Legend has it, he was callous, like fingers that pick guitars
He was just a, hit the park, his pickup truck, 'cause it was dark
To take a piss, the road was long, the line was long and shit
He thought about it, held it in and sipped his straw
Ashed out his cigar and walked out into his car
Forget that nigga, there was a line inside the bar
And the line was so long it wrapped behind the bar
And it, exposed moonshine and wine inside the jar
And it kept goin' to the alley and the trash behind the bar
To the same nigga, he was takin' a piss behind his car
The nigga in the front seen that this shit was out of order
The nigga in the back seen that the meters out of quarters
The patrons and the little wished this line was way shorter
I would tell you their names, but they names is unimportant

Is what I got so far

// All We Got (SBTRKT Remix) //

[Kanye West:]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

[Kanye West & The Chicago Children's Choir:]
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music, music is all we got

[Chance The Rapper:]
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!

It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third

[Kanye West:]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

[Chance The Rapper:]
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
'Cause at the end of the day

It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third

[Kanye West:]
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got

Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

// And They Say //

Huh
Nananananana nananananana
Ay, what they say?
Ay, what they say?
What they say?
And they say
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)
Nanananananananana
Na nananananananana (IGH, IGH!)
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)

I know the words (IGH, IGH, IGH!)
I know the words
Haven't you heard?
New album alert
This shit loud as the purp
We out in the burbs (huh)
Out of the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt, a mountain emerged
A willow was birthed
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it (IGH, IGH!)
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci
Just somethin' to say on it (huh, huh)
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney (huh)
My pop's in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofie (I ain't no goofie)
I ain't no goofie
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can't introduce me (who is you?)
This ain't a movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement

And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana

Man I ain't no lame (huh)
I know the game
I know my daddy (huh), you can tell when I speak I got his name (huh)
I'm on my business (I'm on my business)
I'm not in the business, I'm not a prisoner
I got my soul (I got my soul)
I flaunt, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hitters (I still got hitters)
Reese and Justin a phone call away
They say no delay, and ándale! they on the way
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Need a little scratch but the tours itch
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with you (huh, huh)
Ye ain't know open mics open doors did you? (huh)
I ain't no stain, I am for free
I am a promise, capital "P"

And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana

// Atlanta House Freestyle //

[Lil Yachty:]
Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat
(Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)

Fed up with niggas, they frontin' like loans
Fuckin' this model lil' bitch from the back (Skrrt)
In the tinted Maybach, almost broke all her bones
She don't do Backwoods, only do bones (Go)
Sometimes a cone if she out on the golf field
It was white like snow, it stood out at the show
I made 250 cash in three days on the low
I was out in L.A. walkin' 'round like the po'
Got a stick in the coat 'cause these niggas be on me
I love what I do, but this shit make you phony
I can't trust a soul 'less that boy really know me
You don't really know me, you hang 'round the homies
Shame in the game, no, I don't work for Sony
This ain't overnight, I move like politicians
Someone snatch my chain, they'll be hopin' and wishin'
My life is non-fiction, I sold out the Brixton
I shot a AK, that shit sound like a Braxton
On the west side where them boys really taxin'
(Go) Yep, (Go) yep
My newest bitch, she a work of art, I could sell her at an auction
Bought a new watch and that shit dipped in frostin'
I take the play, I'm Randy Moss-in
I am no weirdo

[Chance the Rapper (Lil Yachty) {Both}:]
{I am a Martian}
The play was a option
My tape was a caution
I coulda had plaques, I was too busy flossin'
Too busy crossin' the street, I got hits, I got drip like a faucet
This house is too little, it feel like a coffin
I go hit the club like the ball when I'm golfin'
I ball in the swamp with alligators
The house is too big, I got hella waiters
The nanny got stuck in the elevator
Just give me the key to the microwave
The safe is too big to hide the safe
The wave is too big to ride the wave
To ride the wave, to ride the wave (The wave)
I keep on all of my VVs in the shower
I'm blacker than Howard, I'm blacker than Morehouse
I'm blacker than Power
I'm blacker than black people watchin' Black-ish while they TiVo-ing Power
I'm back in Atlanta, I'm back at the house
I'm back at the crib, I'm back in the South
This all makin' sense like the back of the couch
You start actin' up, you get smacked in your mouth

[Lil Yachty:]
Smacked in your mouth by a nigga rockin' six rings
24 karat, all gold, like a young king
These niggas playin' both parts like Regina King
Dick in the spleen, turn the bitch 'to a young fiend
No limit, AmEx, I don't carry no cash
I don't fuck raw 'cause these hoes make me nut fast
Top of the year, tax came, I was too sad
Coulda built a whole middle school out in Trinidad
Funny guy probably goin' to hell 'cause he sin bad
Think like a billionaire, two-seater, tryna fit the whole VIP in there
Shouldn't even be in here, why it had to be in here, fuckin' up the seat in here
I don't take pills, got bills like a white man
Buyin' every whip, I ain't got time to finance
Life like a movie, I was born at the Sundance
Buddy actin' up, somebody come and get mans
I'ma take a bitch for a week to the villa
All-black ski mask gripped like a killa
New whip doin' doughnuts, J Dilla
Went to Panera, and a Panamera
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (Huh)
Black Rolls Royce like John Doe (Yeah)
Ayy, got him on the tip toes (Go)
Sit a little high like twenty floors

[Chance the Rapper (Lil Yachty):]
Sit a little high like nosebleed (Sit high)
Always ten toes like both feet (Sit high)
You come into to the room, make the hoes leave
I come into the room, make 'em holy
I run through the city like the red line
Young nigga 'bout to make headlines
Sun-Times facin' that deadline
Bout to start makin' up stories like bedtime
Old mayor 'bout to face fed time
Agin' like red wine, me, I'ma age like water
When it's all done, I'ma head to the Father (Mm)
'Til that day, take the Benz to the barber
Got a chop her off the top, got a date with your daughter (Yeah)
Your house not a home like Luther Vandross
You always outside like Superman's drawers
But get in that car, that little ass car
It's a little too far, can't Uber, can't walk
Good guy probably get in Heaven through the side door
Ridin' through the city on my high horse
Big, big TEC on my body like a cyborg
Leave you on a low note, leave you on a high court
I'm a lil' yachty on a big boat
Check the temperature like big tote
Got good aim with the sig
Got a major laser like Diplo

[Chance the Rapper:]
Heeeee
[Lil Yachty:]
Boat, Chance
Boat, Chance
Boat, Chance

Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys
Put you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly
Bought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli
Wake up real early but I eat late
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase
Time to shake down another cheap skate
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake

[Young Thug:]
Make a nigga bitch tap out
Then put 24's on a real big body
Bitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me
Can't fit in my pocket
I'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble
35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals

Puttin Caramel On garretts
Yellin "Fuck The Heat On Derrick"
I'm a city based N-word
27's, Port's and Spirit's
Been trying to Share that dinner
Can't Inherit from your Parents
#Igh
I was rollin a blunt when I wrote this
I was smoking a blunt when I spoke this
Hocus Pocus
Hows that for a smoke trick
Couldn't pay attention
Now I can afford focus
Got a lil Buzz and they got fuckin bogus
Like How you swat a flying locust?
But it's actually dope...
Acid, adderol and adjectives
An Adolescent I could fuck with?
#Igh's his fuckin Ad-lib?
Burn Burn
City we built
You already forgot the names
Of kids that we killed
Burn Burn
It's Hot as all fuck
Cause everyone got burner
Cause it's always gettin buck

// Child Of God //

Igh
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing

Truth be told, I got the ball on a string
Carried the weight of the world, but it came with some handles
I drag it to the basket, Moses with the passage
Safely Lord God, please make an example
I try to break shackles, now they ankles in shambles
I can't expect them to be grateful and thankful
They thought I had a manual like Hansel
Leave your plans in mans hands and it gets manhandled
Dancin' in the street, but I didn't panhandle
When I finally drop, make a pamphlet
Sell tickets, put that shit on FanDuel, OnlyFans and Fandango
Give me your ear like Van Gogh and it's candlewick
I mean, I mean, it's lit like a candlestick
When I'm fatigued like a camo fit
A rich man: the size of the needle that the camel fits
Walkin' to Jesus with my sandals wet

This world would make you second guess your first mind
Remember when it was your first day, the first time
It couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Just repeatin'

Do your thing, child (Do your thing, child)
Do your thing (That shit hit, hahahaha)
Just do your thing, child (Oh jeez)
Do your thing (Do your thing)

At every corner store, bodega, delicatessen
Stands a big head kid learning delicate lessons
Roasted for they clothes, or they emotions or they roaches
Bullied by they friends, or they mamas, or they coaches
Half size, chastised, dolls with glass eyes
Talk down, tossed down, the world just pass by
Grow up to be saviors, surgeons, rabbis
The world should've capsized when God got baptized
The boat don't sink, the show don't stop
The weapons form, the load don't drop
The boat gon' rock, the foes gon' plot
The rolls don't switch, the photo crop
The motto is "The more those hate, the more doors prop"
Open, the prince of Heaven was tempted
Told that he wasn't who he was, and they meant it
Never was there a path better cemented
So what they gon' say when you at the Olympics or tryna attempt it?

Remember when it was your first day, the first time
Couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Repeatin', it was sayin'

Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing

This world would make you second guess your first mind
Remember when it was your first day, the first time
It couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Just repeatin'

Do your thing, child
Do your thing (That shit hit!)
Just do your thing, child (Oh Jeez!)
Do your thing (Do your thing)

Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing

// Dear Theodosia (Reprise) //

[Chance The Rapper:]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile
You knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, I'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, I'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

[Francis and the Lights (Chance The Rapper):]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun, my son
And when you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I (was so smart)

[Chance The Rapper {Francis and the Lights} (both):]
(My father wasn't around)
My father wasn't around
{I swear that} (I'll be around for you)
{I'll do whatever it takes}
I'll make a million mistakes
{I'll make the} (world safe and sound for you...)

[Chance The Rapper (Francis and the Lights):]
Oooh (Oooh)
We'll bleed and fight for you (Oooh)
We'll make it right for you (Oooh)
(Whatever it takes)

If we lay a strong enough foundation (Ooh, so make)
We'll pass it on to you (The world safe and sound for you)
We'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away (Someday, someday
Someday, someday)

Someday
Someday (The world safe and sound)

Yeah you'll blow us all away (I'll make the world safe and sound)
(For you)

Someday
Oooh (Someday)
Someday	 (Someday)

We'll make the world safe and sound for you
Someday
You will know you're strong enough foundation
One day
Someday

// First World Problems //

[Chance The Rapper:]
I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
Thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winter spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door knocker
Down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father
You just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not (ready or not)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not, here it comes

[Chance The Rapper:]
Here it comes
Alright
Spirit's working now

I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass, send my tweet
Fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not (ready or not)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
(Here it comes)
(Ready or not, here it comes)

[Chance The Rapper:]
Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the scene snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin' 'til the dream happens
I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin'
Like Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin'
Knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings

Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
(Here it comes) ready or not, ready or not
(Ready or not) ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more (it's on its way, way, yeah)
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more (it won't wait, yeah)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it is

// Found You //

[Ludacris:]
Woo
God's creation
No filters, no imitation
Observations, consistent, you're amazin'
So fine, wishin' that you were mine, but that I'm quite patient
It's so divine, intelligent conversations
Stimulatin' your mind, where's my invitation?
I'd kill for the time to stop the clock
Pull up to your block, in a drop, would love your cooperation
Reserved a place in my heart, and I'm handlin' all accommodations
I'm so floored, you should win an award, for best spirit
I'm hearin' you got all my nominations, all in moderation
Takin' it slow but my mind racin', loosin' all my concentration
I'm spaced out but I'm readin' the signs
And when the stars align, you're my beautiful constellation

[Chance The Rapper:]
Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

[Ludacris:]
Ha, beautiful creature
Complex, over achiever
Nice to meet you, my antenna's tryna receive you
Your action, you're the special attraction
Lovin' all of your features
Get the picture?
Proverbs, 33:4, I'm caught in the scriptures
I found the fountain of youth, and you're the elixir
It's the truth and I promise to never mislead
One of the millions of fan in your arena
If you was a song then I would stream ya
If you was a novel then I would read ya
Over and over, what's the procedure to please ya?
Ha, you such a diva
Woman of my dream, I'm such a believer
My heart's tryna get in touch, let me reach you
I got food for your soul, let me feed you

[Chance The Rapper:]
Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Found you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

[Taylor Bennett:]
How you doing? It's Taylor Bennett, the famous rapper
I wanna take you out and maybe even party after
You can crash in, party, catch the morning after
Got booked over paper, that's another chapter
I wanna move to the hills where the breeze right
Know I like it when your pencil start to write
We gotta get it on the dance floor tonight
Baby, I'm a smooth surfer, baby, I'm a you type
Focused on my future, line up reality
Mind of a different galaxy
Mama said eat your vegetables, celery turns to salary
Selling souls while I'm only addicted to forms of casualty
Casualty is a tragedy
Young cause of catastrophe, drop one, moving galleries
Evil is just a half of me
Greatest grace, my anatomy
Adam and Eve's apple in me, probably screaming feel 'em
Thank God for the trade I, for the way I
Roll up in a bimmer, hold up, slick nigga
Moving that weight, fit nigga, guap, guap
Rich nigga, doper than dope
I got bricks in the side of my watch cause my wrist killing
Niggas be tweaking, I'm tweaking them out
So why I'm the nigga you tweeting about?
Trashy ass rappers, I'm cleaning them out
See, be the reason my phone ringing out
Give me a call about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all

// Grown Ass Kid //

[Mick Jenkins:]
Fuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
With dream, no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like

[Arima Ederra:]
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way up, you steady talking that shit
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...

[Chance the Rapper:]
Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL
Ay be clear, this my daddy house, you just the uncle from ATL
(Better take out that trash)
Boy get your big....grown ass on
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, get that bass out your voice, you were sounding like Tone Lōc
Now watch how I move, different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud, "My favorite rapper a Christian rapper"
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha' mean?

[Arima Ederra:]
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib

Boy you just a...

[Alex Wiley:]
Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely, mad, nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words, wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting, I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day, I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers
I tell 'em "When you dream, make sure that you dream big"
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects

[Ha Ha Davis:]
Get up off that bed, big fella
You a grown boy, big fella
You need your diaper change, big fella
You still catching a bus nigga and living at mom's crib, big fella
You been tryna get money
You only got ten singles in your pocket, big fella
Get up now, big fella, find you a job
Still playing Xbox 360, you ain't even got an Xbox One
You got a PS one and an Xbox 360, big fella
Go find you a job, today, right now, big fella
The sun is almost gone, big fella
Get up now, big fella
(...playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...)
Get up, big fella
What is you doing?
You been sleeping all day, big fella
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed, big fella
It's time to find another hustle, big fella
That scamming ain't cutting it, big fella
Get up now
Get up, get up, get up, big fella

IGH!
Nana naaaaa
Yup
Oooh!

[Verse 1:]
Young black boy
How he got the labels scared?
A&R's like "Chano, you ain't playin fair!"
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position
I be like, naw, these my sons this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than ableton
Make a plate and make it player
Make em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens 'fore your eggs or eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer
IGH!

Back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this thaaang
I'm back up in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch
Back up in this bitch
Get it crackin' in this bitch
I'm back up in this bitch

[Verse 2:]
Young tactician
Just got my taxes finished
Beat the tortoise by a hair
In an '04 Ford Taurus
On a spare with a wax finish
Theres a lot of metaphors, you just lack vision
You just bad business
UH!
All your shit been lower case
Lower class, lower key
I'm the only minor minority in priority
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority
Author of my horoscope, feeling like the oracle
Ain't no rules, nigga

// I Ain't Word //

[Hook: Detail (Chance)]
You can look me in my face
I ain't got no worries (I ain't word) [x3]
See them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries (I ain't word) [x3]
You see money right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
Yeah that's (me) right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there
We ain't got no worries

[Verse 1:]
D. Rose on that ass
That means back again
I hit my Zan so hard
Man, I've been practicing
I'm going straight to the league
And not by accident
Don't get your ass kicked in
I hoop in Shaq's and Timbs
Chit chat with Chris Mintz-Plasse
And laugh at Jags and rims
T-T-Y-L-ing the labels
And L-O-L-ing their friends
Hello Hell and Heaven
You haven't heard the half of it
Have at it half happy
30-something-year old
Broke graduate
Over the wave like Du-rags
Getting paper like dude rap
19 making that
I could be damn near fucking Erykah Badu rap
Girbaud flow is too strapped
My screws loose, I'm too slapped
Just got this bitch too turnt
Just got my nose 2Pac'd
L.A Reid like whose that
Jimmy Iovine like whose that
Whole world like whose that
Whole hood like 'dude ass'
I'm from little shorties with the shot up shirt
Where babies get kilt like a Scottish skirt
95-ing down the Ryan
And I'm flying, skirt
Keep asking if I'm trying
Nigga, I ain't word

[Verse 2:]
Unreluctant optimist
Most poppingest
Got popular
Try topping this
Triceratops
BJs from baby bopping bitches
Throat lozenges
Massaging it
No touching it
Okay, touch on it
But don't rush on it
Ration it, passionate
While imagining me
Smashing it
Dash out at like 4: 30
Hands smelling like potpourri
They ain't gettin hung
My nigga, no jury
So I don't give no nigga no mercy
When my little fucking brother rap better than you
My shit get's your girl way wetter than you
You rap veterans you
My nerdy brethren you
Stuff you in a fuckin locker, 10 day letterman you
You wanna jock me, jockers (AAH)
My style's fathering you
I know it's bothering you
Probably an anomaly
But it's probably niggas that's probably starving for new
Shit you could sound like
That's that shit that I don't like
But I ain't really worried
I'm a wordy motherfucker
I could hurry
But I'm buried in her pussy from the last tape

Cold pizza with the hot Sriracha tonight
Apple TV, Comcast, don't know what to watch-a tonight
Shoulda had ya when I had ya, now I wish I gotcha tonight

[Hook x2:]
You can hit my line
If you ain't on shit, if you tryna smoke

[Verse 2:]
I guess I'll file the cabinets, fix the disha washa, tonight (lot of activities)
Feed the fishes twist a swisha while I mix the pasta tonight (multitasking)
Tube socks white briefs gold wrista watcha tonight (fancy attire)
On the sofa posted perfect selfie picture posture tonight (Snapchat bitch)

Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you

Yep, now now
Nah nah, no

I ain't no activist, I'm the protagonist
I don't co-captain it, I fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
The cab is the cabinet, they trust me at landing it
They call me the advocate, they'll slide like the abacus
Boy meets world, everybody been savages
I just want to really know how much a drill shooter averages
I'm not no nice guy I'm just a good guy
The bad guys should really stay on my good side
I smell my roses younger than the good die
The Illuminati couldn't see me with they good eye
They think they Heath Ledger scary, they just Jack Nichols
I'm a sign to my city like the Bat-Signal
Young chosen one, golden boy, De La Hoya
It ain't too many me's, rest in peace to Verne Troyer
I was younger then I seemed as a kid
I mean my G17 18 in the head
I mean I'm only 25 but I'm Motown 25
Bet I get a statue in my hometown when I die
And Rahm you done I'm expectin' resignation
An open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers

Fuck you, oh o-o-oh
Fuck you, fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck you, fuck you-ou-ou
Fu-fu-fu-fu fu, fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fu
Fuck you, oh o-o-oh

Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you

I don't get no paper I gotta sign at the bottom
Still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
And I can't do nothing right, they gon' always be at me
I missed a Cranes interview, they tried leaking my addy
I donate to the schools next, they call me a deadbeat daddy
But Sun-Times get in that Rauner business
I got a hit-list so long I don't know how to finish
I bought the Chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
Speaking of racist, fuck your micro aggressions
I'll make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
Pat me on the back too hard and Pat'll ask for your job
And in unrelated news, someone'll beat your ass at your job
I'm the real deal
Who taught all these rappers that a big deal's not a big deal?
Inherited the earth, popped them wheelies on a big wheel
My enemy lives in his mother's basement
That's why my videos don't got no bathroom and product placement
I'm a real one
The honey is sweet, the apple's bitter
They'll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
And tell you they kidding while Twitter trashing your litter
I know the devil's a liar
I know that players is quitters, I heard you hire your hitters
I know the higher the bidder, that mean the less on return
So I just hire a sitter
I'm not no boss nigga, I'm a soldier
Kingdom builder, man somebody shoulda told ya
Fuck you

Fuck you, fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you
Fu-u-u-u-u-uck, fuck fuck you

// I Was A Rock //

"I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from boxing?"
"I really don't know, I want to say something right here this might make you all think.
When I get out of Boxing or when I'm through, I want to do all I can to help people.
What's the best thing I can do? Get ready to meet God."

Back in time
I lost track of time
Rolling on the road
Christmas Eves and Valentines
Seemed like the days before
I came I went I did well
I did I really meant well
But I almost missed my beat
So thank you for saving me a seat

I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no where better, better

God is watching me
God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America
As far as wealth
It's all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other
How do we help each other

I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock

Steady hold
I've grown weary and old
We're as close as we'll ever be
I was gone I had places to be
And of course you're in the last place I look

I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no one better, better

And I'm still standing here
Standing still
I won't be moved
How used to do when

I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock (I was a rock)
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day (Back in my day)
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock

// Israel (Sparring) //

[Chance The Rapper:]
Sparring is training
Chain snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one temptation that had Otis' back
Sparring is training this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumber jack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor
Card cracker, sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated, waited, waited
You still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
"Wake up, wake up" like remember me?
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies

[Noname Gypsy:]
Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, non religious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D
But bet I sting, no die

[Chance The Rapper & Noname Gypsy:]
Sparring is training

[Chance The Rapper:]
Jacob wrestled with God, in the desert 'til he broke him
And he blessed him and he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

[Noname Gypsy (Chance The Rapper):]
You giving back?
(I'm giving back)
Tit for tat

[Noname Gypsy:]
Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum

[Chance The Rapper & Noname Gypsy:]
Excuse them, they know of what they do

[Chance The Rapper:]
Sparring is training,don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be onnat elegant hella melanin
Pelle Pelle's since they crayons and jelly pens

[Chance The Rapper (Noname Gypsy):]
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
(Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none)
Aha, and you don't stop
Boom bap, and you don't stop
I told you that was gonna be fun though

// Lady Friend //

I've got a lady, a lady friend
I've got a lady friend
I've got a lady and that lady is my
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady
And that lady is my friend
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend

I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya?
Will I always call ya back?
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Imaginary beneficiary been away for so long Ben & Jerry friend
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you, "What's up with your lady?"
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just, you're just gorgeous"
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend

For a friend, for a friend
What would you do?
For for a friend
What would you do for a friend?

// Living Single //

[Big Sean:]
Uh, yeah, look

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying "Hi Britney" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls
Pussy get wet as an s-curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like "I got some hoes, hit me back" Fuck it

[Jeremih:]
Oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Jeremih & Smino:]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl

[Chance The Rapper:]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it cause simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Jeremih:]
Yeah, oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Jeremih & Smino:]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl

[Smino:]
Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismol, peel
Teen named Cali, that ass on sunset hill
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on her, real
And you would be too, I'm pookie about that coochie, for real
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up
Arch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin
Living la vida with my little Vita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She said "Smino boy I get it all ready"

[Jeremih & Smino:]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl

Bad little bitty in the city that I'm in (Yeah)

// My Peak //

[Future:]
Yeah, gotta believe us
Super

Head full of smoke
Body full of ink
I don't measure it no more, I pour it 'til it's pink
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seats
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak, no
I ain't barely reach my peak
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seats (whoa)
I ain't barely reach my peak, no

I don't wanna hear about no masters (no, no)

They gon' point to Cuba when I pass away
I probably still be ballin' on my Cast Away
I just got a text that say keep goin' (alright, alright)
I just got a check that say keep goin'
Hurricane Jericho, born-bred Crane mode
Everything player code, phone airplane mode (alright alright)
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the devil, you don't fuck with me
I'ma keep makin', I make extra payments
I'm a free agent like the second Matrix
I'mma make them nations deal us reparations
Been dancing round the town like I was Kevin Bacon

Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the feds, you don't fuck with me

Call up L.A. Reid and tell his ass it's time to run it up
Doin' all this countin' my own I need some new thumbs
I heard they say they gon' do something to me, tell 'em "do something"
Live nation checks with my name give me goosebumps
I'll book a flight for your girl and make your boo cum
Slide on the prey in a day and make the news come
I had a few fights for my life and I ain't lose one
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
When I'm with your spouse, she gon' cum for me
You don't want no problems, they go down for me
We can ball and kick it, come and pump with me, ah

// Nike: Unlimited Together //

[Chance The Rapper:]
We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks
Bombs bursting in air
Oh say
Can you see America's face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some more for us
Save the date
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate

People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side

I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait

I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus

// Save Yourself First //

[James Blake:]
Love is the life 'round here
We're never done

Part time love

[Chance the Rapper:]
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute
The sand just dropped for the last time
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute
Darkness been swallowed it up
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But here ain't been round a whole lot
My flesh looked through the peephole
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Life can't be here, indefinite
Not another minute 'round here
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?
But wear that fake smile like a cape
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first

// See Me Fly //

Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly

Where I'm from, you learn to walk rocking ankle weights
The dirt road for us ran about his ankle brace
Was getting chased down block for a bunch of reasons
If you was learning how to fly, then it was hunting season
And if you learning how to try, then it was try and cheat them
My momma seen it, said, "Boy, you better" (And I'm gonna take this shot)
You ain't gotta knock 'em out before you gotta beat them (Risk it all against the fall)
You better look at every shot like it's your shot at freedom
Now fast forward, the kid is the king
Championship so big the box fit in the ring
They make 'em fantasize match ups who could in his prime
I could shoot from the logo with my foot on the line
That mean my shoes too big to fill
Future on free bands, my presence on the court like my past keep replaying
My wingspan longer than the message at the bottom of CSPAN
Just a kid who played Heat fans and Cleveland for real

Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly
Look at the sky up where the clouds at
The air up here is so clear we clearly on top
From out under me if you want to see me fly
We built this thing from where the ground's at
It's our time to take flight we're cleared for take off
From out under me if you want to see me fly

Yeah, it's game time now, we gotta jump it like the tip off
Whole city been waiting on me prepare for lift off
Never cheat the process there's some you can't rip off
Made it through the struggle and prosper through every pitfall
I can't sleep, walked in with game seven energy
The gang three, I come from the Bay, boy, I killin' it no more game

And I'm gonna take this shot, risk it all against the fall
If they can't hold me, can't block me
I'm up on this nonstop
Not earthbound, no, can't lift it, love, silk shot, yeah, no limit
Yeah, if they can't hold me, can't block me
I'm not stoppin', no
You can try to keep me down
Pull the ground out from me now if you want to see me fly

Pull the ground from out under me if you want to see me fly
Look at the sky up where the clouds at
The air up here is so clear we clearly on top
From out under me if you want to see me fly
We built this thing from where the ground's at
It's our time to take flight we're cleared for take off
From out under me if you want to see me fly

// Somewhere In Paradise //

[Jeremih:]
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Chance The Rapper:]
Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood
Sin of the children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm saving my city, say I'm staying for good
They screaming Chano for mayor, I'm thinking maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em bitch I can't wife you
Told your ass since day one, I don't like like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, along with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive, I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance now pass it to A-Rap
I should have rhymed it with rhyme ain't we been here before
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes...

[Chance The Rapper:]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Riding on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it, God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church but I need a choir

[Jeremih:]
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

[Chance The Rapper:]
Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers, think my teachers need features
I think I'm walking with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been tripping and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey, but I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli, how 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worrying over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question with some questions questioning yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this morning
I woke up this morning
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this morning

[Chance The Rapper:]
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Riding on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it, God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church but I need a choir

[R. Kelly:]
I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all, there's a paradise (there is a paradise)
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise

// Somewhere, Nowhere, USA //

I'm in the middle of nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
And I'm just looking for somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Yeah, you like that, how I did my own echo cause no one else can do me but me cause I'm the best though
I'm a bag of kush, you're bagged oregano
And I've been this way from the get-go, get low
Mistaking me for him is like geico for geco
When they replace me for me money and some background techno
Anyways so I don't toy with kids just to let know
And all y'all still playing on the blocks need to let go
Difference between us, lies in genetic make up
X-y chronology, body mass, make-up
At night I sleep, all night you stay up 
You're afraid of nightmares, I'm afraid to wake up
And I tell my girl I love her every time I see her 
Cause I'm afraid tomorrow that I might not be here
Cause sometimes my wrist whispers "slit us,
And we'll wisp ya to the other side of wisdom"
Just jump off the tip of the worlds tallest building
Fall on the tracks in a plane that you tripped up or slip up
Pop pills blame it was a mix up
"oh the box said 2-4, coulda swore that it read 24"
Damn Chance you coulda died if you popped anymore
Damn, just 1 more coulda let me go where 
Maybe god intended me to grow here
Damn Chano, keep spacing off I swear you so weird
You're afraid of somewhere, I'm content with nowhere

[Hook:]
Somewhere, nowhere, USA
Aye aye aye aye
Somewhere, nowhere USA
Aye aye
Somewhere, nowhere

You can go to somewhere to nowhere by trolley from Maui to Mali
Mexican tamales on the border
And Milan between crazy and depressed
Maybe I'm just stressed cause my damsel's not undressed
And her knight in shining armor is searching for martyr 
Like playing a game of operation with Parkinson's 
You touched the walls and you felt shocked
Cause when you touched the walls 
You felt boxed
Nowhere is vast and somewhere is compressed 
And my dreams need room to stretch out its legs
And it can run around for miles when its with itself
With even more stride than the gum itself
I feel my sanity is picking on my fantasies
And reality is pulling out the man in me 
But drive, could give a shit about your asthma 
Just kick you in the ass and tell you to run faster
And some weeks have passed since I last seen my pastor
And let him tell me I don't get anything I ask for
God'll give you wings if you stop being a bastard 
I guess I'll go to nowhere I don't need to pass but…

[Hook]

// Sunday Candy //

[Chance the Rapper:]
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers.
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers,
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor.
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma!
Mines is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide.
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club,
Santa, something told me I should bring my butt to church!

[Hook 2x - Jamila Woods:]
You gotta move it slowly,
Take and eat my body like it's holy.
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy.

[Bridge - Jamila Woods:]
Come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain.
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.
You better come on in this house, 'cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.

[Chance the Rapper:]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth.
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you.
You look so good with a hat on, had to match with the shoes,
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew.
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place.
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like, light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
And his praise is daily basis so I gotta try it.
You're my dream catcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute, lemme take my butt to church!

[Bridge 2x:]
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).
You better come on in this house (come on in this house),
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain)
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain.

[Hook 2x:]
You gotta move it slowly,
Take and eat my body like it's holy.
I've been waiting for you for the whole week,
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.

Slowly. Take and eat my body like it's holy.
I've been waiting for you for the whole week.
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday, candy.

[Bridge 2x:]
You better come on in this house (come on in this house)
'Cause it's gonna rain (it's gonna rain).
Rain down Zion (rain down), it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house,
'Cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain.

// The Heart & The Tongue //

My heart and tongue are fighting, my mind is undecided
It's not like Trump and Biden, it's more like it's something private
Like when your cousins fighting, one of 'em get excited
You can't just jump the gun and pick a side and jump inside it
Remember, Pontius Pilate hung a God and justified it
The truth is slow 'cause someone's always in a rush to hide it
The lies is golden 'cause the Devil got a touch of Midas
The soul is brighter 'cause the Holy Ghost is ultraviolet
The tongue is violent when the spirit starts to hunger-striking
The thunder lightning makes the heart go under bunkers hiding
The lungs is silent when it hears the footsteps of the giants
And then, the fingertips, they twist up like Poseidon's trident
Remember safety if you ever running from the tight end
Remember Mookie if they ever come to cut the hydrant
They cut the heart out with the tongue, they want it undivided
You better not start, you make a fuss you end up uninvited

My heart and mind are beefing, I call 'em "rhyme and reason"
They always going head to head, I'm trying to Siamese 'em
My father got a special set of skills like Liam Neeson
He told me faith and squinted eyes can turn the blind Venetian
I seen the sign, I'm in the den, I'm with the lions sleeping
I seen the wine, I seen the water turn to bright Tahitian
The heart is somewhere on Hawaiian beaches
Tying pigeons to the giant peaches
I want the beat to feel like diegesis
I'm tired of politicians tryna sell us diet Jesus
That's like dialysis was tryna sell us diabetes
Act like you was born yesterday and you gon' die a fetus
The mind's philosophy is old as Thales of Miletus
The mind is quite elitist, that's why they like choir preachers
They buy our leaders easier than I can buy a feature
That's why the genius always end up on the tightest leashes
That's how I wrote my whole entire thesis
My heart and flesh are racing, that's why I get complacent
That's why y'all get impatient, y'all don't get the invitation
I'm sitting courtside with the nurses during visitation
Watching the vitals with some popcorn in anticipation

// The Highs & The Lows //

The highs and the lows
The highs, the lows

I'm an emotional rollercoaster (Ah)
With highs so high, could put Bol Bol on a poster (Mm)
But when the bread get low like four loaves in a toaster
Or the shoulders can get cold as ten toes in Nova Scotia
Some days I hold a grudge, some days I Holy Ghost her
Some days I just ghost her, some days I'm supposed to
The crib feel like a gunfight, but them strollers, that's the holster (Huh)
We can make amends over old memes and mimosas
My mama know I ain't make my bed, but I'ma lay in it
Whether it's sandpaper, suede linen
Whether I'm alone or Creole lady marmalade-ing it
The same pajamas I was afraid in, I boogeyman slayed
My blankets concealed my blade in it, emotional seesaw
With two fat motherfuckers with strong knees in free fall (Huh)
It's cloudy with a chance of meatballs, I checked the weather
I gave all my vices a call, let's get together

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs
No need to hide disguises comin' down
Go and get high, I promise you're comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down, comin' down

When it's hard to keep your eyes on the road (Eyes on the road)
And you feel your back's on the ropes (With your backs against the ropes)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (Yeah, yeah)
You're lost and you're runnin' out of hope (You're runnin' out of hope)
Lookin' for the best way to cope (For the best ways to cope)
Just know we all been there before (We all been there)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (Badmon)

I was feelin' lifeless, I had to cut my vices (I had to)
Now the feelin' that I feel is priceless
In the spirit, want me to be righteous
But I know I might just relapse, get sucked in these devices
Got so used to feedback, I couldn't tell what mines is (Word)
Sometimes all the outside noise just really blinds us
Beware (Facts), believe none of what you see and half of what you hear (Right)
The best things in life on the opposite side of fear
I swear I see it clear, like after the storm
Still, you can't stop the rain like the Loose Ends' song
My word is bond like James, yo, I couldn't complain (Nah)
'Cause even when I did, niggas really couldn't feel my pain (Uh)
That's the type of shit to drive a nigga insane
Wanna be numb, now your thumb back flickin' the flame
Back to square one, tryna overcome what you became
Like they was right, I guess you're never gon' change, I guess you never gon'

When it's hard to keep your eyes on the road (Your eyes on the road)
You start to feel your back on the ropes (Your back 'gainst the ropes)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)
You're lost and you're runnin' out of hope (And you're runnin' out of hope)
And you lookin' for the best way to cope (The best way to cope)
Just know we all been there before (We all been there)
You gotta take the highs with the lows (The highs with the lows)

To talk about the highs and lows, the ups and downs
The friends that I had to hide to come around
They told me that I knew you'd always come around
Come around, come around, come around, come around
To work out the highs and lows, the ups and downs (The ups and downs)
No need to hide disguises comin' down (Comin' down)
Go and get high, I promise you're comin' down
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down, comin' down

Buck, buck, buck, brr, Chano
Chance The Rapper, Josif Badmon (Yes, yes)
You done know this
Big up to the youth dem
All the youth dem worldwide (All the youth dem are the truth dem)
Yes, and the most high, praise the most high
Chano
Fuck Mussolini with his dead ass
Fuck, fuck, fuck

// The Man Who Has Everything //

What to get the man who has everything?
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
Tryna eat everything
I was raised, it come across my plate then I better swing
Tryna turn confederate flags into confetti strings
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
Never leave where I came from
I just need me some stockings and the chimney they could hang from
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
Christmas cards so gorgeous other families wanna frame one
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
Well, we'll keep the elevator

Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
Which is 'bout as common as free Blacks
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
And once the debris drops, the streets 400 degrees hot
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
What in the world for the man who has everything?
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
He never ring

Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
That's all I ask
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

That baby is a genius
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
I swear it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, "Damn, that boy soft"
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
It's been a minute since I've seen her
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
But like the Christmas tape there's things that I gotta get clear
Like my papa ask the same question every year
"What to get for my boy who has everything?"
I said, "I'll take anything but everything," you know?

Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

// The Writer //

[Intro:]
Niggas try to come at me and shit like
On some like, I only write slow songs
And I only write...church and
How many of y'all are fucking with me with a pen, period?

[Verse 1:]
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But whats writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me stay the fuck out my mouth
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud
A false poet get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap wrapped in cigarillo
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
But this is for the day that your dad dies
Puffin' some reason all you hearing is sad sighs
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dads like
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write, nothing
This is for those who wrote suicide notes
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope
Nothing, life is but a supersized note
I open up my mind like suicide door
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote I hope

[Bridge: Chance the Rapper]
It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start

[Hook: Chance the Rapper and Guests (2X)]
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper (4X)]
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'mma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing

// Work Out //

[Chance The Rapper:]
Today I miss my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
Send my love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out

Luckily, my ex uh-guh-ly
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her "give it a rest," so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess, I must confess
For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out

Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peaks
And bears his face, and doesn't it get so hard to breathe
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
With nothing left to give, with nothing left to say
For no one says their wrongs, or sets the record straight

[Francis and the Lights & Chance The Rapper:]
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
That shit must hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe (whew)
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always workout when you hand it to G

[Chance The Rapper:]
Today I miss my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
Send my love on they mama, I hope it works out
I hope it works out

I believe in long distant love, God that's above, bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald headed-
Y'all Interrupt
You all in a rush
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the up-per room
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show, we can re-bump into em'
Maybe we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the broom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume the position is filled
I was read' since the womb
I was not made for this, this was made for me
And it's gonna work out

Today I miss my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
Ima have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
Send my love on they mama, I hope it works out
I hope it works out

[Vic Mensa:]
My name like the Rangers, I write in Stone
Chano my nigga, he right or he wrong
Stars in the roof it's a, aye, yeah
It's a war zone at home
Aye, this shit don't make no sense
Pullin' up in that spaceship, yeah

My name like the Rangers, I write in Stone
Chano my nigga, he right or he wrong
Stars in the roof it's a it's a war zone at home
I swear this shit feel like Attack of the Clones
Father them niggas, I gave 'em they sound
It might've worked out if I wrote 'em they songs
One of one Kerby, I got this sown
My fist in the air like the back of my comb
Over they head like a shot with a drone
Securus calls puttin' money on phone
Mom ask me when I'm coming back home
I said I'd be down, a benefit to you to have me around
This rap shit got slow went and got me a pound, that Towkio grown
TMZsocio, why they so nosy though?
These niggas lyin' I call 'em Pinocchio, aye
You know this ain't my first rodeo
He caught two shots, I call that shit a doppio
My niggas poppin', so don't try the oki-doke
They with the six, they ain't on OVO
I'm on the 5 gettin' Peso with Curry Moe
Yeah, you know my story though

[Chanace The Rapper:]
Pick up the pace if I pick up the phone
She acting up, I start actin' along
Wake up one morning and that bitch gone
We not in Kansas, Patrick Mahomes
Over the rainbow and back in the two flat, the witches is too flat
They shattered bones
The house is too heavy
The wrist is too heavy
My brother a heavy
He stackin' the Stone
Savemoney marrow it's back in my bones
I'm back in the 'Yo like it's back in the day
My city a riot I go on a diet
But if I keep eating they'll have a parade
I'm on the 9 I'm having a Wraith
If I got the Bentley we havin' a race
I'm slammin' the jakes and stackin' the rakes
We going in prisons and openin' gates
Closing the precinct and open the case
I'm cracking the code, open the safe
My brothers my sisters I sat and thought
And flew in a rush and soaked in lake
People scattered the leaders was flattered
And hidden in neo-colonial states
You cannot get out this by owning a school
You cannot get out this by owning the place
Body the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the head
I'm part of the body, I'm part of the problem
I'm a part of my body
I'm parting the red
Body the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the body, the head
The sea get too choppy
The people get wocky and Israel's salty the water is dead

[Vic Mensa:]
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Got me ballin' like Irving
And the world keep turnin'
In a suburban, I'm swervin'
And she slurpin' the bourbon
And I'm smokin' on Durbin
And my motor a German
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Bob Marley, I'm burnin'
Got me ballin' like Irving
And the world keep turnin'
In a suburban, I'm swervin'
And she slurpin' the bourbon

// Writing Exercise #2 //

Writing exercise number two
Write from your most creative self

The fable unfolds, the prin-
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh

The fable unfolds, the prince is coronated at home
Foreign states sent robes ornated in gold
The poor fated sore losers all hated their roles
They played it perfectly, I couldn't make it alone
My city, my throne, my chair is the bean, my lair my home
And fair is the queen, it ain't fair, I inherited liens
But my house stands straight, I'm the sturdiest beam
Heavy the crown but steady the vision
Eyes wide open, ears stay ready to listen
The petty decisions I left at the city's discretion
Skyscrapers are the throne on which I stand
I'm the African man, I stand on sovereign land
The spaceship is quite heavy so it rock when it land
A rocket ship is just a boat that takes off at a slant
I need a co-signer for a ocean liner again
Got a crew and a plan we can go dock at the sand
Look for a sign, I'm in between the line and the tan
At the closest point again, we'll be back here again
At the closest point again, we'll be back here again

// Yah Know //

Know, know, know, how will I? (Sɛ wo nim dada)
How will I know, know, know, know (King Promise ni Chance the Rapper)
Know, know, know, how will I know?
How will I know?

You'll know when ya get there
Yah know when I end up on a new track
You'll go when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when ya go

Gun to ya back like Harriet
If you can't shoot, can't carry it
If ya too fake, can't ferry it
Come carry me home, sweet chariot
Er'body wanna come drive the boat
But nobody wanna come paddleboat
If we realized we was all compatible
We could combine the money
Maybe come buy the boat
Sometime, gun might bust
Sometime, gun might bust (Bust)
Freedom is a must, in Yah we trust
Hold my hand if you scared, hold my hand if you cried
Hold my hand and I'll drive, close your eyes and I'll steer
I'm not woke, I'm just tired
I'm not floatin', I'm flyin'
I'm not broken, I'm fine
I'm outspoken, I stay on code when I'm out in the open online
They gon' know what we know in no time
They gon' go in the show with no line
With a pick for a comb, the clothes, the whole 9
Better hold on tight, no time to slow down
Don't ask, "Are we there?", you slept the whole time

You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know, go
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know, you'll know
You'll know when we get there, you'll know when we get there
You'll know, you'll know
You'll see it, you'll see it
You'll see it

Front to the back, get loud
Ones in the back, get loud
Run and the gun click, pow
One big crowd (One big crowd)
One big smile (One big smile)
Money in one big pile
Blueprints in an unzipped file
Akwaaba, medaase
That's the end of my speech
Tell 'em, "Spread the word from Osu to Kumasi"
This for Dr. Kwame, Selassie and Nnamdi
Tell 'em, "Free the youth, or we gon' free the army"
Pray no man can harm me, can't no man can harm me
I can't let you starve me, I can't go out like Gandhi
Bet, say less, bro, we on the way
Starline Fest, hoe, we on the way
Better open that whole damn street on the way
'Fore it look like World War Z on the gate

You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there (You'll know, you'll know, you'll know, you'll know)
We almost there, we almost down, it's almost now

Let me take y'all back like Marcus
When Europe was still in the darkness
Our boats was big as the ark is
The cargo was gold-tip spears, and it sold by the load, and it opened the market
Before currency, the Canary Current made trade, and maize was the harvest
Back to the wall like the art is
I lean on the crib like the mortgage
I breathe on the game like a cartridge
I'm sorry, I ain't mean to restart it
Chano got the keys to the starship
With his heart on his sleeve like a card trick
Goin' back to the sea like a warship
Then I'm back to the sand like a starfish
Now lil' mama, you don't always have to hit the streets
We must fight, but you must fight to go protect your peace
And I'm gon ride, but when you ride with me, you'll get some sleep
And we gon' mob, but when we mob, it'll be lil' more discreet

You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
(You'll know when we get there)
You'll know when we get there
Let me say
Leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'
We gon' leave in the mornin'

At the break of dawn, we gon' make a break
We gon' take the farm
Take the safe, we finna break the bank
We replaced the tapes, and made fake alarms
The home team waitin', know we comin' over
Got a Sauvignon blanc with the two cigars
'Case you was stoppin' to loot the bar
We got valet waitin' with a souped-up car
Got a nitro boost for the chasin'
Got a few rooms booked at the Days Inn
Got a lil' bit of Mase and a lil' bit of cash
Just in case, catch a glimpse of the faces
Good God, this the heist for the ages
From the cages, straight to the majors
Liberation, you gotta take it
Free yourself, learned that from the Haitians
Smile through the tears, learned that from a crocodile
Speak your mind like a pocket dial
Got fully-auto rocket power
So any damn door, it'll knock it down
Just call my phone when you make it down
Just give me a piece when you break it down
Cullinan Diamond, when I take the crown
'Cause when I take the crown, I'ma break the crown
You'll know when I get there

I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know we will get there (You'll know)
I don't wanna think too much, don't wanna think about it
But I know you'll get there, yeah

You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there (How would I know?)
You'll know when we get there

Got you stressed ripping yo fro up
Smokin squares fuckin your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya
They critically acclaiming
Used to criticize your mistakes
Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape
A misogynistic mischief
You the reason for the mishaps
You should keep coming up missing
You're a Top Dog
You the top dog
They can't even catch up
You so hot-dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you win a grammy or if you end up in the hall of rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top

[Singing:]
Got 99 problems. Got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse but you know I don't give a fuck. YOLO!

[Hook:]
Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
YOLO [x5]

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Shouts out my Juice, bitch
My cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick igh
Bitch suck my dack
I been riding around in that steamer
With that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck
But now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success?
What do you think of fuck fest!
You ever had a four-some?
You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out?
You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped and bumping Ye could make it be OK
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go away
I been up inside the stu' for fuckin' 3 whole days
Yellin fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box
Somebody pour me another shot
Like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
Drop, Drop, Drop, Drop
Give a fuck... Fuck That, That
Is you Going, dot, dot, dot? like a lot, lot, lot, lot
Do the fop, bop, bop, bop, Don't Stop, Stop, Stop, Stop
Who gon' stop me?

[Hook]

// You A Bitch //

[Intro - AZ + (Nas):]
Aiyo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)

[Hook - Chance The Rapper:]
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You's a bitch
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch
You a bitch

[Verse 1 - Towkio:]
Love or her not
As long as she run through your thots
Then she the best that you got
Focused on tying the knot
Or the run down, come up, I keep it on lock
Bitch
Fuckin' deuce, bitch

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
Who is you, is you the same?
You'se a lame
I'm you shit you'se a nuisance
Lose your life when I told you that you should hang
You should beg
You should beg with chasers
Stop chasin' Chance
I be takin' chances when I be tryna blaze a dance
Raise a man
Thumbin' through like lasers when I laser beam
You'se a fuckin' loser and you chase it with some [?]
I need me some magic beans and a fuckin' stalker
So I could climb that bitch to the top of mount of lava
And the whole damn parkin' lot
But it be ridin', it be ridin' all my niggas just like Dennis
They be robbin', they be Rodman
I'm comin' through it pimpin'
I be pimpin', I be drippin' when I'm off the fuckin' acid
And that

[Verse 3 - Kami De Chukwu:]
Me I'm a pimp
All in your crib
With your bitch
Watchin' Netflix
Bet that I hit
She ask where you at me
I tell her don't trip
I tell her don't trip
Like hope you gettin' a hint
Hope you gettin' a hint
Or feelin' the rain
God damn motherfucker no gin
Let me hit

[Outro:]
We're not against rap, we're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs
