Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Let me bang
Bang it

I like a freaky bitch that don't talk when she pillow talk
I just wanna bang, that's enough
Know she got a nigga but that ain't my nigga
And she got her ass, but damn, her body thicker
Tryna bang, what's your name?
Tryna drank, what you drank?
I got some plans to break your back and break the bank

I'm tryna (Hit it from the back, hit it from the back, let me bang)
Come here (Let me bang)
Come here (Let me bang)
(Let me bang)
(Bang it)

I need a ride or die to spell her name on top of me
When she need a break she just start toppin' me
I'm like, "Hol' on, baby, let me put in work"
But she don't want no work, she start to pull my shirt
She let me bang (She let me bang)
Shake the frame (Shake the frame)
If you can hang (If you can hang)
I'll make it rain (I'll make it rain)
She throw it back, she make it clap, she not no lame (Not no lame)
She let me bang (Hit it from the back)
She let me bang (Hit it from the back), she let me bang (Let me bang)

Let me bang
Hit it from the back, hit it from the back
Let me bang
Let me bang
