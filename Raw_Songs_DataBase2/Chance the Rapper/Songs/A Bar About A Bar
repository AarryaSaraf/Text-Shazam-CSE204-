That's ten minutes
What you got?
Alright

I got a bar about a bar
It's not a joke, it's just a bar
A nigga walked into a bar
Took a seat, he like "This liquor hard, this woman easy"
Legend has it, he was callous, like fingers that pick guitars
He was just a, hit the park, his pickup truck, 'cause it was dark
To take a piss, the road was long, the line was long and shit
He thought about it, held it in and sipped his straw
Ashed out his cigar and walked out into his car
Forget that nigga, there was a line inside the bar
And the line was so long it wrapped behind the bar
And it, exposed moonshine and wine inside the jar
And it kept goin' to the alley and the trash behind the bar
To the same nigga, he was takin' a piss behind his car
The nigga in the front seen that this shit was out of order
The nigga in the back seen that the meters out of quarters
The patrons and the little wished this line was way shorter
I would tell you their names, but they names is unimportant

Is what I got so far
