Got 'bout three hoes on my sleigh (Up on my sleigh)

Just tell me, which floor should I get off?
And I'll be right there to set it off
I'll be right there to deck the halls
Either your love or none at all
And your presence is a present for me
For Christmas or just because
It's either your love or none at all
Either your love or none at all


Christmas
Oh, I love Christmas
Being obligated to buy shit for people at a certain time of the year
I buy Christmas gifts, but just, just 'cause you're supposed to
Jesus
Auto-Tune that for me
Jesus
Consumerism
Jesus' birthday
I swear to God, if you leave my raw vocals like that
We not friends anymore
Auto-Tune my shit and put them
Put them Travis Scott effects on my shit
