Come on, we gon' do it (Yeah, they know)
Come on (Better know)
Come here, you know how we do it (Let 'em know)
Kick, kick, foot down (Uh)
Kick, kick, ay, don't look down (This one's, one's)
Take a step back, come back around (This one's for you)
Who taught you how to step? Go ahead, go ahead


Know this Christmas, baby
I can't let this song come between friends
If I'm part of your holiday plans
Let's roll down Lake Shore Drive
Oh, let's dance
On down Michigan Ave and hold my hand
Take a red line from 95th to the End
Let it snow, let it snow now (Yeah)
Don't skip the Uber, I'ma pick you up
Everywhere I'm going, anywhere wit' ya
I'ma get money 'til it brinks the truck
Will you be my honey in love, we get stuck
We've been through problems, we've been test enough
Drinks to the sky, we gettin' fucked up
'Tis ain't the season without the one you love

If I'm your Santa
Just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney, babe
Turn your fireplace off
Hold out your hand
Can I dedicate to this last dance?
When was the last time you got romanced?
Here's a present for you


Come on, we gon' do this
Come on, we got this
Come on, come on, do it
It goes kick, kick, foot down
Kick, kick, don't look down
Take a step back, turn around
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?
Kick, kick, foot down
Same damn thing, don't look down
Take a little break, come back 'round
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?


If I'm your Santa
Just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney, babe
Turn your fireplace off
(Keep it all for Santa, baby)

The weather done got me in the spirit
The kids will be up any minute
We gon' put the presents under the tree (We gon' do that)
But 'til then, girl, you're all to me
And I can't (Can't wait for it)
I can't (Can't wait for it)
I can't (Can't wait for it)
I can't (Can't wait for it)


Come on, here we go, here we go
I said kick, kick, foot down (I can't, can't wait for it)
Do the same thing, don't look down (I can't, can't wait for it)
Take a step back, look around
Who taught you how to step? (Can't wait for it)
Who taught you how to step? (No, I can't, can't wait for it)
Kick, kick, ugh, ugh
Do the same thing, I ain't gotta look down (Can't, can't wait for it)
Nigga, slide back, look around (I can't, can't wait for it)
Who taught you how to step? (Can't wait for it)
I taught you how to step
