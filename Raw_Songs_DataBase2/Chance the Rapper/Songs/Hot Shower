Yup, yup, yerp
And then the smoke got me
Hey


I got muscles like Superman's trainer (Ooh)
Real real rare like Super Saiyan manga
I jump stomp-stomp on Lucifer, Satan
Now I got a few rings on, Jupiter skating
I meant to say Saturn, switched up the pattern
Smoking on some shatter (Ooh), got me higher than a ladder (Ooh)
Thanks I'm flattered, my baby mama badder
You look like Mick Jagger, oops, the grease splattered
Ooh, ooh, hot, hot (Ooh)
Jumping out the grease
It's a whole lotta degrees
'Bout to come up out the fleece, fleece, fleece
Shh, I don't wanna hear a peep (Skrr)
Tryna catch some sleep, tryna count some sheep

Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

Dude, I just called the plug and his phone was unplugged
I was lookin' at Doug like "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Dude, that shit don't even make no fucking sense
Like having fuckin' arguments for payin' 50 extra cents for barbecue
Saucing on the workers at McDonald's
I don't wanna sit and argue, Good Burger shoulda taught you
We all dudes
And I'm all professional and proper
But my baby mama stopped me in a meeting (Skrrt, skrrt)
Just to Airdrop me some nudes

Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour


Yeah, hopped off the flight, Louis V, Off-White (Ooh)

Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour


Got damn, think I got a new lawsuit, I need to come see you (What's that?)
I got a new whip, you know what a car do, turn a bitch to a eater (Mmm, mmm)
She said we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two seater (Okay, question)
Am I still considered a jerk if I get her a hoopty and buy me a Beamer? (Uh-uh)
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out, my lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence when they critique my demeanor (Ha)
Today I just signed to Republic (What else?)
And go get some head from a white man's daughter
Here lips ain't big but I'm loving it
I get in, fake ID, I'm McLovin' it
Beat the BNT like the government (What?)
Except for the cops, mission impossible
Strapped with the Glock, Danny Gloverin'
Tip a hunnid if you let my cousin in
You know everybody my cousin (Cause)
Oh yeah and I gotta be thuggin' it
'Cause my hair can get nappy as fuck
And wear jewelry and I got that chocolate coloring

Well at least, like you know, that's what they make me feel like
Why they make you feel like that
I don't know, I mean it's America right?


Ooh, hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour
