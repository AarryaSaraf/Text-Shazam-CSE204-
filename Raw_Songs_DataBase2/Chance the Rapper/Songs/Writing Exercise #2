The fable unfolds, the prin-
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh

The fable unfolds, the prince is coronated at home
Foreign states sent robes ornated in gold
The poor fated sore losers all hated their roles
They played it perfectly, I couldn't make it alone
My city, my throne, my chair is the bean, my lair my home
And fair is the queen, it ain't fair, I inherited liens
But my house stands straight, I'm the sturdiest beam
Heavy the crown but steady the vision
Eyes wide open, ears stay ready to listen
The petty decisions I left at the city's discretion
Skyscrapers are the throne on which I stand
I'm the African man, I stand on sovereign land
The spaceship is quite heavy so it rock when it land
A rocket ship is just a boat that takes off at a slant
I need a co-signer for a ocean liner again
Got a crew and a plan we can go dock at the sand
Look for a sign, I'm in between the line and the tan
At the closest point again, we'll be back here again
At the closest point again, we'll be back here again
