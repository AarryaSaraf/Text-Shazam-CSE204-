Mm
Mm (Yeah)


Snow's in the air, tree everywhere
Wind from the lake, something in the air
Christmas is here, bring your lady, cheer
Zero below, you're only in the 'Go
Pretty ring, I know, when she hit the phone
What? Just what she on
Salt on the streets, Timbs on my feet
Best time to give, Chi-Town it is
Fam all around, tryna run the town
Love how it smells, pray is all we do
Bucket full of wings
Tryna get 'bout five golden rings
Bottle for the cheers (Hey)
Drinks on, get your smoke on
Winter break, no school zone
Footwork, yeah, get your step on on
Yeah, yeah

What a merry Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest


Jeremih on the beat, lighting up a tree
Seven nominee, I cannot believe
Pray for '79th, pray for '79th
Ford City all the way to over East
I've been going in, snow inside my Timbs
Frozen all my limbs, big salt truck
Now I'm flying in, where you wanna land?
Million pair again, big boss bucks, baby
Finna hit the plaza
Cop a couple plasmas
You don't want no asthma
Mild sauce, my wings
Nights at the rink
These are a few of my favorite things


What a merry Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas (Chi-Town)
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas (Christmas)
This is Chi-Town, this is Chi-Town Christmas (Chi-Town)
This is how we do it in the Midwest (Christmas)
