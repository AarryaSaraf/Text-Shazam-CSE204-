Slippin' through tunnels in the sand
I hold your heartbeat in my hand
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

I lose my grip and start to drown
Still see your feet from underground
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

It feels like I'm in a glass box
Invisible cape is on top
Keep on confessing your love for
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep starin' at me straight through
Only not to be two hearts goin' blind
One, two, three, so I kissed goodbye and left the room

Don't break my heart

This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are

I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa

Go fuck yourself!
