Feel the rhythm

Fourteen's all about being free
And that's what I told people
What I am is free
Even though I'm in love

So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll take that bicycle with you
And I'll wheel it through the town

'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (you ready)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (listen close)
'Cause I love you
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)

You can drop me down, pick me up again
If you promise you'll catch me any day
You can listen to my songs anyway
'Cause I know you won't laugh (ha!)

You can wear matching clothes and
Dance along to the radio whilst
We walk back to your house along the main road
And you can drag me 'round Statesmans in my golden pump shoes

'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go
Shooby do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this
'Cause I love you
'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (yeah)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (yeah)
'Cause I love you (yeah)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)

Back to fourteen
All about bein' free
Tried to make myself not write this
But it had to be done
Tried to make myself not write it, but it had to be done
