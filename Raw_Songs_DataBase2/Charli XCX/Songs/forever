Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head (In my head...)

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

Head, in my head

You take your time, I'll take mine, we'll be fine
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
When the roof caved in and the water fell through
Hope when we're old, we'll be friends, reminisce
Hope we'll be there, be there, be there, us two
All the memories, all the photos we took

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head

I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever
I know in the future (Future)
We won't see each other (We won't see each other)
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever (Ever)
Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Said I'll love you forever (I know-I know)
I know in the future (Love you)
We won't see each other
Cold just like December
But I will always love you (Love you)
I'll love you forever
Yeah, I'll love you forever

I know-I know (Love you)
Oh, I love, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, love you
I'll love you forever
I know-I know (Love you)
Oh, I love, oh-oh-oh-oh
I know, love you
(I know-I know)
Future, we won't see each other
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you
I know-I know (Love you)
Love you

Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front, in the front of my mind
Front of my mind, never leave you behind
We say promises and we gave up the lies
Front of my mind, in the front of my mind
You stay right in front of my mind
