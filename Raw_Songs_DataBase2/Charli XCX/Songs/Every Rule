When I met you it was tragic
Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else in turn
And I was with somebody else as well
Met up late night by the Bowery
And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend

And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneaking around, falling deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breaking every rule for you
You're breaking every rule for me
I'm breaking every rule for you
But I've got to say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Straight away we started falling
Conversation never boring
When your lips brushed up against my skin
All I wanted was to let you in
I wonder if people would notice
Said you find it so hard to focus
Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

And we know that it's wrong
But it feels real fun
Sneaking around, falling deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's not fair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breaking every rule for you
You're breaking every rule for me
I'm breaking every rule for you
But I've got to say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
