Romance never seems to be roses
Never happy endings, unless someone pretendin'
But sometimes it feels good to be lonely
Call it independence, done with this pretendin'

I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

One hand in the air at the party
Stuck in sound and vision, something like religion, oh
Don't try to light something I've started
Yeah, you might be different, but I told you that we're finished, oh

I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

Hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world
