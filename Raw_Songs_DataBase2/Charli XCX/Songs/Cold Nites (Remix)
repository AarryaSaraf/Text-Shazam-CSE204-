Cold nites and harder days
Better lie down and lay away
Have a heart facing foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Hey, yeah, oh
Hope you know I miss you
Know that I want to kiss you
You said that I was the bestest bitch that ever stuck with you
After all the shit we've been through
How come you cannot see through?
We're stuck on automatic
Never there when I really need you

This shit for real, this shit is danger
You come around my house
And you act like a motherfucking total stranger

Anytime that I see you, baby
Anytime that I see you, lately
Hoping I'm safe for a while
Safe for a while

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Now what would I change to get you back to my arms again?
Instead that my life made you in love with a different man
If in my time you would pass my life
Could I still take you as my love
Tell me what I wanna do, tell what I gotta do better

Hey, yeah, oh
Hey
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

I can't see from how hard I'll be in where I'll stay
I pray for myself again
