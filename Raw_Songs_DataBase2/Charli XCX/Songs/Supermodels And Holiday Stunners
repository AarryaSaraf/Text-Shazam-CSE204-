Now if I had to be honest with ya
I thought you did fancy me just a little bit
It was like one of 'em twisted love tales
The endings didn't quite fit but

You were different
A rock and roll troll with your hair greased up, all in leather
And I was a pretty girl, polka-dots, hair in curls
Close friends all quite clever

It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that maybe
I was wrong and you liked the girl you met on holiday
More than you liked me

But then I thought
'Hey, what does she have to offer that I don't?'
Three Rolls-Royces and a cruise boat
But you picked the tramp over the queen

And you know
I actually liked you
You made me laugh lots
Made me giggle when I sipped my drink
Made me put more effort into my lyrics

It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that you were still obsessed by
The model stunners like Lily Cole and that Brazilian chick
Whoa, oh, oh

What do you say when you think it's time to walk away
Turn around, wave goodbye?
Or come and politely kiss me on the cheek, by my side?
Now that it's over, will you take my picture off your wall
Fill it with the holiday girl and Lily Cole
Or will you just leave me there to hang un-peacefully?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
