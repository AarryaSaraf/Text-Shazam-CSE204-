I already know I'm letting go of something sacred
Drive us off the road, I take a good thing and I break it
Think it's it my soul, the way I run from something real, no, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life
Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down my by side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you

Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah, I think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life
Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down my by side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away

It's something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away (Push you away)

It's something 'bout the way you, the way you
Way you move me
Way you move me
Yeah, yeah
Move me
