I can't believe you actually said to me
"I'm the one who made you"
Who do you really think you are?

You know you're making this more complicated than before
You know you're making me hate you more than I've ever done before
'Cause there's no way that you're allowed to say
That you built me up 'cause I was already made this way

Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your facts?)

We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual (ha)
But we know that's what it's about, yeah

So, what you gonna do when I leave you
You'll have no one who wants to play along with your silly little rules
'Cause you look up to someone much older
And bolder who barely knows you
They only want to talk to you so they can steal
Your cardigans and your Air Force Ones

Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your fact)

We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual

You got your glowsticks and all of your, you know
Your flashy little things
You've got your Spider-Man stickers, your brown hair, your polka-dots
But just leave it out
Leave it out
I told you, we're both the same
Both as catty as each other

Do you remember when we went to see that band
We couldn't stand and dance around 'cause you got us seated tickets
And oh, remember when we used to hold hands
Skip along and try to get our Converse dirty like
I remember when you used to call my name
And we'd play them cheatin' games behind people's backs
But we lost that in the neon competition
That's what it was really about, oh
(Game over)
