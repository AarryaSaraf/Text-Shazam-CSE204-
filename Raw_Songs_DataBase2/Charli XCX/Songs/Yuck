Not supposed to feel this way
I'm such a hypocrite
I always frown on love
It's giving me a tummy ache (All these butterflies make me sick)
Make me fly away (It's some Hocus Pocus shit, I'm bewitched)
For what?

Calling too much, you're breaking my phone
Mad when you do and sad when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you taking my coat
Too cute, no, this ain't me now
Candlelight, out on a starry night
You brush my hair to the side
And you tell me I'm pretty

Yuck
Now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck
That boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck
Lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck
Quit acting like a puppy
Fuck
Going all lovey-dovey on me

You got your hopes high
Thinking 'bout it most nights
Put me on a pedestal
'Cause my loves incredible
Don't wait up for me
I can't make those plans
Catch me if you can
Just flew into Japan
Come catch me (But don't you catch feels, that's so)

Yuck
Now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood start rushing
Yuck
That boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck
Lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck
Quit acting like a puppy
Fuck
Going all lovey-dovey on me

All, lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
(Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
All lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
All lovey-dovey on
(Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on me
(Why you do that? Why you do that? Why you do that?)

Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that? Mmm
Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that? (Mmm)
Yuck
(Why you do that to me?)
Yuck
