I like, I like, I like, I like
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
I like, I like, I like

Like your mind, like your smile
Like your eyes, I could die
Aeroplane, you are so fly
Singin' songs by Jeremih
Party time, hop inside (Woo)
We're so high, roller coaster ride
Diamond bright, kiss me right, yeah
That's so nice (Yeah)

I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you

So, don't you hold me back
'Cause I know when I know, I don't wanna be alone
Don't you hold me back
'Cause I know when I know, I wanna go

I'm not shy, make you sigh
Slip and slide up my thighs (Ah)
Juicy just like clementines
Sorry if I make you cry
Party time, hop inside
We're so high, roller coaster ride
Gemini, switchin' sides
Yeah, that's so nice (Woo)

I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like everything about you

So, don't you hold me back
'Cause I know when I know, I don't wanna be alone
Don't you hold me back
'Cause I know when I know, I wanna go

I, I, I, I, I like everything about you
I, I, I, I, I, everything about you
Everything about you
Every (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you, yeah
Everything about you
Everything
