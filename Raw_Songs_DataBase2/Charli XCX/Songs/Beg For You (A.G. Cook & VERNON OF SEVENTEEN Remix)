Eh, eh, eh, X-C-X

You know I go insane
Every time you have to catch a flight (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you oh
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed (Mm)

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you 'cause I'll beg for you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah

I don't think I'll ever feel this type of way again (This way again; Yeah, uh, yeah)
I beg for you, please (Don't let go), don't let go of me, don't let go of me
All the endless conversations about us been going on in our head
In the night, we dream a future together and I feel bad in your bed
I beg for you, please stay, I can't go a day without
No, I can't go a day without you, hoo

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you 'cause I'll beg for you
My heart is achin', my breath you've taken
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

Don't leave me, don't leave me

You're like an ocean breeze
Comin' and goin' just as you please (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Separated by a degree, hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach

Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you, oh-oh
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessin' now

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
My heart is achin', my breath you've taken
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

Don't leave me, don't leave me this
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way (Yeah), this way (Yeah)
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me (Yeah), don't leave me this way (Uh, yeah)
Way, way (Yeah), way, way (Yeah), way, way (Yeah)
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me

Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me (Yeah), don't leave me this way (Uh, yeah)
Way, way (Yeah), way, way (Yeah), way, way (Yeah)

This way, way, way, way, way, way
Don't leave me, way, way, way, way, way, way
It's Charli, it's Charli baby
Yeah
