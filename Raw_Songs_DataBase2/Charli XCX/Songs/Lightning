Don't know what to say
One look and then you blew me away
I'm spiralling all over the place
So lifted, got me reaching for grace
Body off the ground

Caught me by surprise
Like seeing shooting stars in the sky
There's danger in the dark of your eyes
But something 'bout you breathes me to life
Got me here and now

Heartbreak already hit me once
They say that it won't happen twice

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning

Electrified with love on the line
So different every touch, every time
Connected by invisible wires
Don't you cut me out

Heartbreak already hit me once
So swear that it won't happen twice

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning

Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Lighting, lighting
Give it to ya, give it to ya
(Walk away, I'll follow my soul)
Blinded, blinded
Yeah, tell me what you want, tell me what you want

L-L-L-L-L-L-Lighting, l-l-l-l-l-l-lightning
Lightning
You're love- lightning

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
