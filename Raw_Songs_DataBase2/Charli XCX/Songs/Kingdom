It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me blank
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm lost but I can't slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud
I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

To every rose with bloody thorn
It lifts you up and lets you fall
To rivers flowing yond the factory halls
Your kingdom's come, it's waiting still
The space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

I dance around, and I lost you now
I breathed you out, I kept you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around
