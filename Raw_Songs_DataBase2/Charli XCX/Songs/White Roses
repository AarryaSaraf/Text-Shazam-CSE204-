(Maybe my)
Eh-eh-XCX
(Maybe my, uhh)

Maybe my only light
Don't you recognise
You're the only one I want, uhh
Cold like ice, petrified, uhh
Loving what you're doing to me
(Doin' to me)

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and movin' slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

You'll be mine every night
I'm trying to advertise
You're the only one I want, uhh
Hold me tight, yeah, Marlboro Light, uhh
Loving what you're doing to me

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

We're gonna melt down
Gonna disappear into the sun, into the sun
Gonna burn down together like fire
We can't get enough
(No, no, no, no)
We're tied like white roses
You know we're never coming undone, coming undone
'Cause I wanna stay forever
I know that you're the only one, only one

White roses in the snow
Never let me go
Lying in your bed and moving slow
Taking off our clothes
Giving you it all
All I need is you and me alone
Love is like a rose
Baby, let it grow
No one knows the secrets that you know
Come on, pull me close
Lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it

(Ooh, aah, yeah)
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
Come on, pull me close, lay me in the snow
I know you can feel it
