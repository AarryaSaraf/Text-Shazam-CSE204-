I tell no lies

Jack Wills, clipped hair, penciled eyes, you get attention
Tight shirt, straight teeth, pinned up smile, all of them mention
How you look nice, tip-top, beautiful, the cat's pajamas
Suntan, golden brown, where you been? To the Bahamas?

Oh, but you can't see it, babe
Oh, you just see through it all
Oh, the girls turn green when they see you
Cause all of the boys start to call

They want your eyes
!Franchesckaar!

You've got your blue eyes, pink lips, Ugg boots, and lots of passion
Acoustic, iPod, soft sounds, music fashion
Sloan style, neck scarves, clingy friends all around you
You're the icon, shine out, watch what you do

Oh, but you can't feel it, babe
The effect you have on all of them
Oh, everyone stops and stares
And then the boys begin to call

// Lucy //

You see, the thing about her
She's just a bit too young, I think, personally
I don't really think she's ready for this kind of commitment yet
But whatever, you know what I mean?
It's your life, isn't it?
Bitch

When you first walked in the room, I had this feeling
You were gonna build me up then slowly tear me down
But then I looked behind the framework
And all of the glitz and gleams in your eyes (yeah, yeah)

'Cause you're just a bad bad girl with no brains inside your head (no)
Keep givin' it all this talk and let you know it
But you don't know shit
'Cause people cringe when you tell 'em a crazy fact (ha ha)
The way the words pour out don't make you sound all that

'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (no, they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (ha ha ha)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah)

The way you were slagging me off before you even met me
With your preppy ex-boyfriend, that just weren't too wise
The way I caught you whisperin' and lookin' me up and down
Subtlety is clearly not your game

You're a mixed up girl with no real friends in life
You get mouthy in a second but pipe down, it don't work on me
'Cause people laugh when you get mad (ha ha)
Tellin' people how to run their lives is really quite sad (yeah)

'Cause Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, nope)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, no)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (oh, yeah)
Yeah Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah)

I'll do what I want
Get out of my way
Don't just stand there, say what you want to say (move)
Get out of my face (move)
'Cause you got it wrong (ugh)
Just move along now on your own (get out of here)
Don't get on my nerves (yeah)
I've got my contacts (get out of my way)
Don't try and control me 'cause you'll get knocked back
Back into your place, right where you belong
Lucy, take a good listen to this song (yeah)

Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't, no one wants you, just go)
Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here
(She doesn't want you, I don't want you, just go)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (just leave me alone, go away)
Lucy, no one wants you here (no they don't want you)
Lucy, no one wants you here
Yeah, Lucy, no one wants you here (yeah, ha ha ha)

// Chas's Song //

It was twenty-five past nine at night
And I was really bored
So I sat down with my guitar
But I needed some new chords
I spoke to my good friend, called Chas
He was an indie boy
With skinny jeans, and vintage shoes
And hair all over the shop

And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to

I said it sounds okay
He said "Of course it does, you're a magician on guitar"
I said, "thank you love, I'm not that great
And I wouldn't go that far"
I've got this friend called Paul and his brain ain't small
He played the violin
But now he's a rocker, a leather jacket shocker
I wish I could play like him

He said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
When a raver boy asks for a dance"
For a dance, for a dance

And he said
"Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody
That you can sing along to, an indie tune
That will make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to"

// Leave Me //

Now is the time
We've both crossed the line
It's been way too long
And now we both see
How we can really be

And I see your face
And it reflects mine
Except mine isn't stained
With teardrops and lines
'Cause like you
Our friendship has withered

Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
So get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside

Well I'll call you again to see if we're friends
But I think we both know that our friendship
Cannot continue
Well I'll say that I'm fine and just wait for the time
'Til I know that I can live up to your expectations

Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
Get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside, yeah, yeah

I didn't love you, but oh, when I'm not with you
I can't help but want you, you so bad
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Quick, go away for a long time
Before I change my mind
If you stay, I'll only want more of you
So get out of my face
Get off of my doorstep and leave me, yeah
To cry on the inside

// I'll Teach You A Lesson //

Wake up one morning and your hair's all over the shop
What happened last night?
Well, the only person who knows is the person lying next to you
Get out of the bed, and you scream at your reflection
Same old, same old, it's just a typical day, it's going ahead again

But oh, boy, why don't you get some variation
Oh, boy, just have a retaliation
Oh, boy, just get some motivation
'Cause your friends are all out getting drunk
Whilst you're sitting at home having no fun

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride

Backcomb your hair
Tie up your shoes
We're gonna go to town
Come on, take the camera, you got nothing to lose

Scream and shout, all your friends do it too
Come on, what you waiting for?
I told you before, you got nothing to lose

Oh, boy, you're seeming so much better
Since I posted you on your red letter day
Oh, boy, you know all the girls are jealous of you
And they're polishing their pumps with the ra-ra skirts and the polka-dots
Just to try to impress you

Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride

Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me
Oh now, you're getting too good for me

Stealing all my limelight and my backstage passes
But then you say

'Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Why don't we go for a ride?
Come on, come on
Let's go for a ride
Oh

// Machines //

I sit up in my room at night
Hold on to my pillow tight
My dreams are being invaded by somethin' I don't know

I hear these words in my mind
I don't know who put them there but they sure ain't mine
Who's inside everyone's brain?
'Cause recently everybody's been actin' all the same
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

How did they get inside my head?
Makin' me feel so cold and dead
Your thoughts being captured as well
I'm locked in a trance, I'm under the spell
I feel their hands movin' over me
They're squeezing me tight
They're never gonna let me breathe (Breathe)
They take my heart and they rip it up
Change it for a broke watch and now my time is running out
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I can feel the tick tock when I turn my head
I can feel the tick tock when I lie in bed
I can feel the tick tock dancin' in my brain
And I can feel the tick tock runnin' through my veins
But when the tick tock stops yeah, my body erupts
When I close my eyes, I get electric shock
I feel the [?] in my skin, they're gonna win

I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine
I am
I, I
I am, I am a machine

You're one of me, I'm one of them
Say "Goodbye" to the world, we're never gonna be the same again
But now I know

Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who writes the songs? The machines do
Who rights the wrongs? The machines do
Who plants the bombs? The machines do
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

// Supermodels And Holiday Stunners //

Now if I had to be honest with ya
I thought you did fancy me just a little bit
It was like one of 'em twisted love tales
The endings didn't quite fit but

You were different
A rock and roll troll with your hair greased up, all in leather
And I was a pretty girl, polka-dots, hair in curls
Close friends all quite clever

It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that maybe
I was wrong and you liked the girl you met on holiday
More than you liked me

But then I thought
'Hey, what does she have to offer that I don't?'
Three Rolls-Royces and a cruise boat
But you picked the tramp over the queen

And you know
I actually liked you
You made me laugh lots
Made me giggle when I sipped my drink
Made me put more effort into my lyrics

It didn't really happen to start with
I have to say, I thought that you were still obsessed by
The model stunners like Lily Cole and that Brazilian chick
Whoa, oh, oh

What do you say when you think it's time to walk away
Turn around, wave goodbye?
Or come and politely kiss me on the cheek, by my side?
Now that it's over, will you take my picture off your wall
Fill it with the holiday girl and Lily Cole
Or will you just leave me there to hang un-peacefully?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

// Watch The Rain //

Let it pour, let it fall down like your dreams
Let it go, let it flow away into the gutter
Let it wash all the colour away from yourself
Let it take away the pain

I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it then but I just didn't want to say
And now when you look out your window it will never be the same
'Cause when it pours down from now on you'll always think of my name, yeah
I'll be in your brain

And if you get a leak in your roof
Just think of it like my problems pouring through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling
Think of how I'll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, yeah, falling from the autumn trees yet again
(And again and again and again)
And again, oh oh

Watch it drop from the sky like a child running away
Watch it roll off the page like a tear from my face
Hear the pitter patter on the pavement like me knocking on your door
As it brushes the floor

I remember when you asked me do I ever watch the rain
And I remember I was watching it then but I just didn't want to say
And now when you look out your window it will never be the same
'Cause when it pours down from now on you'll always think of my name, yeah
I'll be in your brain

And if you get a leak in your roof
Just think of it like my problems pouring through
And if you get a hole in your ceiling
Think of how I'll be feeling, cold and all alone
Like a drifting leaf, yeah, falling from the autumn trees yet again
(And again and again and again)
And again, oh oh

And I know you're working me out slowly but surely, slowly but surely
And I know you'll never tell about my other side
And that's why we all watch the rain, to wash away the secrets and the lies
'Cause I know everyone watches the rain sometimes

Watch it fall down as you watched me fall for you
'Cause you knew it was about you but you didn't have the guts to say
That you knew it was all for you

// Live Life //

What's been goin' on this week
Well, people started dealin' speed
And kids my age start smokin' weed
Just so that they can get some sleep

'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy spliffs and pick fights with the chavs

But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

Take a look inside the bag
It's enough to make you want to gag
'Cause you find out your daughter's a filthy slag
Some naked pictures and a box of soggy fags

'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

What's been goin' on today
Well, Susie didn't have her say
So she got her things and ran away
Never showed her face again
And Johnny failed every exam
Screwed up his parents' whole life plan
They got no job, can't be no man
He's a lazy ass, not a helpin' hand

'Cause parents, they get really mad
When their children start to turn all bad
And start hanging out with the wrong group of lads
Who smoke dodgy spliffs and pick fights with the chavs

'Cause parents, they get really mean
And they start to get all threatening
Saying they'll pack you out onto the street
If you come in late, smelling of green

But they forget
You can't rewind, no
You can't turn back time
'Cause there's always gonna be a better grassy side
But no one's gonna get there
So, just let them live their lives

Go on, let them live it
They're gonna just live their lives
Let her take another drag 'cause
They're gonna just live their lives

// Neon Fashion And Glowstix //

I can't believe you actually said to me
"I'm the one who made you"
Who do you really think you are?

You know you're making this more complicated than before
You know you're making me hate you more than I've ever done before
'Cause there's no way that you're allowed to say
That you built me up 'cause I was already made this way

Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your facts?)

We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual (ha)
But we know that's what it's about, yeah

So, what you gonna do when I leave you
You'll have no one who wants to play along with your silly little rules
'Cause you look up to someone much older
And bolder who barely knows you
They only want to talk to you so they can steal
Your cardigans and your Air Force Ones

Oh, look what you've done now
Just back down, yeah, back down (yes, back down)
'Cause I don't want you and your skinny jeans hanging around (just get out)
I was made to apologize but I didn't mean it (of course I didn't)
'Cause that T-shirt that you got me
I don't want it, you can keep it (is that your fact)

We messed it up, yeah (we got mashed up)
Both too proud to back down from the battle (from the battle)
Now we've got our neons on and our glowsticks out, trying to fight it out
To see who's more individual

You got your glowsticks and all of your, you know
Your flashy little things
You've got your Spider-Man stickers, your brown hair, your polka-dots
But just leave it out
Leave it out
I told you, we're both the same
Both as catty as each other

Do you remember when we went to see that band
We couldn't stand and dance around 'cause you got us seated tickets
And oh, remember when we used to hold hands
Skip along and try to get our Converse dirty like
I remember when you used to call my name
And we'd play them cheatin' games behind people's backs
But we lost that in the neon competition
That's what it was really about, oh
(Game over)

// Mauritius //

It was quarter to ten at night
And she was feelin' alright
Just been out shoppin' all day
'Cause it was the school holidays

And she got back home, sat alone
Flicked on the computer and talked to her friends
And this boy came online
He said he'd missed her
He said he liked her
Even though they weren't best friends
And had been for such a long time

So she started to ask some questions, oh oh oh
Just some random little things, yeah, yeah
'Cause she felt that if they were going to click
She'd need to know the details

He said "My favorite color's light blue, I like Irish ice cream
Whiskey's pretty yummy and I like worn-in jeans
I prefer kissing over hugging and laughin' over tears
I like pizza and Mauritius but I ain't been there in years"

Well, what a lovely, lovely boy
He seemed bright enough
He had a life and a good personality
But not much going on in the bedroom, if you know what I mean
But I guess it kinda adds to his appeal

This is the guy who said he liked her
And that she reminded him of something
He could see but couldn't quite reach

So she wrote all this down in a book
That she could look at any day
And it would always remind her of his smile
And his funny colored hair

She said "I like lots of different colors and cookie dough ice cream
Baileys is the best even though it's quite fattenin'
I prefer kissing over hugging and lovin' over tears
I like pizza and I don't think I've been to Mauritius", yeah

Oh, yeah, yeah
Is it good there? Is it good there?
Does it have lots of sun?
Is it good there? Would it be really, really fun?

He said "I think it would be fun if we went there sometime"
He said "Let's go"
She said "Where?"
To Mauritius

// Alcoholic //

Oh, I never noticed it before
How beautiful your fire burns
And I'm not really into the whole love song thing
But I'll try it out just for you

This is my last chance
This is my last chance
And I ain't taking any risks this time, no, no

This is your last chance
This is your last chance
To prove, to prove you'll be fine on your own

Now that I've warned you
Oh, what you gonna do?
You put the broken bottle up against your lips and take a drink
Breathe in, breathe out
But we don't care anymore, no, no, no

This is your last chance
This is your last chance
And you ain't taking any risks this time, no, no, no

This is our last chance
This is our last chance
To show them, to show them we'll survive on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own, on our own
On our own

// Yet Again //

She listens to Yellowcard
Just to fit in with her friends
'Cause they all know all the words
So she sings along just to click with them and

She tries to straighten her naturally curly hair
But it don't work, oh no, it don't
It just looks like a pile of shite on top of her head

Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

She helps out all the drunks who don't really want to know
Just so she looks like some kind of Good Samaritan and
She gets her friends to break up her enemies' girlfriends and boyfriends
And that kind of thing that they've got going on

Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

(1, 2, 3, ow)
Well, she used to have a lot of love
But I reckon she fucked it up and
I reckon she was one of 'em over-possessive types of girl
Comes up to her man, calls out 'Sam' and she turns all catty, hisses and scratches them away

Oh, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious (yeah)

Well, yes, yes, yes I'm banging on about her again (and again and again and again)
'Cause I can't get those things she's been sayin' off my brain
And this time I ain't mentionin' no names (no names, no names, no names)
'Cause that would make it too damn obvious

// 14 //

Feel the rhythm

Fourteen's all about being free
And that's what I told people
What I am is free
Even though I'm in love

So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll play in the woods with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll run through the river with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll climb that tree with you
So I'll take that bicycle with you
And I'll wheel it through the town

'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (you ready)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (listen close)
'Cause I love you
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)

You can drop me down, pick me up again
If you promise you'll catch me any day
You can listen to my songs anyway
'Cause I know you won't laugh (ha!)

You can wear matching clothes and
Dance along to the radio whilst
We walk back to your house along the main road
And you can drag me 'round Statesmans in my golden pump shoes

'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go
Shooby do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this
'Cause I love you
'Cause that's the kinda thing that people do when they are in love
'Cause they've got their own little song playin' on repeat in their heart
Some people's go (yeah)
Shooby do do, oh wop bop do do
Mine goes something like this (yeah)
'Cause I love you (yeah)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)
(Love, love, love, love)

Back to fourteen
All about bein' free
Tried to make myself not write this
But it had to be done
Tried to make myself not write it, but it had to be done
