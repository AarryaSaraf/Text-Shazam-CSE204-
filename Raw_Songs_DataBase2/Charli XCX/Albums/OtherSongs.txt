// 1999 (Stripped) //

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, All That
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like (Oh)
Never under pressure (Oh)
Those days, it was so much better (Oh)
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee hee)
Never under pressure (Oh)
Those days it was so much better (Oh)
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night, yeah

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view, I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah, yeah

Yeah
Back to 1999
Back to '99, yeah
I know those days are over but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my eye-eye-eyes
And I'm right there, right there (Right there, right there)
And he's right there, right there (Right there)
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view, I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999

// 5 In The Morning //

I know your type, think you're one in a million
Your diamonds are fake, you ain't golden
But I only fuck with the ones who are rare enough
Real enough, down to keep goin'
It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm goin' all in, I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

Pull up and stunt with your clique (Clique)
Glacier all up on your wrist (Wrist)
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases
But you ain't got nothing on this
I can see you talk, got a big mouth (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
Would you stick around for the comedown? (Come down, yeah!)
24/7, I'm 365
Wait for me heaven, I'm here 'til I die
Ah, ah

I'm goin' all in (All in)
It's 5 in the mornin', I'm busy ballin'
I ain't even stoppin' (No)

It's 5 in the mornin', I'm busy ballin'
I ain't even stoppin' (Yeah)
It's 5 in the mornin', yeah

I'm in my element every day
Birthday cake, you want a piece 'cause it's tasty
We on a roll, we don't stop 'til the bottles all popped
And the pills got me wasted
It's 5 in the mornin' and I'm goin' all in
I'm busy ballin'
Funny how wherever I wanna go
You wanna be there too

Pull up and stunt with your clique (Clique)
Glacier all up on your wrist (Wrist)
Think you're the sickest like you got diseases
But you ain't got nothing on this
I can see you talk, got a big mouth (Blah, blah, blah, blah)
Would you stick around for the comedown? (For the come down, yeah!)
24/7, I'm 365
Wait for me heaven, I'm here 'til I die
Ah, ah

// A Princess Song //

I could sit here all day
Bruising my skin and watching the waves
I could sit here all day in your sunshine eyes
I could stay here this way
Guiding your hand as we lie in the shade
I could stay here in your inner sea home

Let's run from the kingdom
Let's take all the treasure
Let's hide in this magic forever and ever

'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

You make me scream on the outside
Make me reveal all my colors to you
You make me want to untie all my soul strings
You make me live in the lie
Box up the truth, push it to the side
You make me smile as I sink deeper into your ocean

Let's dance with the dolphins
Let's lie in the flowers
Let's swing from this starlight for hours and hours

'Cause you set me free
You set me free
And I know that it's wrong, but it's innocent fun
And you set me free
You set me free
Just you, and all the other boys too

I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, just waiting for you, yeah
I'll stay in the field and I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting, waiting

// After The Afterparty //

After the afterparty we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
(XCX, Charli!)

I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup and I'ma keep on sippin' all night, yeah

The party just ended but I'm not done with you
But my folks are out of town, we got a crib with a view
Y'all come over, bring a couple friends, I keep mine with me
Shouts out to Whitney, she was so wicked
The party was so crazy, oh

Tomorrow I'll be lazy
But I'll spend it with you baby

// Art Bitch //

You are an art bitch
But I like it
Yeah, I like it
You use your camera as an eye
Taking photographs of everything you see
Making the pain look better
You wear glitter on your face, look like a mess
Back-combed hair all over the place
Out in the fields drinking JD and Coke from plastic bottles
And I admire your individuality
MySpace, PhotoShop
Interesting captions that captivate me every time

You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

You are an art bitch
With your plastic bees and your floral pattern dresses
You use your needle and a string to sew up your dreams
Of going to France or New York, or wherever it is
You're gonna get there one day
You hate big-brand fashion, think it's shit
Like charity better, it's much more purer and original
Like your handwriting, which is backwards
And I admire your individuality
Strange kinda dancing like a rock-n-roll Najinksy
Bossa nova be pop like, like 10 years ago

You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you in your photographs
They love you, they love you in your photographs

You are an art bitch at heart
But it's wonderful, so beautiful, so amazingly lovely
And I love the way you hate love
It's so refreshingly nice to see it in your eyes
That you mean exactly what you say

Yo, chainsaw tight like a wrapped up mic
I'm an ill motherfucker and I only drink snake bite
Get yourself right, lock you in the fucking coffin
Bury you alive and there ain't no way I'm fuckin' stoppin'

You're a sad bitch, but I'm a bad bitch
Got more cheese than your motherfuckin' sandwich
Speak another language, your boy will never understand me
Roll deep, with the guns and their fucking candy

Fuck you up quick with a hammer and a hacksaw
Uh, your bitches know I'm so gnarly
Beating up the track like, ow ow Charli

Yeah, yeah it's a underage wet dream
Uh, but that bitch so sexy

Yo, uh, you don't fuck with me

Lock you in a dungeon
Suck out your blood through a fuckin' straw
Put it in a cocktail and serve it to your mother
Uh, peace

Can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights (Ah, ah-ah-ah)

Put your lips on my lips

Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed

In the night, we dream a future together and I feel bad in your bed
I beg for you, please stay, I can't go a day without
No, I can't go a day without you, hoo

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?

Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

Don't leave me, don't leave me

You're like an ocean breeze
Comin' and goin' just as you please (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Separated by a degree, hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach

Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you, oh-oh
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessin' now

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
My heart is achin', my breath you've taken
Oh, babe, I just want a taste

// Boys //

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I can't even lie, you got me

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby

But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back

I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse
But I can't even lie you got me

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Darling, I can't stop it even if I wanted
Don't be mad, don't be mad at me (No, no, no, no)
Missed what you were sayin', I was miles away, yeah
Don't be mad, don't be mad
Not like I had a choice
I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys

I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys

// Chains //

You got a blue heart
You got magic hands
You blow me candy kisses
We've got secret plans
I'm in a black box
But I can see the light
I'm on the other side of this paradise

We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I got a lot of love, but I'm scared it's gonna go to waste
Locked inside an empty room
How can I get through to you?
Lying on the floor I'm just a body in an open grave
I just wanna scream your name
I am gonna rise again

We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh
I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh

We could run away
We could run away
Take me out this place
We could break the chains
We could run away
We could run away
Help me, please escape
We could break the chains

I just wanna kiss your face
I just wanna have a taste
I am gonna break the chains, chains, oh, oh, oh-oh

// CHARGER (Charli XCX Rework) //

God, that's so classic
I'm three precent away from bein' stranded
The way I left was way too cinematic
The realization hadn't even landed
God fuckin' dammit

Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad?

And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
(But) I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder

One thing linkin' me to you
Plugged in, waitin' in your room
I left just a piece of me there
Text sent, but you left me on read
I wish I could tell it straight
No games, lookin' at your face
I left a piece of my heart there
I wish I never cared, yeah

Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind, yeah
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad? No

And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
But that'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder

And if I'm gonna go back
Would you make it, make it harder?
'Cause I don't wanna go back
To the moment when I left and how it started
And I think this was a sign
But if you're fine, it don't feel right, yeah
'Cause it'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder

You make me feel like I could sparkle through the night
You are beautiful like lightning

You are like magic
You're my angel in the sky
You're my baby, never leave me
Catching all the tears I cry, oh
You're the glow in my heartbeat
You're the spark in the empty room
You're the song on the repeat
You're the star and you're in full bloom
And I hope that you know, I'ma always be right by your side
Crystals just don't satisfy

Hey, did you know that I'll always be in love with you?
I can't fake it, my heart's taken

Our love cuts like diamonds
Your love alone, worth finding
Give me your heart, give me what you're hiding

Your love, the fire within me
Give me your hand, we are shining
Our love cuts like diamonds

I feel your power
We could take over the world
You're the apple of my eye

Don't need no rubies, don't need emeralds or pearls
We are perfect just the way we are

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

Get tipsy, tricksy, Dixie
Burning colors in your brain
Emelline just ruled the world, and it won't be the same
Unknot your lips, embrace the trips
And tend after your tails
Or tie me to the kitchen chair if all else fails
Acoustic treats, sadistic beats
Get your shoes, move your feet
Emelline, you're running out of time to impress
Take off your dress and let them look at the scars
From when you met the stars in the backseat of your car

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)
Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

I know you lie, Emelline, with your lips
Standing like a dollar glass around your neck
Just cover it up
Put on your spectacles and be a good girl like mommy said
Don't let the pills affect your head
Keep your eyes wide and secretly smile
And everybody will try to connect with you and adapt to you
They'll want to dance with you
They'll have to crawl across the room just to get to you, wow!

Emelline (you are so fine)
Oh, Emelline (please, just be mine)
Oh, Emelline (yeah, we can shine)
Oh, Emelline (oh, Emelline)

Stuck in an avalanche

A thousand shooting stars
And many mysteries
And you know we got more to show
The planets are aligned
We got something divine
So open up the sky
You know this is our time
Oh, now you know

We gotta live right now
Jumping off the edge
Don't ever slow us down for nothing
We wanna live right now
Jumping off the edge
We're gonna live our lives for something more

// Heartbreak High //

Why can't you just let me sleep?
I don't know, I don't know
Locked inside this broken dream
I can't go, I can't go

Body turns into paper, ink stains on my hand
Writing turns to bruises, I can't stand

Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
We're dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

Ice blue lips upon my skin
So cold, so cold

Nothing with each other, our lights begin to flame
Sick down to my stomach, we can't change

We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

Ooh, never gonna take me there
Ooh, never gonna make it there

We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

We're living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high

Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna take me there)
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna make it there)

Living in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna take me there)
Dying in a heartbreak high, heartbreak high
(Ooh, never gonna make it there)

// I Don't Know Your Name //

So lost and so alone, can't take it no more
You watch me lose control dancing on the floor

Wanna feel the pound of a heartbeat?
Do you wanna feel a rush when I go insane?
I wanna be unwrapped like a candy cane
The only ones you love, no time for pain
Wanna be a bad little secret?
Do you wanna feel the blood running through your veins?
I wanna be the girl inside your brain
But only for a night wanna play the game

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Your touch electrifies my body and soul
You're such a sweet escape now I can't let go

I wanna lose myself in the passion
Do you wanna be my boy? Wanna run away?
I wanna stick with you on a kiss and chase
I can see me chilling at your place
Only one to be a distraction
Now the only thing I see seems to be your face
I wanna be the girl that keeps you safe
I only meant tonight, but it must be fate

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name

I, I will not just fall in love, fall in love right here
I, I can't fight this feeling, oh, feeling so lovesick
Oh, I really can't believe this, but it's so damn true
So much magic come between us
Now I'm all for you

I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name

// I'll Never Know //

I took a look into your ocean heart
And ever since, I stumble through the dark
I'm like a moth attracted to a flame
'Cause since we've met, you know, I'll never be the same
(Oohh-ohh)

Oh, I'm like a tiger but in black and blue
'Cause all my bruises wanna [?] for you
I wonder if you'll ever know my name
I wonder if we'll ever ever meet again

What if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!

I'm searching deserts and the morning skies
Just to stare into your diamond eyes
I'll build a rocket and I'll fly to space
Just so that I can touch your picture perfect face
Oh, your picture perfect face, oh

I wonder if you'll do the same for me
Or would you stay there and just let me be?
And all my blood will drip the color of gold
'Cause that's the love that runs for you within my soul

But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
But what if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
'Cause when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
When if I see you alone on the pavement?
Will my heart freeze? Will the sun melt down my bones?
And when I think of you my fingers are quicksand
I want to hold you close
I'll never know
1 2 3, oh!

// Interior //

Be sure you know what you are after
Open up every scar
I've been known to strike like disaster
They say I hit hard

Think anyone, anyone but you, anyone, anyone but—
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

When you fell in love
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my heart

Now I've got you where I want you
Never say you were not warned
I'll make you wish you were never born
The harder you fight, the harder you fall

Think anyone, anyone but you, anyone, anyone but—
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

When you fell in love
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my heart

Thought I was processed, thought I was packaged
Just like an apple pie wrapped in the plastic
Got love but you're never gonna have it
Fell so hard like Alice and the Rabbit
Locked down, can't move, now you don't know what to do
Took a bite of the apple, went straight to the core
Fell in love with my interior

Think anyone, anyone but you, anyone, anyone but—
Think anyone, anyone but you
Should have known what you were after

When you fell in love
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my— (fell in love)
The interior design of my heart

When you fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love

// Kingdom //

It's all black
Your kingdom's turned me blank
I'm paper and I'm snow
I'm lost but I can't slow
I'm lost but not alone
It's so light
The dark it burns my eyes
My bones, they used to glow
But now I'm throwing stones
I'm losing where to go

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

Without you, my lips are turning blue
The water pulls me down
And drowns under your sound
This silence booms so loud
I'm locked up
Your kingdom's like a drug
The chains are made of glass
I'm breaking through your blood
I'm never strong enough

Shadows on my back are moving slow
They twist behind like white leaves in the wind
And as I ride, these horses will take flight
Falling hard, falling high, through your arms
Shadows in my head don't need no light
They stay through the night

To every rose with bloody thorn
It lifts you up and lets you fall
To rivers flowing yond the factory halls
Your kingdom's come, it's waiting still
The space between you'll never fill
I tried but I could not change your mind

I dance around, and I lost you now
I breathed you out, I kept you out
But if I could, I'd turn back around

// Let U Down //

I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

White pills, empty hotel
Teardrop, standstill
Phone calls, kiss through windows
Whisper, "I'm true, burn through"
Your palms open up
White pills, white raindrops
Don't choke, I'm here standing still

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

White pills, empty hotel
Good girl, don't tell
I feel like I've been here before
No one to say they hate me, no one at all
She says she couldn't save me
Said she'll never call

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

I know, it's so easy to blame me, the blame I take it all
(The blame I take it all)
White pills, empty hotels
I'm not staying strong (I'm not staying strong)
Give it up for you (Give it up for you)
Give it up for me (Give it up for me)
I promise, I'll be fine, but tonight I'm taking three

'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

// Miss U //

I love you
It's obvious, but people can change
We got bruised
We left things undecided and now we're two people
We're standing in the city rain
But we're brand new
We turn our backs and walk away

Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some nights, I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

So far
I'm on the other side of the globe
With new friends
With someone else asleep in the sheets
But I got you, yeah
Locked up in a part of my brain
Forever, yeah
I can't forget my memories, no

Even though we're through
I'm always here for you
I know you feel it too
I'm telling you the truth

Some nights, I go back there
Right back where we used to love
Think I messed up somewhere
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know what I keep running from
Don't know why I keep running
Don't know why I keep running

Sometimes, I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on
And I, I miss you when I'm all alone
And even though we both moved on
Sometimes I play your favourite song
I play it on and on and on

Don't know what I keep running from
(All I know, all I know)
Don't know what I keep running from
(All I know, all I know)
Don't know why I keep running (I miss you)
Don't know what I keep running from
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know what I keep running from
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running
(I miss you, I miss you, I miss you)
Don't know why I keep running

// No Angel //

Always been a little bit fast and wild
My mama always said I was a problem child
I'm just livin' life until the day I die
It's all I know, that's how I roll

I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn

The second that you saw me, you were mesmerized
Bet you probably thought I was your ride or die
Don't wanna burst your bubble, but I cheat and lie
It's the truth, I'm bad news

I party, get naughty
Always tellin' myself, I'll never do this again
I'm sorry that you caught me
Fuckin' in the hotel, it didn't mean anything

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn

Ooh, feels so good, feels so good, feels so good
Maybe you're just too good for me
But you're in too deep, yeah
Ooh, I get stressed out, it's too much, the pressure is on
And I can't quite breathe
If I go there, pull me right back, yeah

Don't let me, don't let me go
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh
Baby, I'm bad to the bone
I just wanna let you know that I'm no angel
But I can learn, oh

Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
Promise I'll try, promise I'll try (oh)
I'm no angel, but I can learn

// NYC (The Way Out) //

All alone on a city high
In New York in the dead of night
We can't swim, we're about to drown
All alone in a famous town

We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

No oxygen left in our hearts
Goin' down and we felt the pain
But we're lookin' cool, sinkin' in the chain
We feel the same as we fall apart

Out here in the blue with the lights behind us
Shot us in our backs but we keep on ridin'
I don't wanna go and the lights are blinding

We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

We always knew we never would survive (Survive)
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)
We always knew we never would survive
Protect ourselves and hide out in denial
We on the way, on the way out (We, we, we, we)
We on the way, on the way out (On the way, way out)

All alone on a city high
In New York and the dead of night

// Ride //

You know I need the windows rolled down
Hundred miles, tires screech
Burnin' rubber, limousine off the chain
I go for 24 hour, neon pink, bring the heat
'Bout to swerve-a-swerve right through your lane

It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (Shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride (Shh)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna)

Foot on the gas
Squeezin' on it like juice
Pedal pusher, sippin' on lemonade
Kaleidoscope, traffic light
All I see is red and blues
Guess we got a couple friends on the way

It's like we're on the same wave
It's like we're on the same wave, now
We 'bout to go Miami
It's like we're on the same wave, no, no, no

I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride, drugs in the ride
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride
I wanna hop in the ride (Right now), drugs in the ride (Right now)
Drink in the ride, fucked up in the ride (I wanna, yeah)

// Simply Irresistible //

How can it be permissible?
She compromise my principle, yeah, yeah
That kind of love is mythical
She's anything but typical

She's a craze, you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

Her loving is so powerful
It's simply unavoidable
The trend is irreversible
The woman is invincible

She's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

Simply irresistible she's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went
Simply irresistible she's all mine, there's no other way to go

She's unavoidable, I'm backed against the wall
She gives me feelings like I never felt before
I'm breaking promises, she's breaking every law
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went
Simply irresistible, she's all mine
There's no other way to go

Her methods are inscrutable
The proof is irrefutable
She's so completely kissable
Our lives are indivisible

She's a natural law and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her

Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible
Simply irresistible

// Spoons //

Slippin' through tunnels in the sand
I hold your heartbeat in my hand
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

I lose my grip and start to drown
Still see your feet from underground
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again

It feels like I'm in a glass box
Invisible cape is on top
Keep on confessing your love for
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep starin' at me straight through
Only not to be two hearts goin' blind
One, two, three, so I kissed goodbye and left the room

Don't break my heart

This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are

I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
I think I'm about to fall
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa
Deeper and deeper, whoa

Go fuck yourself!

// SuperLove //

You're whiskey-wasted and beautiful dancing through the fire
You're such a vision to see
I used to think that the power of love was just a song
But now it's got hold of me

S.O.S, is it me, or is this is dangerous?
Kill me with your touch
You're smoking through my blood
R.I.P, set me free, yeah, this is dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

Feels like I'm tripping, I'm falling hard from the highest heights
When I crash, where will you be?
I think your hair looks much better pushed over to one side
How do you feel about me?

S.O.S, this is real, and this is dangerous
You're my favorite drug, I'll smoke you in the club
R.I.P., what a dream, you're so damn dangerous
I can't get enough

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
'Cause I never seem to get enough
So give me all of your super love
I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

When I fall into your super love
Yeah, my heart never wants it to stop, please save me
'Cause I never seem to get enough
You're the bullet and you're making me drop, please save me
So give me all of your super love
'Cause my body is a ghost for you, I'm waiting
Die here, in your arms, falling in love with you

// Valentine //

I had to sit there and listen to poetry all day
And I tried to escape but they won't let run away
So I tried to hide, but they wouldn't let me hide
So I tried to find you, but I couldn't find you anywhere

And I was sitting next to you in the biology lecture
And I pretended I didn't understand just to capture your attention
And then I smiled, and then you smiled
And then I smiled, and it was all worth my while, oh
All worth my while

But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
'Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

And I once told someone, they should write some golden poetry
'Cause it would get them far in the music industry
It'd do them good
And I guess that's what I'm doing now
I'm doing good, yeah
I knew I'd have to do it sometime

And I hope I get to see you on February the 14th
'Cause then I might be able to try this whole thing again some other time
Oh, you can be my Valentine
Oh, it's the time
Will you be my Valentine, -tine, Valentine?

But later on by the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
'Cause I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not

Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
'Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense if the knew how to save a life
But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right
Oh, I'm starting to worry that I'm sounding like The Fray
'Cause I hate the way they talk about sadness and life decay
But they must talk some sense if the knew how to save a life
But I never talk sense, no, I haven't done this right

Last year on the sofa, I wanted to kiss you, I wanted to kiss you
But I couldn't get that close, no, I couldn't get that close
And when you opened your eyes
It was like you didn't wanna see my face in your personal space
And I wanted to run away, yeah, I wanted to run away
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me, yeah
But obviously not, yeah
I was told that you liked me, I was told that you liked me
But obviously not, no

No, no, no, no
Obviously not, yeah, yeah, oh
Nah nah, yeah
Oh oh

// Wires //

You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
You got tears, making tracks
I got tears that are scared of the facts

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes

You got wires, going in
You got wires, coming out of your skin
There's dried blood on your wrist
Your dried blood on my fingertips

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know

I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
You'll be alright
Alright

Running down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
I see hope is here in a plastic box
I see Christmas lights reflecting in your eyes
Down corridors, through automatic doors
Got to get to you, got to see this through
First night of your life, curled up on your own
Looking at you now, you would never know
