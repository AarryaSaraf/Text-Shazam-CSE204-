Album: TrueRomance

// Cloud Aura //

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Uh, uh, Brooke Candy

We were on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
'Cause I knew it ain't easy livin' life in the trap
I was the Queen B and you were like my Jay Z
Only one who held me down when I was fuckin' crazy
Ivana and Trump, shit, we coulda ran the world
You were my Chris Brown, I was your only girl
Let you put your feet up while I was cookin' you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email 'cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pullin' up a private photo of a bitch showin' her thong
Then I look a lil' closer, it's my home girl Lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob, so I put a hit on it
Handed you my heart, then you took a shit on it
That's fucked up

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

Now I'ma fuck your shit up
Set fire to your pick-up
And drive it super sonic
Crash and burn it with my sister
No, I don't need a mister
Cancel the babysitter
I'm never going down that road
It's easy to resist ya

You broke my heart
And I'm never gon' forget this
You broke my heart
And now I'm comin' back to get ya, don't you know?

Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart
Baby, what hurts the most
Is when you become so cold
You're starting to hurt my heart
You left me here in the dark
Now I got to make a change
I don't want to see your face
I'm starting to hurt your heart
Hope you fall apart

// Nuclear Seasons //

Let my car run out
Cars burn out
I won't scream or shout
Lost my breath now
Let's die together, no one lives forever
(Cars burn out)
Let's die together, no one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
No one lives forever
Falling through the clouds
('Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing)
No one lives forever

When you go, please don't leave your love in the sun
My heart will melt away
In the night, with your twisted tongue
When you drop the bomb, I'm blown away

'Cause I refuse to hide in the page of your story
I come out the box, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

Now I'm facing this on my own
'Cause you taste the blast and it shook your bones
I'm a warrior all alone
In the field of lies, I won't go home

'Cause I didn't burn my skin in the blaze of glory
I come out your hands, I won't say I'm sorry

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons
We survived nuclear seasons

I can feel it, I can feel the fear
I can feel it, inside of my soul
Inside of the soul

We in the nuclear season
In the shelter I'll survive this though
We in the nuclear season
Summer lovin' in the backseat gone

We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)
We survived nuclear seasons
(Good times, dark nights)

// You (Ha Ha Ha) //

Yeah, we got a situation
Lock down, and I'm trapped in the basement
I'm a victim of replacement
'Cause you acting so leather
Trying to put across your statement, oh

'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha ha ha ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh
'Cause we used to be the cool kids
You were old school, I was on the new shit
We were addicted to the blue print
But we threw it in the flame
And now we're never gonna trace it, oh

'Cause I know you struggle
Choke when you see love grow

You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up

And now you're walking on your own
Rain falls down, I'm not answering my phone
I got to phase you out my zone
Hope you realize now that I am never coming home
You were meant to be alone

You, you lied
Ha-ha-ha-ha, I was right
All along, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
It's a front, good job
Good job, you fucked it up
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

// Take My Hand //

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Come on baby, put your hands on my hips
Then swing your lips to my lips
Wanna taste your heart; don't interfere
Into the night, we'll disappear

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
Yeah, take my hand
(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?

Can you feel the neon lights?
It's like the milky way
I swallowed something stupid, it's making me stay awake
And now I'm on the cloud, I'm talking extra loud
I keep on dancing, gonna lose my body in the crowd

Why you gotta go to sleep?
Don't go to sleep
Don't go to sleep
Let's go out
Get blown away
Lost in the dark
Get real high
And never come down

Just take my hand
Yeah, take my hand

(Let's dance)
Won't you please just take my hand?

(I'm in your hand)
(I'm in your hand)

// Stay Away //

You choke my throat with words of wonder
You make it hard to breathe
Your love's so cold, just like an arrow
Pierced through my skin, I bleed

I knew you were no angel
But God, what did I do?

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
On my hands, on my knees, pulled on the chains
Licking up the blood, yeah, I made this decision

You took my light
Trapped in the prison
You threw away the key
You are the curse, I am the captive
Walking on hands and knees

Never learn, never learn
Never learn, never learn

You were no angel
But God, you're just electric blue

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away, stay away

I climbed a wall to touch your shadow
I hear you call for me
But you're not there, you're just an echo
Why did you fall for me?

Do you remember what I said that first time we met?
Stay away, why couldn't you stay away?
I never needed anyone, but now that you are gone
Stay away, won't you just stay away?

Taking all my light and blocking out my vision
Bad little girl you have trapped in the prison
Won't you just stay away?

// Set Me Free //

I am just crushed in the velvet
My heart is locked in a box
I am still sinking in black skylines
But now I want it to stop

I'm sailing high but I can't see
I've been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I'm falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain

I have been dancing with shadows
I have been calling your name (calling your name)
I feel the skin dripping from my bones
Your touch, it makes me insane

I'm sailing high but I can't see
I've been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I'm falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

I can't do this no more
You're tearing me apart
So give me one last kiss
And then I have to let you know

You've gotta set me free
Yeah, you devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain

// Grins //

Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

(Let my car run out) Let my car run out
(I won't scream or shout) I won't scream or shout
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing with an angel
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Cars burn out, lost my breath now
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds

(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Hope we're on the same wavelength
Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
I can't quite hear what you're saying
Because my body started shaking
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That's my heart that you were breaking

Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again
Wish you could see me when I'm lying in bed
My eyes are blinded by your stars
My blood is blushing so red
(Oh my God)
I can see you in my head again
Arrows of roses shoot me dead again

(Let my car run out) Let my car run out
(I won't scream or shout) I won't scream or shout
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I'm in heaven, dancing with an angel
(Let my car run out, I won't scream or shout)
Cars burn out, lost my breath now
(Let's die together, no one lives forever)
'Cause I feel like I am falling through the clouds

Hope we're on the same wavelength
Hope you don't think that I'm crazy
Beaches and oceans for my baby
Hurry up, and come and save me
I can't quite hear what you're saying
Because my body started shaking
Beaches and oceans, earth is quaking
That's my heart that you were breaking

(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)
(No one lives forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever)

// So Far Away //

Gimme the poison
I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison

Get out my head, get out my bed
I don't believe those three words that you said
Pocket of lies, crystal blue eyes
Hit the ground hard when I dropped from the skies
You're coming up when I'm going down
Never in sync, so we just sank and drowned
Press restart and reboot my heart
But I'm not a robot, so I fell apart
Before the moment we met, we were chatting on the Internet
Getting kinda close through the posts that we were looking at
I was pretty confident, you were pretty into that
I linked you to my music just to see if you'd be into it
So fuck the prologue, read the Internet blogs
Gonna love this style and I came from the clubs
I wasn't looking for a thug, I was looking for a bad boy
Bad boy, motherfucker, destroy

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison
I want the poison, I need the poison
Gimme the poison, I love the poison
Hooked on the poison

(So far away
So long ago, and so far away
So far away
So long ago, and so far away)

Now I know for sure that we've got to end this
You don't get no last kiss
'Cause you're so damn crazy, and I'm so damn helpless
So don't text my number
And don't call my mother
I can't see your face now
'Cause this is over

I can't believe all those things that you said
You broke my heart and you fucked with my head, again
So I run... (so long ago, and so far away)
I can't believe all those things that you said
You are the poison, I drank the poison
(So long ago, and so far away)

// What I Like //

You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

Used to come around, you'd be knockin' on my front door
Playing board-games, horror films with the super gore
Thought that you were cute from the start
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
You were like the medicine, the medicine, I wanted more
All along, I wanted someone to vibe with
Found the guy I want the rest of my life with
Ha, we on some husband and wife shit
I don't really care, 'cause I know that I like it

And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart's been broken
We'll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
And when the clouds part open
When the last word is spoken
When the last heart's been broken
We'll be sitting on your bedroom floor still smoking
Smoking, smoking

You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

Oh, now I got a plan
I hope you gonna be my man
I can see us cushy in the house right by the ocean sand
And when I wanna cry, I hope you're gonna hold my hand
And when the shit goes down, I hope you're gonna make a stand
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangster
I think I'm into you
This shit is super wild
This shit is super cool
This shit is kinda gangster
I think I'm into you

You call me up at six
Come 'round, undressing in my house again
Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like
You call me up at six

Your T-shirt's on the floor
Yeah, we're undressing in my house again
You know just what I like

// Black Roses //

Purple and scarred
It's the color that will be on my heart, my heart, my heart
When you are done and dusting with me
I fall apart when I wash your touches off of my skin, my skin, my skin
I know you're tired of sticking to me

Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You've got a diamond desire
Gonna step into the blue fire
Touching your lips with my skin
I'm on another level
I can't let go
Sat in the garden of sin, like an angel with the dirty wings
Tainted by tastes of the soul, this is another level
I need to know

Why am I deep in black roses?
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses

You're turning me off
Out of phase and into focus you keep turning me on
You're turning me on, you're turning me off

Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, going down down down
Black roses, black roses

Deep in black roses
Dateless doses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses
I'm falling victim to black roses
Black roses, black roses, black roses

// You're The One //

Dancing
In the darkness
Pink and lilac
Keep the silence
Crystals
On the skyline
Cut the midnight
Ultraviolet

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Flying
Through the black night
You're the angel
In the moonlight
Running
Through the thunder
Undercover
Silver lover

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

You're the one who can make me stay
You're the only one who makes me feel this way
You're the one who's been stealing stars
Your golden arrow went through my heart
You're the one who can turn the page
You're the one who came along and unlocked the cage
Now I'm dancing in the dark

Yeah, I'm dancing in the darkness
Three years before, I was feeling so heartless
But your burn shined through
Now I'm drinking love potion when I lay next to you
It's a criminal feeling
Happiness cries and my tears are dreaming
My body is screaming
I'm staying right here, no, I'll never be leaving

// How Can I //

My hands are frozen into chains behind my back
So please, don't swallow down the key
Let me out now
Yeah, I'm in trouble
Can't stop what's coming
Can't blame this one on bad luck

How can I? How can I?

How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

Iced out, got hot, bit the dust hardcore
But I'm at the same place I was before
Yeah, I'm in trouble
Can't stop what's coming
Can't blame this one on bad love

How can I? How can I?

How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

It was boys and girls, and girls, and boys
The Southern Comfort from your comforter got destroyed
It was shady eyes with the violent noise
We on the graveyard digging where the love is void
We had a meltdown underground
Just a cemetery chick, but it's over now
But I still taste your bones when I'm all alone
You're the best I ever had, but now you've got to go
And now I'm on my own
I said, "Please don't go."
Please don't go

How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
I miss your touch and my skin on yours
I want a taste of what I adore
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I fix what I fucked up?
How can I? How can I?
How can I fix what I fucked up?

// Lock You Up //

It's a long way home, but I'm making my way
With so many things still left to say
I try to think about the one I need the most
When my mind goes black
And then it hits me like a ton of bricks
I want you, no, nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you
But sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart

Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There's no way of knowing that you'll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape in a world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith
I love you, not-nothing else
I want to lock you up inside my heart

I always wanted you
But sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up

We won't stay, we run
Love like melting sun
Please don't leave, don't run
Won't you stay in tonight?
Taste my lips, don't let go
I'm in your hand
I'm in your hand
I'm in your hand

I always wanted you
But sometimes it's hard
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up inside my heart
What do I do to lock up inside my heart?
I want to lock you up
I want to lock you up inside my heart
