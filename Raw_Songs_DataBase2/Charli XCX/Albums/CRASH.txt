Album: CRASH

// Crash //

I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary
I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary

(Uh)
Overloading when I'm looking in the mirror, uh (Uh)
Feel myself, I'm looking way better than ever, uh (Uh)
Overloading when I'm looking in the mirror
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash

I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary
I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary

I don't know if I'll be coming back to life again (Uh)
All or nothing, burn in hell or go up heaven sent, yeah (Uh)
Wheels up on the curb side, put it in speed drive
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash, I'm about to crash
I'm about to crash

I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary
I'm about to crash into the water
Gonna take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive
End it all so legendary

I'm about to, I'm about to crash
Come watch me, baby
I'm about to, I'm about to, I'm about to crash
Come watch me burn it all down
I'm about to, I'm about to crash
Into the water take you with me
I'm high voltage, self-destructive, end it all so legendary

// New Shapes //

What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
I ain't got it

I don't know why I got a tendency to run away
Don't know why I'm always pushing for a sweet escape
Even though I feel so close
I just can't control how I
Feel
And I gotta be free
Need to breathe
But sometimes I need

All night
All day
We could fall in love in new shapes
New shapes
When the morning comes
I'm sorry
I stayed
Tell you honestly, I can't change
Can't change

What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

What if I
Created places for you to let go
What if you
Wanted to watch because we both know
That now we are so close we don't have to fight how we feel
When the lights and the skins are a call so surrender to it

All night, all day
Then we fall in love in new shapes, new shapes
When the morning comes all misty, we fade
'Cause we fell in love in new shapes
In new shapes

What you want
I ain't got it (Got it)
What you want
(We could go on)
What you want
I ain't got it
I ain't got it

Thinking of me but you're stuck on the West side again
Maybe we're meant for another dimension, babe
Deep in the dark of your brain like a star in space
You call it art but you pulled out my heart
And you twisted it into a new shape
Yeah, I'm dive bombing again and again
Trying to get up close to you
Fucked if I know how it's gonna end
But honestly life would be better
If I never met you in the first place

What you want
I ain't got it (Yeah)
What you want
(I ain't got it)
What you want
I ain't got it
(Charli, Caroline, Chris)
What you want
(What you want, what you want)
I ain't got it (What you want)
What you want
I ain't got it
What you want
What you want
I ain't got it
(I ain't got it, baby)
I ain't got it

// Good Ones //

I wish you gave me, a reason
That you were better, at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seeing me low
I always let the good ones go

Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches, that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothing more than broke
I always let the good ones go

And baby you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones

Let you down easy, I'm trying
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fighting
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones, go

And baby you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Yeah, yeah)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And baby you couldn't have loved me any better, better, better)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(But doin' this is all that I've known ever, ever, ever)
I let the good ones go

// Constant Repeat //

I'm focused on you
You're all on me too
I'm cute and I'm rude
And you like what I do
You said I run through your mind
So I put love on the line
I scared you away
You missed the chance of a lifetime

When you're lonely
Are you ever thinkin' 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

Do you realise
I could have been the one to change your life?
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted
Do you even know
The reasons why you had to let me go? (Do you know?)
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted

I'm focused on you
You're all on me too
Told you I'm cute and I'm rude
With kinda rare attitude
You said I'm still on your mind
But now I don't have the time
You should have been brave
You missed the chance of a lifetime

When you're lonely
Are you ever thinkin' 'bout the magic in me?
Do you wish I was yours?
When you're lonely (When you're lonely)
Am I ever on your mind on constant repeat?
Is it me that you want?

Do you realise
I could have been the one to change your life?
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted
Do you even know
The reasons why you had to let me go? (Do you know?)
You could have had a bad girl by your side
You could have had a bad girl
Could have had a bad girl
If you wanted

Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat
Got me on repeat

// Beg For You //

You know I go insane
Every time you have to catch a flight
Ah, ah-ah
Can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights
Ah, ah-ah

Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss you, ooh
Something I can't forget
When I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed, mmm

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
'Cause I'll beg for you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Beg for you, beg for you
Beg for you, beg for you
Beg for you, beg for you
Oh, don't you leave me this way

You're like an ocean breeze
Coming and going just as you please
Ah, ah-ah
Separated by a degree
Hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach
Ah, ah-ah

Oh, put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss
On the nights when I miss you now
Something I can't forget
When I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed, mmm

Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you
'Cause I'll beg for you

My heart is aching
My breath, you take it
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way
This way

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way
This way

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me)

Don't leave me, don't leave me
This way, this way (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me)

Don't you leave me

Yeah, yeah, yeah

// Move Me //

I already know I'm letting go of something sacred
Drive us off the road, I take a good thing and I break it
Think it's it my soul, the way I run from something real, no, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life
Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down my by side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you

Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah, I think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life
Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down my by side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away

It's something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest night
Locked down by my side even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away (Push you away)

It's something 'bout the way you, the way you
Way you move me
Way you move me
Yeah, yeah
Move me

// Lightning //

Don't know what to say
One look and then you blew me away
I'm spiralling all over the place
So lifted, got me reaching for grace
Body off the ground

Caught me by surprise
Like seeing shooting stars in the sky
There's danger in the dark of your eyes
But something 'bout you breathes me to life
Got me here and now

Heartbreak already hit me once
They say that it won't happen twice

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning

Electrified with love on the line
So different every touch, every time
Connected by invisible wires
Don't you cut me out

Heartbreak already hit me once
So swear that it won't happen twice

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning

Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Lighting, lighting
Give it to ya, give it to ya
(Walk away, I'll follow my soul)
Blinded, blinded
Yeah, tell me what you want, tell me what you want

L-L-L-L-L-L-Lighting, l-l-l-l-l-l-lightning
Lightning
You're love- lightning

You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to ya
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uhh
So tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning

// Every Rule //

When I met you it was tragic
Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else in turn
And I was with somebody else as well
Met up late night by the Bowery
And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend

And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneaking around, falling deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breaking every rule for you
You're breaking every rule for me
I'm breaking every rule for you
But I've got to say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Straight away we started falling
Conversation never boring
When your lips brushed up against my skin
All I wanted was to let you in
I wonder if people would notice
Said you find it so hard to focus
Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

And we know that it's wrong
But it feels real fun
Sneaking around, falling deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's not fair
I'm hurting someone else instead

I'm breaking every rule for you
You're breaking every rule for me
I'm breaking every rule for you
But I've got to say
I want it this way
These moments really set me free

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

// Yuck //

Not supposed to feel this way
I'm such a hypocrite
I always frown on love
It's giving me a tummy ache (All these butterflies make me sick)
Make me fly away (It's some Hocus Pocus shit, I'm bewitched)
For what?

Calling too much, you're breaking my phone
Mad when you do and sad when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you taking my coat
Too cute, no, this ain't me now
Candlelight, out on a starry night
You brush my hair to the side
And you tell me I'm pretty

Yuck
Now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck
That boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck
Lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck
Quit acting like a puppy
Fuck
Going all lovey-dovey on me

You got your hopes high
Thinking 'bout it most nights
Put me on a pedestal
'Cause my loves incredible
Don't wait up for me
I can't make those plans
Catch me if you can
Just flew into Japan
Come catch me (But don't you catch feels, that's so)

Yuck
Now you got me blushin'
Cheeks so red when the blood start rushing
Yuck
That boy so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky
Yuck
Lookin' at me all sucky
Yuck
Quit acting like a puppy
Fuck
Going all lovey-dovey on me

All, lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
(Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
All lovey-dovey on
Yuck
All lovey-dovey on me
All lovey-dovey on
(Why you do this to me?)
All lovey-dovey on me
(Why you do that? Why you do that? Why you do that?)

Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that? Mmm
Yuck
Why you do that? Why you do that? (Mmm)
Yuck
(Why you do that to me?)
Yuck

// Used To Know Me //

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
You, you, you, you

You had me 'round your finger
You had me on the floor
I used to be your angel
Now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turning evil
I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection
Think I lost myself before

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, ohh

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, ohh

I'm like a flower blooming
Since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing
Thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turning evil
You said I lost my mind
No you ain't gon' do me like that

Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye
I'm on my own tonight, ohh

La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
(La-la-la-la) La-la-la-la-la-la
(Uh, yeah) La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la

You used to know me, now you don't

// Twice //

Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

When it's too much
There's a gun to my head
When it's too much
Got me feeling so scared
Yeah, real talk with my demons lately
Real talk in the mirror, save me
When it's too much
Gotta live life good, appreciate it

Nothing is forever
Lucky to remember
Stay up in the moment
All night, all night, yeah

All the things I love are gonna leave me
One day, you're never gonna be there
I tell myself to take it easy
Don't think twice about it, baby
Up on the hill, we'll see it all end
Die happy thinking 'bout my best friends
Till then I'm diving off the deep end
Don't think twice about it I say

"Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it"

When I let go
Let my body ascend
Let the love through
See the light at the end
Yeah, real talk with my demons lately
Real talk in the mirror, so brave
When let go
I'll say I lived life good, appreciated

Nothing is forever
Lucky to remember
Stay up in the moment
All night, all night, yeah

All the things I love are gonna leave me
One day, you're never gonna be there
I tell myself to take it easy
Don't think twice about it, baby
Up on the hill, we'll see it all end
Die happy thinking 'bout my best friends
Till then I'm diving off the deep end
Don't think twice about it, I say

"Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it

Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it
Don't think twice
Don't think twice
Don't, don't, don't think twice
Don't think about it"

Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice
Don't think, don't think twice

// Selfish Girl //

Romance never seems to be roses
Never happy endings, unless someone pretendin'
But sometimes it feels good to be lonely
Call it independence, done with this pretendin'

I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

One hand in the air at the party
Stuck in sound and vision, something like religion, oh
Don't try to light something I've started
Yeah, you might be different, but I told you that we're finished, oh

I cut you off, don't call my line
It's not 'cause I'm on guard, but I
Been hurt one too many times
And that's the reason why

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world, oh, oh, yeah

Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no
Can you handle that?
Can you handle that? Can you handle that?
Can you handle that?
No one really can, no, no

Hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish
Put your hands up if you're selfish, selfish

I'm a selfish girl
I've gotta put myself first
'Cause I'm a selfish girl
I only want the whole world

// How Can I Not Know What I Need Right Now //

Oh-oh

I tell good lies when they ask me
But I cried all night in the backseat
No one knows what I feel inside (I used to know what I wanted)
My tears fell down at the party
Like water all on my body
No one knows when I'm really alright

Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted
I'm high enough from all the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better

On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, oh

I broke down in Paris (Yeah)
Tried to hide my emotions (Come home)
All flew out my body (Yeah)
But then I cried hard in the hotel
Did that show in London
And I cried still at the party
Doesn't make me happy
How can I not know what I need right now?

Pulled apart my feelings so raw (Yeah, yeah)
Voices shout so loud, can't ignore (Every night, every night, yeah)
I used to think I knew what I wanted (I used to know what I wanted)
But I don't wanna feel the high pressure
I just wanna make myself better

On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
On Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, on

Feel so high in the trolley
Feel so high in the trolley
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, someday, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, someday, yeah, yeah
Someday, oh

// Sorry If I Hurt You //

I'm sorry if I-, I'm sorry if I-

I talked to you the way I talk to myself
I started taking you for granted and that's not right
Stop saying "thank you" when I needed your help
But still I'm taking you for granted and that's not right

I never really listen
But when you're gone a part of me is missing
I know it's complicated, we both feel the distance
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts

Floatin' in an atmosphere
Hiding from the truth in fear
Slowly we both disappeared
Now it seems so crystal clear
So in denial, oh, yeah

You never really listen
And when I'm gone a part of you is missing
I know it's complicated letting go of feelings
I really hope that you'll forgive me one day

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I only make it worse
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'm sorry if it hurts, oh

Ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm sorry if I-, I'm sorry if I-
Oh

// What You Think About Me //

Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no
Ooh, yeah, yeah

I might need a lot, I might need attention
I might wanna fight, I might not let it go
I love you so much, I'm so under pressure
You're choking my neck, you might not let me go

When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out 'cause I don't want it to hurt
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Ah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me (What?)
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (No)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (Huh)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Yeah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

When my blood is falling I can't see the light
I wanna prove a point 'cause it's in my design
We both got some demons to exorcise
Why say you hate me to feel alive? Yeah, yeah

When the lights are out and I feel a little low
That's when your noise is cruelest, when I really catch your bullets
Try to breathe it out, but when I talk, it makes it worse
It makes it harder when my name's on your shirt

But I don't give a fuck what you think about me (Nah)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you
'Cause I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)
I don't give a fuck what you think about me
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the things that you do (No)
And I don't give a fuck what you think about me
What you think about me, so yeah, fuck you (Fuck you)

Haha, haha
What you think about me
Fuck you
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
What you think about me
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Ah
