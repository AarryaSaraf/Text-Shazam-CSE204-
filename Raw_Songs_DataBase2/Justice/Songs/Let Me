Look at you girl, being as sexy as you wanna be
(Mm) I know you got a man so pardon me saying,
I think you have to be with me;
Somebody who will treat you more than right, somebody who will love you more than life
A man that will just be a man
Well baby, I guess all you gotta do is take my hand
And let me,

Let me show you what real love is made of,
Let me set you apart from the stars above,
Let me be the one who satisfies your needs,
Let me be the one who fills your dreams,

Let me show you what real love is made of,
Let me set you apart from the stars above,
Let me be the one who satisfies your needs,
Just let me be the one who fills your dreams,
Won't you let me 

(Ooh) (Ooh) (Oh baby) (Ooh)

Lady, the tears you shed aren't worth your gorgeous smile (No)
Your guy knows it but looks foolish, still in denial
How could he ever leave a  like you, sad and lonely 
Running around with other women, you're my one and only
Come on and hold me
Let me, yeah..

Let me show you what real love is made of,
Let me set you apart from the stars above,
Let me be the one who satisfies your needs,
Let me be the one who fills your dreams,

Let me show you what real love is made of,
Let me set you apart from the stars above,
Let me be the one who satisfies your needs,
Let me be the one who fills your dreams,

Can you taste it, the sweetness of love
Can you hear it, the soft cry of 
Baby can you smell it, the scent of our love
Do you see that, we'll never grow apart
Oh, can you feel it... that's this love of our's


What love is made of..
Baby I can show you what real love is made of
From the stars above..
I can set you on the stars
And satisfy your needs...
Just let me be the one who satisfies your needs
Just let me be the one who fills up your dreams


Let me show you what real love is made of,
Let me set you apart from the stars above,
Let me be the one who satisfies your needs,
Just me be the one who fills up your dreams
