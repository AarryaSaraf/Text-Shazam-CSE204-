// Oh No //

In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
all the calcified arithmatists were doing the math
And it would take a calculated blow to the head 
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths

oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths 
oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
calcium mines are buried deep in your chest 
oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest.

Ooh,
you're deep in a mine
Ooh,
a calcium mine
o-o-oh

let's get out of here
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.      

Ooh,
you're deep in a mine, o-o-oh
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no-no

arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
oh arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
in the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
oh the calcium mines buried deep in your chest.

Ooh,
deep in a mine, oh-no
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no

so let's get out of here 
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.

oh-no
oh-no
oh-no
oh-no

// Masterswarm //

Come what may
Lay your eggs where it's warm
We come here to swarm
Come by sea
Swarm like smoke in the dawn
We were the young
We were the swarm

Radiolarians
Midges and moths
Cut from a cloth
We were the young
We were the swarm

Flailing fetal fleas
Feeding from the arms of the master
Burrow into me
And this is sure to misspell disaster
Oh and the young in the larval stage
Orchestrating plays
In vestments of translucent alabaster

So they took me to the hospital
They put my body through a scan
What they saw there would impress them all
For inside me grows a man
Who speaks with perfect diction
As he orders my eviction
As he acts with more conviction
Than I

Oh, burrow into me
This is sure to misspell disaster
Oh, burrow into me
You're feeding from the arms of the master

We were the young
We were the swarm
We were the young
Radiolarians
[3x]

Come what may
Come what may
Come

// Fitz & Dizzyspells //

Comes and goes
Like the fits and dizzyspells, like the weather
And it gloats 
Like it knows whats going wrong, like its clever

Has a name, oh but the name goes unspoken
Where the veins oh are all twisted and broken.
Soldier on 
Soldier on
Soldier on

Flaring to the whirr of the snack machine
Muted screams of an old regime
And then oh, something gets in
But nausea gets in
and we were all fast asleep
we were all so fast asleep

but you woke up, woke up from the strangest dream
that an old regime could ever know
would ever know, would ever know

Lava flows over crooks and cragged cliffs to the ocean
and explodes in a steam heat fevered cyclical motion
Has a name but the name goes unspoken
its in vain 'cause that language is broken
Cast your own
Cast your own
Soldier on 
Soldier on
Soldier on

// Effigy //

If you come to find me affable
And build a replica for me
Would the idea to you be laughable
Of a pale facsimile

So when you come to burn an effigy
It should keep the flies away
When you learn to burn this effigy
It should be 
For the hours that slip away

It could be you, it could be me
Working the door, drinking for free
Carrying on with your conspiracies
Filling the room with a sense of unease
Fake conversations on a nonexistent telephone
Like the words of a man who's spent a little too much time alone
When one has spent too much time alone...

So if you come to burn my effigy
It should keep the flies away
When you learn to burn an effigy it should be 
Of a man whose lost his way, slips away

// Tenuousness //

Tenuous at best was all he had to say 
When pressed about the rest of it, the world that is
From proto-Sanskrit Minoans to Porto-centric Lisboans
Greek Cypriots and harbor sorts who hang around in ports a lot uh huh

Here's where things start getting weird
While chinless men will scratch their beards
And to their minds a sharpened axe 
Is brushed upon the Uralic syntaxes

Love of hate acts as an axis
Love of hate acts as an axis
First it wanes and then it waxes
So procreate and pay your taxes

Tenuousness, less seven comes to three
Them, you, us plus eleven 
Thank the heavens for their elasticity 
And as for those who live and die for astronomy

When coprophagia was writ
Know when to stand or when to sit
Can't stand to stand, can't stand to sit
And who would want to know this?
Click, click, click

Who wants to look upon this? 
Who wants to look upon this pray tell?
Who wants to look upon this?
Who wants to look upon this pray tell, pray tell?

Tenuousness, less seven comes to three
Them, you, us plus eleven comes just shy of infinity 
And as for those who live and die from numerology

// Nomenclature //

Just think of the lives you could swap with your own
While you're selling you're coats, you're sewing your own
And though it's not the easy way, 
sometimes we've got to pay to play
with finger paints and macromay
It's time we asked a see and say

Could you bring a different nomenclature?
Now the colors have bled to gray.
To ones that don't take distant nature.

Our nomenclature's washin away.
Washin Away.
Our nomenclature's washin away.
Washin away.

But did it carry you away?
Carry you all away?

Did it carry you away?
Carie you all away
Nomenclature's washin away
It's washing us all away
Nomenclature's washin away
It's washing us all away

// Not A Robot, But A Ghost //

I run the numbers through the floor
here's how it goes: I crack the codes
I crack the codes that end the war
I crack the codes that end the war

I pushed a note under your door
here's how it goes: things come to blows
but we don't want this anymore
No we don't want this anymore
We don't want this anymore

I crack the codes, you end the war

I hear the clockwork in your core
time strips the gears till you forget what they were for
I push the numbers through your pores
I crack the codes
I crack the codes that end the war

How's my view and
you can call
encrypted numbers
on bathroom stalls
there's something burning
it casts a pall
it's melting numbers
right off the wall

I run the numbers through the floor
here's how it goes: I crack the codes
I crack the codes, you end the war

// Anonanimal //

I see a sea anemone
The enemy
See a sea anemone
And that'll be the end of me.

While the vicious fish was caught unawares in the tenderest of tendrils
Underneath her tender gills

I will become this animal
Perfectly adapted to the music halls
I will become this animal
Anomalous appendages
A non-animal

Hold on just a second
Don't tell me this one you know
I know this one I know this song
I know this one I love this song
Hold on just a second
Don't tell me this one you know
i know this one I know this song
I know this one I love this song
I know this one

Underneath the stalactites
The troglobites lost their sight
Uh oh

The seemingly innocuous plecostomus
though posthumus
They talk to us
They talk too much

See a sea anemone
The enemy
See a sea anemone
That'll be the end of me
Vicious fish was caught unawares
In the tend'rest tendrils
Underneath her tender gills and

I will become this animal
Perfectly adapted to a music hall
I will become this animal

Anomalous appendages
A non-animal

// Natural Disaster //

Look upon the field of snow 
To find the desert sea
Under the ice the springs will flow to release
Fecundities like a natural disaster

From the first drop of water
To the rage of Niagara

Collapse upon the forest floor and down upon your knees
Anthurium Lacrimae decays underneath the canopies like a natural disaster
It's the one that's been happening over and over and over again

No peace in the valleys
Malarial alleys where the kittens have pleurisy
Donning our goggles
Valerian ogles
To see microscopically
A colony of dermestids 
Undressed and digested 
A grey spotted owl 
And a wolf with a lung disease

Collapse upon the forest floor and down upon your knees
Anthurium Lacrimae decays underneath the canopies like a natural disaster
It's the one that keeps happening over and over and over again

// The Privateers //

Don't sell me anything 
Your one time offer, so uncalled-for 
You call it peace of mind 

Cause I can see your house from here 
Now all the leaves have fallen, dear 
I can see you're just a little privateer 
As your confession draws more near 

Time and again, I find I'm listless 
Or rather, fistless 
In time, oh, that's what I find 

So carry me to Mecca 
With what you may divine 
Take me with you, take me with you 
Don't leave me behind 

Oh cause I, I don't want your life insurance 
Home, auto, health, flood, and fire insurance 
Oh, just make, please make this basic inference 
And speak of me in the present tense 

Oh cause I, I can see your ships from here 
Now all the weather's so bright and clear 
I can see you're just a little profiteer 
As your confession draws more near 

As your confession draws more near 

As your confession draws more near

// Souverian //

Though bells will ring
Church steeples were catchin fire
If you promise spring
Then I'll know you are a liar

Cause in the spring
Tender grasses won't burn easily
Tough thrushes sing
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips they still scald my lungs
While thistles will burn my feet

And if you join our chorus
You will never fear anymore
So here it comes the chorus
We will meet on a fatal shore

Souverian Souverian the elder
Souverian Souverian was free
Souverian Souverian we feld her
So very young so very young were we

Birds will sing
Still my lover won't return to me
You promise spring
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips scald my lungs
And thistles are burning my feet

So here it comes the chorus
You'll never fear anymore
If you join a chorus
We will meet on a fatal shore

Under the elders
The older get younger
The younger get over
Over their elders
Under the elders
Pretend that you're older now

Under the elders
The older get younger
The younger get over
Over the elders
Under the elders
Bending your branches down

We who are so very young
Still my lover won't return to me
Thrushes sing
Still my lover won't return to me
Wild parsnips they still scald my lungs
While thistles still burn my feet

// Section 8 City //

Section 8 city, section 8 city
Have you lied to us?

And something gets in it, 
Well something gets in it

It's not alright with us.

Section 8 city,
Have you lied to us?

Something gets in it, 
something gets in it

It's not alright with us.

And you're not so sure you want to go through with this
Not so sure.
Oh, with this live thing
It's a trifling, it's a trifling sight

Section 8 city, have you lied to us?
Something gets in it, well something gets in it

It's alright with us

Section 8 city, section 8 city,
Have you lied to us?

And something gets in it
Something gets in it

It's not alright with us

Section 8 city

Section 8 city lover
Section 8 city lover

Oh you're not so sure you want to go through with this
Not so sure, with this live thing
It's a trifling
Oh it's a trifling sight.

// Take Courage //

Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone
Then these words become to crumble like the sidewalks
all around this crumby neighborhood.
And from the chalky Cliffs of Dover, I'd come over,
I'd start over if I could.

From the tropic of Cancer, to Capricorn, 
you so far from your sofa along.
Now you spin dirty laundry
You dream of the kind of love you knew the day you're born

Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.

You swallow far from home
It's how you find your room

Though my words begin to crumble like the sidewalks
all around this crumby neighborhood.

And from these chalky Cliffs of Dover, I'd come over
I'd start over if I could.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, night's falling,
but you're not alone, no you're not alone. 
Take courage, take courage, 
that you're not along, no you're not alone.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Take courage, take courage, 
that you're not along, no you're not alone.
