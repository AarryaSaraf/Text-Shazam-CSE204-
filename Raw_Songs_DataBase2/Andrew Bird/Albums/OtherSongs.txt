// Capital Crimes //

We're a fine institution
We're using a test to decide
Like some kind of sick solution
Who should live and who should die

If I let go of your hand
It would be murder
Standing backwards, blindfold
At the top of the stairs
And you may wonder if I
I had assured her
As the birds were
Makin' figure eights
All around the square

If I let go of your hand
If I strayed from the laws of the land

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
For desert oceans keep on widening
It's been this way since the Pleistocene
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Desert oceans keep on widening
It's been this way since the Pleistocene, yeah

Capital crimes
Nickels and dimes all across the floor
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
No vital signs, ooh
You scored too high
Now you walk the floor
We will meet on that fatal shore

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?

// Distant Stations //

I found an old rock
In the dry dirt outside
The door of my motel room
It was a triangle
With soft, round edges
And a split down the middle of one corner
It was darker than English moss
Green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume

I waited for you
But I never told you where I was
It was you who taught me
How to write these kinds of equations
And I waited on the steps for you
And I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot
You taught me how to listen
To these
Distant stations (distant stations)
Distant stations (distant stations)
Distant stations

I saw the sky break
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rosebushes by the motel office
And I missed him
By a good yard or two
And I sang old songs from nowhere
Los Angeles to Albuquerque
I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry
And I prayed real hard for you

I waited for you
But I never told you where I was
It was you who taught me
How to write these kinds of equations
I waited on the steps for you
And I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot
You taught me how to listen
To these
Distant stations (distant stations)
Distant stations (distant stations)
Distant stations (distant stations)
Distant stations (distant stations)
I waited on the steps for you; distant stations
(Distant stations)
These kinds of equations; distant stations
(Distant stations)
The naked and the hungry; distant stations
(Distant stations) Aw yeah
I prayed real hard for you; distant stations
(Distant stations)

// Happy Day //

Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
I live before I die some day
Oh Lord, some day

Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
The one with eyes that say those words I cannot find

I hope I live before I die some day
Oh, some day
I hope there's tears of joy I cry
Some day
Lord, some day

Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
The one with eyes that say those words I cannot find

// I Felt A Funeral, In My Brain //

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain
And Mourners to and fro
Treading, treading till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through

And when they all were seated
A Service, like a Drum
Kept beating, beating till I thought
My Mind was going numb
(My mind was growing)

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again
Then Space – Space began to toll

As all the Heavens were a Bell
And Being, but an Ear
And I, and Silence, some strange Race
Wrecked, solitary, here

And then a Plank in Reason, broke
And I dropped down, and down
And hit a World, at every plunge
And Finished knowing – then
And Finished knowing

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again
Then Space – Space began to toll

I felt a Funeral, in my Brain
And Mourners to and fro
Treading, treading till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through

// Night Sky //

Sound is a wave, like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before

[CHORUS]
If I were the night sky
Here's my lullaby
Lullaby to leave by
If I were the night

What if we hadn't been born at the same time?
What if you're seventy five and I were nine?
Would I come visit you?
Bring you cookies in an old folks home?
Would you be there alone?

And when the late summer lightning
Fires off in your arms
Will I remember to breathe?
No, I never will, no
And the fire could convince you that I mean you no harm
Just wanna show you how not to need

[CHORUS]

What if we hadn't been each other at the same time?
Would you tell me all the stories
From when you were young and in your prime?
Would I rock you to sleep?
Would you tell me all the secrets you don't need to keep?
Would I still miss you?
Oh, would you then
Have been mine?

Sound is a wave, like a wave on the ocean
Moon plays the ocean like a violin
Pushing and pulling from shore to shore
Biggest melody you never heard before

[CHORUS]

// Pulaski At Night //

Half empty, half full
Cup runneth over
Horns of plenty, coffers full
We're starting over

Half empty, half full
Cup runneth over
Horns of plenty, coffers full
We're starting over

I write you a story
But it loses its thread
And all of my witnesses
Keep turning up, keep turning up dead

I paint you a picture
Of Pulaski at night
Come back to Chicago
City of, city of light

Come back to Chicago

I paint you a picture
But it never looks right
Cause I fill in the shadows
And block out the, I block out the light

I send you a postcard
It says, "Pulaski at night"
Greetings from Chicago
City of, city of light

Come back to Chicago
City of, city of light

Come back to Chicago

// Song Of Foot //

Sometimes when I am well fed and my mind...
doesn't have my best interests in mind [x2]
it's the times like these
that my feet, they speak and sing, cause they do so better than can my head

cause when I play any regular sort of tune
like a Shotish or a Waltz or a Jig or a Reel
or a Certims or a Hornpipe or a Polka
my fever will have nothing to do with the proper time
no my fever will have no to do with the proper time

times when I am well fed and my mind...
doesn't have my best interests in mind [x2]
it's the times like these
that my feet, they speak and sing, cause they do so better than can my head

let them speak their heady opinions though and you'll hear...
oil and butter [x2]
lots of oil, lots of butter
oil and butter

// Spanish For Monsters //

All alone now, guess I'm satisfied
All alone now, guess I'm satisfied

Lil' bit older now, guess I'm satisfied

What a dream life would seem
If only they'd let you keep your etch-a-sketch

What a dream life would seem
If only they'd let you keep your etch-a-sketch

// The Crown Salesman //

Bring me your trembling masses
Sunday best
Tiptoe around the elephant
She needs her rest

I am your crown salesman
I'm the one who's running this job
Call me your crown salesman
I've got your list

A little bit Illuminati
A little Land of the Lost
Why do you wanna complicate it?
Why do you wanna complicate it?

I am your crown salesman
I'm the one who's running this job
Call me your crown salesman
I got your list

// The Gotholympians //

My pitiful sorrows have seen more tomorrows than yours
My rain really pours
At least more than yours
At least more than yours

In the depths of my sadness there's a beautiful madness you see
It's right here on my sleeve
You must not believe
I can see you just don't believe

So I really have to say it's all just so romantic
Cause I've seen the others try and they just seem pedantic

Cause when it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
No one competes with me

My sweeping emotions have spanned the great oceans
From this fifty foot wave I just can't be saved
O don't even try
I can't be saved

My pitiful sorrows have seen more tomorrows than yours
My rain really pours
At least more than yours
At least more than yours

So I really have to say it's all just so romantic
Cause I've seen the others try and they just seem pedantic

Cause when it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
No one competes with me

// Twa Sisters //

Two young sisters were walking alone
By the pale muddy waters
Two young sisters were walking alone 
By the pale muddy waters of Onion town

When one of them pushed the younger in
Into the cold green water
Pushed her sister and watched her drown
In the cold muddy froth of a river

Well she floated, and she floated down
For pale she was as the water
Floated down till she washed on shore
Of the pale muddy banks of Onion town

With wolves by night and the sun by day
Nothing was left but bones and hair
Bones and hair which are both more fair 
Then the pale muddy banks of the river

Lucha's son was deaf and lame
Carried her home, her tiny frame
Father, father i hear her cry
How can that be he said, bones don't cry he said (besides your deaf)

But he thought there must be something to these bones so he...

Made a fiddle out of her breast bone
Made some pegs out of her finger bones
Made a bow out of her leg bone
And from her yellow hair he strung the strings that would have her story sung

Some time later...

One old woman was walking alone
By the pale muddy water
She heard the strings of the sweet fiddle cry 
"Cruel sister why have you drowned me?"

Upon the rock the deaf boy played
All the bows of Onion
And into the water the cruel sister ran 
But she sank just like any old stone

// Venus in Furs //

Shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorned, imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there

I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

Kiss the boot of shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart

Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me

I am tired, woah, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams, oh, that would awake me
Different colors made of tears

(Ooh)Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
(Ooh) Whiplash girlchild in the dark
(Ooh) Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
