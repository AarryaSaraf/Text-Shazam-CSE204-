Since I first saw him, I think myself blind.
I look around me, and it's only him I see.
His image floats before me,
So gentle and so kind, he has got a clear mind and firm courage
Oh, ring upon my finger, little golden ring
Devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart
Sisters come adorn me, banish foolish fear
Twine upon my furrowed brow the blossoming myrtle
I serve him and live for him
Belong wholly to him
Give myself and find myself transfigured by his brightness
Ring upon my finger, little golden ring
Devoutly I press you to my lips and to my heart
The blissful dream of childhood has ended
Now I drink delicious death with you my love
Now you have me caused me my first pain- 
That really hurt.
You sleep, you hard cruel man, the sleep of death
The veil falls, the bell tolls, the black shawls, the carriage rolls
You, my whole world.
