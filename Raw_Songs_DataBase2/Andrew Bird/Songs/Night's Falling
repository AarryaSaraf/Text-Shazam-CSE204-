Night's falling
But you're not alone, no you're not alone
Take courage
That you're not alone, no you're not alone

When your words begin to crumble
Like the sidewalks all around this crummy neighborhood
From the chalky cliffs of Dover
I'd come over, I'd start over if I could

Night's falling
But you're not alone, no you're not alone
Take courage
That you're not alone, no you're not alone

Young swallow far from home
Some follow, some run

Take courage
'Cause night's falling
And you don't have a home
Take courage
'Cause night's falling
And you're on your own
