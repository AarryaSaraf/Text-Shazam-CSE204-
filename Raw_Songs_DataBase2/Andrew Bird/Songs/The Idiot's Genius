Viridian green
Was the color that triggered
The relapse that brought on
The idiot's genius,

Viridian green was
Mossy and seamless,

The insidious dream
Was white lighted arenas
Intolerable boredom
That washed, peeled, and cored him
Incalculable fear, invertible spheres,

Insidious dream was
The idiot's genius
