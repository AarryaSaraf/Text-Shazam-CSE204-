Some of these days you'll miss your honey
Some of these days I'll be going away
Some of these days you'll miss your honey
You know you're going to miss me sweet darling I'm going away
Some of these days you'll be sorry
Some of these days I'll be going away
Some of these days you'll miss your honey
You know your going to miss me sweet darling I'm going away
You will never know what your friend will do if they're going away
She will miss him oh little honey
She will miss him for I'm going away
Some of these days, oh little honey you know you're going to miss me sweet darling
I'm going away

You will never know what your friend will do if they're going away
She will miss him oh little honey
She will miss him for I'm going away
Some of these days oh little honey you know you're going to miss me sweet darling
I'm going away
