I'm goin' on home now guess I'm satisfied
Please tell me 'cause I don't know
While I'm splayed out on the floor
What it's like what it's like to be satisfied

I'm all alone now guess I'm satisfied
Last night, last night, lordy
How I cried

Little bit old now guess I'm satisfied
Please tell me 'cause I don't know
While I'm splayed out on the floor
What it's like to be satisfied
