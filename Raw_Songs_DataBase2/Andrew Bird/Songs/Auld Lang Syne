Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

Well we two have run about the braes
And pou'd the gowans fine
But we've wandered many a weary foot
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

We two have paddled in the burn
From morning sun till dine
But seas between us braid have roared
Since auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

And there's a hand my trusty fiere
And gie's a hand o' thine
And we'll tak' a right gude-willie waught
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup of kindness yet
For auld lang syne
