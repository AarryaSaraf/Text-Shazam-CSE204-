Used to have just one foot out the door
Yeah, I always wanted more
I always was the one
You thought would never marry
Used to be willfully obtuse
(or is the word abstruse?)
Semantics like a noose
Get out your dictionaries

I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

So tell me, are you serious?
Are you serious?
Cause every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious!
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it?

I see that you're down there and on the pier
Your boyfriend's gone to get a beer
Leaving us crystal clear lines of communications
Promise me you won't avert your eyes
I drop my flippers in disguise
You know it's time to do or die
No useless explanations

I'm gonna cut to the quick
This is all non-fiction
Words you beat with a stick
These are my true convictions

Tell me, are you serious?
Are you serious?
Every night of your life
You'll fight for it
So mysterious
How imperious!
But are you serious
When it really comes down to it?
