Listen you don't know
You don't know my mind
When what you thought was the core
Turned out to be the rind
If I need your advice
I will let you know
But listen until then
This is no call-in show
No, No, No
Cause I tell you a story
'Bout what happened today
Nothing profound
Just something to say
And you write a prescription
On your notebook pad
For five different ailments
Didn't know I had
Listen you don't know
You don't know my mind
Listen you don't know
You don't know my mind
You thought the core was the rind

I tell you a story
'Bout what happened today
Nothing profound
Just something to say
And you write a prescription
On your notebook pad
For five different ailments
Didn't know I had
Listen you don't know
You don't know my mind
Listen you don't know
You don't know my mind
You thought the core was the rind
