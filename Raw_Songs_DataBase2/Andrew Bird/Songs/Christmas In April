I wanted to hold you and keep you with me, this year
You're my darling and I want you near
I wanted to whisper sweet words of comfort in your ear
No more sorrow and no more fear

Oh, my love
When will we know
If we can meet under the mistletoe?

And I'm writing this song about Christmas in April this year
So I'm not sure what to think about that
And I'm hoping these words don't ring so hollow when you hear
You say "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"

Fits and starts, upset apple carts
Conspiring to keep us apart

I wanted to hold you and keep you with me, this year
You're my darling and I want you near
I'm hoping these words don't ring so hollow when you hear
You say "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"
And maybe all the winds blow away all our fears
Said "Merry Christmas" and "Happy New Year"
