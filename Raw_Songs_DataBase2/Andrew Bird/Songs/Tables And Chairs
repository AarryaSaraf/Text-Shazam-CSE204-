If we can call them friends we can call them on red telephones
and they won't pretend that they're too busy or they're not alone
if we can call them friends we can call
holler at 'em down these hallowed halls
just don't let the human factor fail to be a factor at all

don't
don't you worry
about the atmosphere
or any sudden pressure change

'cause I know
that it's starting
to get warm in here
and things are
starting to get strange

and did you
did you see how
all our friends were there
drinkin' roses from the can

how
how I wish I
I had talked to them
and wished they
fit into my plan

and we were tired of being mild
oh so tired of being mild
we were so tired

I know we're gonna meet someday in the crumbled financial institutions of this land
there will be tables and chairs
pony rides and dancing bears
there'll even be a band
'cause listen after the fall there'll be no more countries
no currencies at all
we're gonna live on our wits
throw away survival kits
trade butterfly knives for adderal
and that's not all
woah!
there will be snacks, there will
there will be snacks!
