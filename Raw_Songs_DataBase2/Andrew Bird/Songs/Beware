Step right on up, take a good good look
At the latest pie that fate could cook
This is no phenom, no supermarket guru
Just a revelation from me to you
So don't believe a thing that you might hear
At least from the last 30 - 40 years
'Cause it wasn't long ago, just before the reign of Nero
We had no concept of zero
So beware, children beware, the devil may care
Six little soldiers with stripes on their shoulders
Never with a thought to dare
So take aim, children, take aim
The drill sergeant sang
With ample perspiration ordered
"Stop your respiration"
And end the flow of oxygen to the brain
So wake up sleepyheads, listen what I have to say
As you near, near your independence day
Just keep in mind, in time you'd find so few
Have your best interests in mind
So don't believe a thing you might hear
At least from the last 30 - 40 years
'Cause it wasn't long ago, just before the reign of Nero
We had no concept of zero (none at all)
So beware
The devil may care
And maybe he's the only one
