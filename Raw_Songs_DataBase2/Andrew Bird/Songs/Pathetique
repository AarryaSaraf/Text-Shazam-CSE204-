I bear no grudge, even though my heart may break
Eternally lost love! I bear no grudge
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long time, I bear no grudge

Ich grolle nicht, und wenn das Herz auch bricht
Ewig verlornes Lieb! Ich grolle nicht
Though you're shining in your diamond splendor
No ray of light falls on the darkness of your heart
I've known it well for a long time, I bear no grudge

I saw you in a dream
I saw the darkness in your heart
I saw the snake that feeds upon your heart
I saw, my love, how utterly wretched you are
I bear no grudge, I bear no grudge
I'm over you, so come on come on ... come on back to me, okay?
Alright
