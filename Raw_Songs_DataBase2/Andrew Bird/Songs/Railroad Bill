Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill
Never worked and he never will
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well, Railroad Bill was a mighty mean man
Shot the light out of the brakeman's hand
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well Miss McMillan, she whooped and she squawked
That's my husband for I heard him fall
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well I went down on Number One
Railroad Bill had just begun
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well I came back on Number Two
Railroad Bill had just got through
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well I went down on Number Four
Someone let fly with a forty-four
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Got a thirty-eight special in a forty-five frame
I ain't gonna miss 'cause I've got dead aim
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well Railroad Bill, rolling down a hill
Lighting cigars with a ten-dollar bill
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well, Railroad Bill says, Before I die
I'm gonna build a railroad for the bums to ride
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill
