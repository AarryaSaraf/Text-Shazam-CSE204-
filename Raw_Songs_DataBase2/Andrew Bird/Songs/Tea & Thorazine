I can tell by the way you take your infusion
you've spent some time in a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
they let you keep your etch-a-sketch

you laugh like a banshee gesticulate your delirium
they treat you like a corpse keep you full of candy lithium
what a dream life would seem if if you could see
the world from inside an etch-a-sketch

I can tell by the way you reach your conclusions
you're the director of a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
it hadn't been for Doctor B.

animate yourself an alternate reality
consummate a self-pleasing artificiality
you can have yourself a tea

I can tell by the way you take your infusion
you've spent some time in a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
they let you keep your etch-a-sketch
