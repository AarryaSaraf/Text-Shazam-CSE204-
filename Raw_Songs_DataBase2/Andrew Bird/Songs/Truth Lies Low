Here's a little game
You can play along
Oh you do the walk of shame
From the comfort of your home
So here's another game
You can play along
Where you empty all your blame
From your guilty bones

Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, will know (the eyes will know)
Like a thousand tiny suns that glow (they're burning a hole)
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes will know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

So here's another game...

Fools are taking aim
They got pistols in their phones
Holocene is on the wane
We got plastic in our stones

Oh the lies, the lies, the lies will grow (the lies will grow)
Like a thousand tributaries flow (the eyes will know)
Oh the eyes, the eyes, the eyes, will know
While truth lies low
While truth lies low

Vitriol from their pens flows
Anonymously their hate grows
But at least they care enough
At least they care enough
At least they care enough
To let you know
