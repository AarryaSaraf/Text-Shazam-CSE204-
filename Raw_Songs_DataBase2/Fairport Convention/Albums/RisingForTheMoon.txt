// Restless //

Born between a river and a railroad
Restlessness has ruled me since I can't remember when
There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

There are dreams that I have carried all my lifetime
And the dreams have made me a stranger in the eyes of many a man
For I do not count the time and my reasons do not rhyme
And down the line and on my way, on my way again

Oh, rolling along like a shipwrecked sailor
Who never finds a home
Broken lines and signs of failure
Rub me to the bone

Well, I'm weary of the company of strangers
I'm weary of the city with its heart of hollow stone
Something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again

There's something in the wind seems to call me like a friend
So I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
Yes, I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
Yes, I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again
I guess that I'll be on my way, on my way again...

// White Dress //

Feel how the wind blows, December despair
Bring me a ribbon to tie up my hair
I'll be your bride, go where you go
All of my life, you'll be my beau

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

The night's in your face, sky's in your eyes
The day's in my arms when you're by my side
Whenever you're weary I'll sing you a song
Whenever you're lonely I'll show you you're wrong

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

Come from the window, let's climb the stairs
All of my sorrows are none of your cares
While life is in us, let's love all we can
I'll be your woman if you'll be my man

Kiss me and I might
Put on the white dress
If you'll take me dancing tonight

// Let It Go //

There's no excuse for torture, that you ought to know
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Yonder stands a scarecrow, he's hollow in his robes
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
The song was only in our time
They'll call it long, long ago
They'll say, "Ah well, it was their best"
Let it go, let it go
The master and the mistress a-trying hard to show
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Now there is not time for shame or tears on a window pane
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Eyes were made to smile and water
Tears were made to flow
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
There's a game that would have bought you
Were you ever set to throw
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go

// Stranger To Himself //

He was a stranger to himself
A spy in his own camp
And his money was his health
All thrown to the dust by his very own hand
Yet his beauty lingered still
Beyond the draining of the sand
But greener was the other side of the hill
Richer was the other man's land
But we loved him, loved him just like brothers would
We loved him, loved him like no others could
And she loved him, loved him like a lover should
Take good care of an aching heart
You never can replace it
You know you are the master of your heart
You'll realize that when you think it fit
Those orbs of blue are jading away
No laughter from them dances
Yet you're bound to remember this one day
Hazards are risks and risks are chances
You can run for cover, run for cover like a frightened hare
Till it's all over, all over and there's no one there
'Cause you daren't discover, daren't discover that we really care

// What Is True? //

Silver tongues are speaking long and hard into the night
I must be myself and I'll do all right
Oh, please my darling, do not make me sad
Late at night nobody really wants to feel that bad
The rain it beats impatiently upon the window pane
I must close my ears or I'll go insane
Can't you be a gentle breeze or silent as a snowfall
Won't you try and listen for the voice behind the wall
It cries to you
Even though it only ever whispers part of what it knows
And it's never ventured through the locks
Where the brazen river flows
It's the fingerprint which is never made
It's the perfume of a rose
And it is there if you are searching
But the moment must be right
As the night is black, as the day is white
Please my friend, help to make me glad
Help me find the one and only thing I've never had
What is true

// Iron Lion //

Now I've been an engine driver all of my days
That's the only thing I can do
I hold a good head of steam everywhere that I'm seen
Wherever my wheels rolled through
Wherever my wheels rolled through

Well, I was nearly shut down in a Midwest town
Her hair was red, her eyes were blue
But the wheels on the track kept calling me back
So I bid that girl adieu
Yes, I bid that girl adieu

Blow whistle, steel wheels keep on humming
Hold on darling your engine driver's coming
He's coming through

Some day I'll have to give up the iron line
And then I'll know just what I will find
I'll find me some shack by some old railroad track
So I can hear them motors whine
So I can hear them motors whine

Blow whistle, hear them steel rails humming
Hold on darling your engineer is coming
He's coming through

Now I've been an engine driver all of my days
That's the only thing I can do
I hold a good head of steam anywhere that I'm seen
Anywhere my trains rolled through
Anywhere my trains rolled through

Blow whistle, hear that steel rail humming
Hold on girl your engine driver's coming
Coming to you

// Dawn //

Morning shone among the shadows
Sunlight bled upon the silence
From the blackest night
Must come the morning sky
But yesterday was such a long time
Yesterday may last forever
From the barren land
Yesterday might always rise

Sleep, will we ever sleep
Oh, to sleep in peace once again my love

Tears are falling in the darkness
Hearts are bleeding in the silence
From the widest ocean
Who would miss this smallest tear
Then might always be a bad time
Then might always last forever
But these stormy clouds
We may see them all disappear

Hope has she really gone
Will she ever come back again my love

Sleep, will we ever sleep
Oh, to sleep in peace once again to love

Hope has she really gone
Will she ever come home again my love

// After Halloween //

Red and gold and Halloween have passed us by
The charcoal branches lean against the rosy sky
You are so far away and I could touch you if I may
But don't you worry now, I'm only dreaming anyway
You may be lonely, you may be just on your own
It could be anywhere, some place that I have know
But who am I and do we really live these days at all
And are they simply feelings we have learnt and do recall
Oh, the sea has made me cry
But I love her too, so maybe I love you
Tears are only made of salt and water
And across the waves the sound of laughter
October has gone and left me with a song
That I will sing to you although the moment may be wrong
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway
Could it be the sea's as real as you and I?
I often wonder why I always have to say
I'm only dreaming anyway

// Night-Time Girl //

Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Whiles her time away combing up her yellow hair
Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Looking in the mirror with a wide eyed stare

Night-time girl, when she's eager for the city
Dresses for the ball and she looks so young and pretty
Night-time girl, when she's eager for the city
Dresses for the ball and she looks so young and pretty

Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Isn't that a crying shame

Night-time girl, maybe all these changes
Are stages of what I'm hoping
Hard luck girl, your peace of mind
Must seem a long time coming

Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Isn't that a crying shame

Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Whiles her time away combing up her yellow hair
Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Looking in a mirror with a wide eyed stare

Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Isn't that a crying shame

// One More Chance //

Calling all olive branches and laid off doves
There is work to do before we say goodbye
But who can see them turning to the face of love
Though I hear them pleading with me, don't let us die
As I sit I can see their troubled souls wander by
And I feel them leaning on my shoulder to cry
Oh, one more chance

Naked tree of winter seems to stand so proud
Lording the poor mortal as he goes
And the tears which well beneath his somber shroud
Will they fall with the shame of somebody who knows
He can never be like the thought of a rose
Whose beauty remains, even when the bloom goes
Oh, oh, one more chance

Or is it too late to change the ways we're bound to go
Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know
Is it too late to change the ways we're bound to go
Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know
Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know
Is it too late to change the ways we're bound to go
Is it too late, there's surely one of us must know
