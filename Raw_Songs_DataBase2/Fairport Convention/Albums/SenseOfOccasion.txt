// Tam Lin //

I forbid you maidens all that wear gold in your hair
To travel to Carterhaugh for young Tam Lin is there

None that go by Carterhaugh but they leave him a pledge
Either their mantles of green or else their maidenhead

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

She'd not pulled a double rose, a rose but only two
When up then came young Tam Lin, says "Lady, pull no more"

"And why come you to Carterhaugh without command from me?"
"I'll come and go," young Janet said, "and ask no leave of thee"

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to her father as fast as go can she

Well, up then spoke her father dear and he spoke meek and mild
"Oh, and alas, Janet," he said, "I think you go with child"

"Well, if that be so," Janet said, "myself shall bear the blame
There's not a knight in all your hall shall get the baby's name"

For if my love were an earthly knight as he is an elfin grey
I'd not change my own true love for any knight you have"

Janet tied her kirtle green a bit above her knee
And she's gone to Carterhaugh as fast as go can she

"Oh, tell to me, Tam Lin," she said, "why came you here to dwell?"
"The Queen of Faeries caught me when from my horse I fell

And at the end of seven years she pays a tithe to Hell
I so fair and full of flesh and feared it be myself

But tonight is Hallowe'en and the faerie folk ride
Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must bide

First let past the horses black and then let past the brown
Quickly run to the white steed and pull the rider down

For I'll ride on the white steed, the nearest to the town
For I was an earthly knight, they give me that renown

Oh, they will turn me in your arms to a newt or a snake
But hold me tight and fear not, I am your baby's father

And they will turn me in your arms into a lion bold
But hold me tight and fear not and you will love your child

And they will turn me in your arms into a naked knight
But cloak me in your mantle and keep me out of sight"

In the middle of the night she heard the bridle ring
She heeded what he did say and young Tam Lin did win

Then up spoke the Faerie Queen, an angry queen was she
Woe betide her ill-fard face, an ill death may she die

"Oh, had I known, Tam Lin," she said, "what this night I did see
I'd have looked him in the eyes and turned him to a tree"

// Polly On The Shore //

Come all you wild young men and a warning take by me
Never lead your single life astray or into bad company
As I myself have done, being all in the month of May
When I, as pressed by a sea captain, a privateer to trade
To the East Indies we were bound to plunder the raging main
And it's many the brave and a galliant ship we sent to a watery grave
Ah, for Freeport we did steer, our provisions to renew
When we did spy a bold man-of-war sailing three feet to our two
Oh, she fired across our bows, "Heave to and don't refuse
Surrender now unto my command or else your lives you'll lose"
And our decks they were sputtered with blood and the cannons did loudly roar
And broadside and broadside a long time we lay till we could fight no more
And a thousand times I wished myself alone, all alone with my Polly on the shore
She's a tall and a slender girl with a dark and a-rolling eye
And here am I, a-bleeding on the deck and for a sweet saint must lie
Farewell, my family and my friends, likewise my barley too
I'd never have crossed the salt sea wide if I'd have been ruled by you
And a thousand times I saw myself again, all alone with my Polly on the shore

// The Vision //

I heard a voice calling out to me
It might have been a vision, might have been a dream
But some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment, don't you know?

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
Time and way

There's a bridge that leads us to the other side
You will know you've crossed it when you arrive
And everyone will have such a tale to tell
I'm going to quench my thirst when I drink from that well

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way...

I heard a voice calling out to me
It might have been a vision, might have been a dream
But some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment, don't you know?

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
Our time and way...

I heard a voice calling out to me

// Best Wishes //

Long may the sun shine on your bones and on your skin
Long may good fortune shine upon your kith and kin
Long may the laughter lines grow into your face
Long may you mastermind a perfect state of grace

May you always love and season well and keep good company
May you always act and reason well, wherever you may be
And long may the music keep you gentle and in thrall
And long may its beauty shine to pleasure one and all

Long may your passion take a stand against all wrongs
And long may the fashion last that welcomes all your songs
Long may your journey take you down a friendly road
And long may you learn the ways that lighten up your load

May you always keep good melody and never lose your key
May you always keep your memory and keep your spirit free
And long may the music keep you underneath its spell
And long may you keep it live and always play it well
