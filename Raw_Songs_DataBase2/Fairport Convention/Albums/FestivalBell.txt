// Rising For The Moon //

I travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon

There's a heart in every place, there's a tear for each farewell
For that's the way it is, that is my fortune
I'll lure you as the lace that the wayward gypsies sell
With the sinking of the sun, rising of the moon

Rising for the moon, the sun has set and it is dark
But the star of the enchanted tune is bright as any spark
The chorus of the dusk regail the evening lark
Whose every day does start rising for the moon

We travel over the sea and ride the rolling sky
For that's the way it is, that is our fortune
There are many ears to please, many people's love to try
And every day's begun rising for the moon

// Rui's Guitar //

The lazy hazy day is picking up the heat
On ripening fields of maize, hot earth beneath my feet
Guess I'll hit the road to find you
Let luck decide who gives the ride

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar

The verge is full of flowers that come up year on year
Sunshine into showers, still no one's passing here
I need someone to remind me
Of water good, my memory's blurred

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar

The sailor and the song, the danger and bravado
Of how he carried on when the loneliness had found him
Throwing dice for the direction
Of the breeze, through random seas

Oh, heaven help the soul that never finds its home
Forever in a hole, always far too wrong
Now the headlights blind my eyes
Redeeming light, into the night

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar

// Reunion Hill //

Must've been in late September
When last I climbed Reunion Hill
Fell asleep on Indian Boulder
Dreamed a dream I will not tell

I came home as the sun went down
One eye trained upon the ground
Even now I find their things
Glasses, coins and golden rings

It's ten years since that ragged army
Limped across these fields of mine
Gave them bread, I gave them brandy
Most of all I gave them time

My well is deep and the water pure
The streams are fed by mountain lakes
I cleaned the brow of many a soldier
Dowsing for my husband's face

I won't forget our sad farewell
And how I ran to climb that hill
To see him walk across the valley
And disappear into... the trees

Alone there in a sea of blue
It circles every afternoon
A single hawk in god's great sky
Looking down with god's own eyes

It soars above Reunion Hill
And I pray he spirals higher still
As if from such an altitude
He might just keep our love... in view

Must've been in late September
When last I climbed Reunion Hill

// Around The Wild Cape Horn //

I was born a land-bound farm boy and in New England raised
The rippling of the wheat fields, well they were my ocean waves
Each rise and fall, each cry and call, of the crows across the corn
Were seagulls swooping around the bow
Of the ship I dreamed I'd sail around Cape Horn

My deck was the dusty farmyard, my mast was the telegraph pole
The windblown whine in the telegraph wire, was the sound called in my soul
And it seemed to have been singing since the day that I was born
You're gonna take a trip on a sailing ship
All the way around the wild Cape Horn

Well, I found that ship in Hamburg and her name it was Peking
Our skipper's name was Jervis, well I never met a man like him
He pulled two men out from the sea, by the hair, in a raging storm
And he kept that grip on the sailing ship
All the way around the wild Cape Horn

Well, the cargo weighed five thousand tons, the ship three thousand more
An acre of sail was up aloft, some seventeen stories tall
And we had a pig and a scruffy dog and a turkey fed on corn
Willing hands to drive her on
All the way around the wild Cape Horn

Well, its four hours on and its four hours off
And you sleep in your wet clothes
The only dry thing on the ship is the cargo down below
Eleven thousand miles we sailed, nigh on one hundred dawns
Thirty two sails on a heaving ship
Hauling us around the wild Cape Horn

Seventeen days we were becalmed, then Friday the thirteenth
Sixty-eight great ships were lost in the storm of the century
We blew into the Atlantic on a sunlit sparkling morn
The turkey got sick, so we ate him quick
On the way around the wild Cape Horn

We lost two boys along the voyage, they got washed overboard
Silence from us down below, no one could put in words
Two empty bunks to mark the space, their two lives to mourn
Torn between all life and death
All the way around the wild Cape Horn

Well, she had us sort of hypnotized
No time to catch our breath
If you want to love your life, you have to flirt with death
Sail close to the harnessed wind and treat all risks with scorn
A farm boy and an unyoked team
Ploughed their way around the wild Cape Horn

Mountain waves like avalanches, crashed upon the decks
The screaming winds ripped ropes and spars and tried to have us wrecked
But she rose and fell through foam and swell, her sails all ripped and torn
Eight thousand tons, tossed like a cork
We made it 'round the wild Cape Horn

Well, she had us sort of hypnotized
No time to catch our breath
If you want to love your life, well you have to flirt with death
Sail close to the harnessed wind and treat all risks with scorn
A farm boy and an unyoked team
Ploughed their way around the wild Cape Horn
A farm boy and an unyoked team
Ploughed their way around the wild Cape Horn

// Celtic Moon //

There's a lady who carries a burden
And the lines on her face tell it all
She remembers hearing sad stories
But still dances at Memory Hall

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon

Once a young girl, with rings on her fingers
Given to her by a boy she once loved
Barefoot, they sat by the river
Sharing secrets with god up above

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon

On a cold night by the roadside she rested
Pale was her skin, tired and worn
Her beauty had faded through grieving
She was too tired to weep, too tired to mourn

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon

// The Festival Bell //

1690 was the year, a bell was cast in Chacombe
William Bagley was the name, the foundry man the made them
With another five before, the lowest was a tenor
Settling for a six peal in the old church tower

There was such a gathering, all to bring the new year in
The captain of the ringers was a man named William Jack
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

Hold on to the tenor when the treble it is going
Be sure to watch the changes now you know that she is gone
Look to sally for a clue, then you'll know just what to do
We'll have to have a silent bell 'cos Bob's not here

Is he in the Red Lion? Maybe in the Brasenose?
Funny but you'd think that he was practising from there
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

So, still, in the tower waiting for the ringers
Centuries go by, still our voices sing

They ring throughout all Oxfordshire and out across the nation
Even in America, maybe Russia too
For every year in August there's another celebration
Peace and love, rock and roll, and Wadworth's too

Every act that takes the stage, all the music that is played
Is cast into a symbol in the old church tower
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

Every act that takes the stage, all the music that is played
Is cast into a symbol in the old church tower
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell
