// Matty Groves //

A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year
Lord Darnell's wife came into church, the gospel for to hear

And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd

"Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light"

"Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are Lord Darnell's wife"

"What if I am Lord Darnell's wife? Lord Darnell's not at home
For he is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home"

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Darnell he would know before the sun would set

And in his hurry to carry the news he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad mill stream he took of his shoes and he swam

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Darnell was standing at his feet

Saying "How do you like my feather bed? And how do you like my sheets?
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?"

"Oh, well I like your feather bed, and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep"

"Well, Get up, get up", Lord Darnell cried "Get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man"

"Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket-knife"

"Well it's true I have two beaten swords, and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse"

"And you will strike the very first blow, and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Darnell sore
Lord Darnell struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more

And then Lord Darnell he took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying, "Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?"

And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
"I'd rather kiss from dead Matty's lips, than you with your finery

Lord Darnell he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall

"A grave, a grave!" Lord Darnell cried, "to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin"

// Sloth //

Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun

Now the right things, the wrong things
No more excuses to come
Just one step at a time
And the war has begun

Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun

She's run away, she's run away
And she ran so bitterly
Now call to your colours, friend
Don't you call to me

Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun

Don't you cry, don't you cry
Don't you cry upon the sea
Don't you cry, don't you cry
For your lady and me

Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum
Just a roll, just a roll
And the war has begun

// Rosie //

I know Rosie
You're living in a world you didn't make
And I know it's hard feeling happy
When the things you want aren't even there to take

Come on Rosie, rosin up the bow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Lie down cozy and let's learn to take things slow
For the more I learn it's the less I seem to know
Of my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie, rosin up the bow

Throw away your uniform
Now's the time to take things by the hand
Come on in and take your coat off
Settle down and listen to the band
And ain't that grand, Rosie

// John The Gun //

"My shadow follows me
Wherever I should chance to go"
John the Gun did say
"If you should chance to meet me
As I wander to and fro
Sad would be your day

My life is mine and the light did shine
Till the guns they did go through me
So now I shall never fall
Ideals of peace are gold which fools have found
Upon the plains of war
I shall destroy them all"

Put away your guns of steel
Death comes too soon for all
Your Master He may need you soon
And you must heed His call

"I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play
So I will teach your sons
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days
Why, then they will die young"

"Condemn me not
For always will I play the game of war
In moonshine or in sun
And if any cross the path I choose to tread
Their chances they are poor
My name is John the Gun"

Something you got, baby

Something you got, baby

Something you got, baby
You gotta to know
My my, whoa whoa
I love you so

Something you got, baby
Makes me feel OK
Something you got, baby
Makes this poor boy wanna stay
Something you got
You gotta to know
My my, whoa whoa
My my, whoa whoa
My my, whoa whoa
I love you so

// Down In The Flood //

Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow
Storm's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row
Well, you can train on down to Williams Point
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

High tide's risin', mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's sugar for sugar and salt for salt
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

Now, don't you try an' move me, you're just gonna lose
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's king for king and queen for queen
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
