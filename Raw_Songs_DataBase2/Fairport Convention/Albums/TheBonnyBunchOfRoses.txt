// The Eynsham Poacher //

Oh, three Eynsham lads came out one day
To Lord Abingdon's manor they made their way
They took some dogs to catch some game
And soon to Wytham woods they came

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

We had not long been beating there
Before our spaniel put up a hare
Up she sprang and away she ran
At the very same time a pheasant sprang

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

We had not beat the woods all through
Before Barrett, the keeper, he came in view
When we saw the old beggar look
We made our way to Cashington brook

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

When we got there 'twas full to the brim
And you'd have laughed to see us swim
Ten feet of water, if not more
When we got out, our dogs came o'er

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

O'er hedges, ditches, gates and rails
Our dogs followed after behind our heels
If you may see, just what you will
He'd 've sent us all to Abingdon jail

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

// The Poor Ditching Boy //

Was there ever a winter so cold and so sad
The river too weary to flood
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I was looking for trouble to tangle my line
But trouble came looking for me
I knew I was standing on treacherous ground
I was sinking too fast to run free

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I would not be asking, I would not be seen
A-beggin on mountain or hill
But I'm ready and blind with my hands tied behind
I've neither a mind nor a will

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

It's bitter the need of the poor ditching boy
He'll always believe what they say
They tell him it's hard to be honest and true
Does he mind if he doesn't get paid?

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

// General Taylor //

General Taylor gained the day
Walk him along, John, carry him along
General Taylor gained the day
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

Carry him to his burying ground
I wish I was sold Stormy's son

Walk him along, John, carry him along
I'd build me a ship of ten thousand ton
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

I'd load her down with ale and rum
Walk him along, John, carry him along
And every shellback should have some
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

We dug his grave with a silver spade
Walk him along, John, carry him along
His shroud of the finest silk was made

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

We lowered him down on a golden chain
Walk him along, John, carry him along
On every link we carved his name
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

General Taylor died long ago
Walk him along, John, carry him along
He's gone to where the winds don't blow
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

// The Last Waltz //

The party's all over, it's time to go
It's time to go
This party's all over, it's time to be gone
It's time to go

The time it is late and I wish we could stay, but
It's time to go
We'll all meet again on some other day
It's time to go

Goodbye to the girls, aye, goodbye to you all
It's time to go
Farewell to the dancing, farewell to the ball
It's time to go

And the door's always open, so come again soon
It's time to go
Let's round off the night with a sprightly tune
It's time to go

So dance to your doorsteps and dance up the stairs
It's time to go
Dance into bed and dance away there
It's time to go

This party's all over, it's time to go
It's time to go
The party's all over, it's time to be gone
It's time to go
