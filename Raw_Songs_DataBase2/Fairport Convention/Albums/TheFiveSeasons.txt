// Claudy Banks //

'Twas on one summer's evening all in the month of May
Down by a flowery garden I carelessly did stray
I overheard a young maid in sorrow to complain
All for her handsome sailor boy who ploughed the raging main

I boldly stepped up to her and put her in surprise
I'll vow she did not know me, I being all in disguise
Says, I'm a charming creature, my joy and heart's delight
How far have you to travel this dark and stormy night?

Away kind sir, to the Claudy Banks if you will please to show
Pity her poor girl distracted, oh, there I have to go
I am in search of a young man and Johnny is his name
Along the banks of Claudy, I'm told he does remain

'Tis six long moths on batter, since your true love left the shore
In passing the wide ocean where French's cannons roar
And crossing the wide ocean with honor and for gain
I'm told his ship was wrecked all on the coast of Spain

On hearing of this dreadful news, it put her in despair
With a wringing of her hands and a tearing of her hair
Oh, since he's gone and left me, no other man I'll take
Oh, on the banks of Claudy I'll wander for his sake

Oh, my heart was filled with joy that night, I could no longer stand
I fell into her arms, crying, "Betsy, I'm that man
I am your faithful young man, whom once you thought was slain
Now, since we've met on Claudy Banks, we'll never part again"

// Rhythm Of The Time //

In and out the seasons, in and out the door
The meadows and the woodland, out across the moor
Bread for the table, fodder for the store
There's a whistle on the breeze in the morning

The men rise early to sharpen up their scythes
Their shirtsleeves rolled and their hats brimmed wide
There's method in their muscle as they move on down the line
There's a whistle on the breeze in the morning

Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the changing time

The line is steady as the mowers make their way
They take a drop of cider in the heat of the day
The harvest is shared in the time-honoured way
There's a whistle on the breeze in the morning

In and out the factory, in and out the mine
The office in the city and the market town
The mowers they are moving in the rhythm of the time
There's a whistle on the breeze in the morning

Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the changing time

Penny for a farthing, penny for a ride
Penny for your thoughts and a penny for the bride
Penny for the poor man who's left high and dry
And a wave and a whistle in the morning

In and out the ages, in and out the years
Love lies a-courting jealousy and fears
There was in the beginning and there will always be
A whistle on the breeze in the morning

Life's a moving picture, we capture it in frames
The image of the perfect and the image of the lame
In the eyes of the mowers we are all the same
There's a whistle on the breeze in the morning

Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the time
Can you feel the rhythm of the changing time

// Ginnie //

Everyone can hear the music
You can taste the mood of the wine
Getting high on the beer and the atmosphere of a good time
You can hear everyone laughing
Like they've got something to share
Cigarette smoke and bad jokes hang in the air

But Ginnie doesn't hear it
I wonder does she realize
She's sitting there with that faraway look in her eyes
Where she goes, she doesn't say
But she'll leave you way behind
Going nowhere, soon, she'll be somewhere else in her mind

But if the music is right
And the rhythm is light
Ginnie will dance the jig tonight

Soon we'll all be singing
The chorus from some old song
Guitars, fiddles, everything playing along
We'll all be hitting the high note
When the piano begins to play
All those songs we hate, but we sing them anyway

But Ginnie doesn't hear it
It's that moment when she goes
Some place in her mind nobody knows
Her laughter's gone, her smile is faded
She loses it all and then
That something forgotten comes back now and again

But if the music is right
And the rhythm is light
Ginnie will dance the jig tonight

There are people talking everywhere
But Ginnie's all alone
She's locked up in that little world of her own
You can look into her eyes
But there's something you won't see
A forgotten moment of some old memory

But if the music is right
And the rhythm is light
Ginnie will dance the jig tonight
Ginnie will dance the jig tonight

// The Wounded Whale //

Low as the sun from her ocean bed was rising
Brought underwater a glittering light rose
Hark from the masthead our lookouts are crying
There's hard on your lee beam a whale there she blows

Call up your sleepers your larboard and your starboard
Men mean yard aback and your boats clear away
For hard on our lee beam see the white water
Green glittering and foaming in glorious array

See the leviathan in vastness is
Lying making the ocean or some chore sped
While high overhead the seabirds are flying
Combing the billows that break o'er her head

High white and swimming her dark fluke sublime
Stately but slowly she sinks in the main
Peak all your oars awhile, rest from your weary toil
Watching and waiting arising again

Row hearties row for the pride of your nation
Spring to your oars let the rigging sweat flow
Now for the blood let a calf circulation
For would on your thwarts you've away all ye know

See how the boats advance gaily as to a dance
Floating like feathers over the dark blue sea
Stand up and give us some. send both your irons home
Stead off and trim your boat, we are all clear

Wounded and sore things and flukes in commotion
Black skin and oars contending spray
While loud long and shrill blows the horn of the ocean
Fretting and lost she brings to in dismay

Haul line every man, gather in all ye can
Lances and spades from yer thwarts clear away
Now clique your oars again, while fast each boat remains
For safely and surely we hold her at bay

Surrounded by foes with strength undiminished
Heed how she flashes her dark flukes in the air
A lance in the life and the struggle is finished
And see how she sinks with a chimney on fire

While so loud and shrill the cry from our seamen
Mocking the whale in her terrible hour
Watch her as she dies see the blue signal flies
Here she goes, fade out, and the contest is o'er
