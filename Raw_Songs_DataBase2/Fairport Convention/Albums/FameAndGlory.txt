// Pilgrims //

Stand up my friend
We're heading out to the western lands
Out towards the sacred isle of Avalon

Come walk with me
Time is short and the road is long
The road that leads to the sacred isle of Avalon

Hold out your hand
I will show you a land full of promise

Remember Finn McCool, Brendan, Bran And Maeldun
They've gone before us to the shores of Avalon

So come take my hand
I will show you a land full of promise

Take heed as you go
There's many danger, fiend and foe
Waiting for us on the road of Avalon

And do not step aside
No matter what temptation lies
In waiting for us on the road of Avalon

Hold out your hand
I will show you a land full of promise

// Marie La Cordelière //

On the tenth' of August 1512
We passed the headland west of Saint-Mathieu
English galleons
50 strong English galleons

And so it was that I did see
The finest ship I'd ever seen
Marie la Cordelière
Belle Marie la Cordelière

She was so fine, such a sight to see
Sailing high on the summer sea
And I am proud to say that I have seen
Belle Marie la Cordelière

And when the Breton captain he did see
The English flags out on the reach, he cried
"Weigh the anchors high and we will fight
Weigh the anchors high!"

And the Belle Marie came sailing proud
200 canons shining on her sides
15 hundred men prepared to die
15 hundred men

Well the battle raged for many'an hour
Till her decks ran red with blood and we breached her side
Then the captain cried "Though we may die
We'll not surrender her"

Across the heaving deck he ran
In each hand a blazing brand he bore
Into the powder store and he blew her high
He fired the powder store

// Duchess Anne //

I swear allegiance, my friend
To your people and your realm
And to your daughter, fair maiden Anne
She is betrothed to my son
When the marriage vows are done
Then our two countries shall be bound as one

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

A thousand soldiers come to the borders of your land
To free your country from the King of France
The devil be this King who would bring us to our knees
For gain, for power and in greed

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

Together we must stand to defy the King of France
Yet again his army marches on your land
With treachery and lies he endeavours
He strives to sow dissension
Our allies to divide

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

War cannot be stayed but with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne shall be saved
