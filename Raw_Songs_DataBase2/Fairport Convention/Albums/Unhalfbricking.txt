Album: Unhalfbricking

// Genesis Hall //

My father he rides with your sheriffs
And I know he would never mean harm
But to see both sides of a quarrel
Is to judge without haste or alarm

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

You take away homes from the homeless
And leave them to die in the cold
The gypsy who begs for your presents
He will laugh in your face when you're old

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

Well one man he drinks up his whiskey
Another he drinks up his wine
And they'll drink till their eyes are red with hate
For those of a different kind

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

When the rivers run thicker than trouble
I'll be there at your side in the flood
T'was all I could do to keep myself
From taking revenge on your blood

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go
Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

// Autopsy //

You must philosophize
But why must you bore me to tears?
You're red around the eyes
You tell me things no one else hears
You spend all your time crying
Crying the hours in tears
Crying the hours in tears

Come lend your time to me
And you will know that you are free
And when you look at me
Don't think you're owning what you see
For remember that you're free
And that's what you want to be
So just lend your time to me

You must philosophize
But why must you bore me to tears?
You're red around the eyes
You tell me things no one else hears
You spend all your time crying
Crying the hours in tears
Crying the hours in to ears

// A Sailor's Life //

A sailor's life, it is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart's delight
Leaving them behind to weep and mourn
They never know when they will return

"Well, there's four and twenty all in a row
My true love he makes the finest show
He's proper, tall, genteel withal
And if I don't have him, I'll have none at all"
"Oh, father build for me a bonny boat
That on the wide ocean I may float
And every Queen's ship that we pass by
There I'll inquire for my sailor boy"

They had not sailed long upon the deep
When a Queen's ship they chanced to meet
"You sailors all, pray tell me true
Does my sweet William sail among your crew?"

"Oh no, fair maiden, he is not here
For he's been drownded, we greatly fear
On yon green island, as we passed it by
There we lost sight of your sailing boy"

Well, she rung her hands and she tore her hair
She was like a young girl in great despair
And her little boat against a rock did run
"How can I live now? My sweet William is gone"

// Cajun Woman //

The baby that the preacher gave you in the Spring
Spent the winter with his finger in the undertaker's ring

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

He grew up in the bayou with a bible 'round his neck
He never loved a woman in the way you would expect

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

Don't tell him 'bout his Father, don't tell him 'bout his name
The Gods won't get to Heaven if you crucify his brain

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

Well it's welcome to the graveyard and welcome to the throne
Welcome to the orphanage where your family sit and moan
Welcome to the liquor store and welcome to the poor
Your momma never told you how lucky you are

Oh Cajun woman, some people still call you a queen
I don't believe you're sinking but look at all the trouble you've been

// Percy's Song //

Bad news, bad news
Come to me where I sleep
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin' one of your friends
Is in trouble deep
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Tell me the trouble
Tell me once to my ear
Turn, turn, turn again
Joliet prison
And ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Oh what's the charge
Of how this came to be
Turn, turn, turn again
Manslaughter
In the highest of degree
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

I sat down and wrote
The best words I could write
Turn, turn, turn again
Explaining to the judge
I'd be there on Wednesday night
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Without a reply
I left by the moon
Turn, turn, turn again
And was in his chambers
By the next afternoon
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Could you tell me the facts?
I said without fear
Turn, turn, turn again
That a friend of mine
Should get ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

A crash on the highway
Flew the car to a field
Turn, turn, turn again
There were four persons killed
And he was at the wheel
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

That may be true
He's got a sentence to serve
Turn, turn, turn again
But ninety-nine years
He just don't deserve
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

And at that the judge jerked forward
And his face it did freeze
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin', "Could you kindly leave
My office now, please"
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Well his eyes looked funny
And I stood up so slow
Turn, turn, turn again
With no other choice
Except for to go
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

I walked down the hallway
And I heard his door slam
Turn, turn, turn again
I walked down the courthouse stairs
And I did not understand
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

And I played my guitar
Through the night to the day
Turn, turn, turn again
And the only tune
My guitar could play
Was, "The old Cruel Rain
And the Wind"

// Million Dollar Bash //

Well, that big dumb blonde with Gorgeous George
And Turtle, a friend of theirs, with his cheques all forged
And his cheeks in a trunk with a cheese in the cash
You're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash, and it's

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Everybody from right now go over there and back
The louder they come, well the bigger they crack
Come now, sweet [?] and don't forget the flash
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I took my counsellor out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn
Then along came Jones and emptied the trash
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I been hittin' it too hard, you know, my [?] won't take
I get up in the morning, bit too early to wake
First it's "Hello", then "Goodbye", they push and they crash
But everybody's gonna make it to that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I looked at my watch then I looked at my wrists
Punched myself in my face with my fists and I
Took my taters back a-home to be mashed
But then I made it right on to that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

// Dear Landlord //

Dear landlord
Please don't put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I'm gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you've suffered much
But in this you are not so unique

Each of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone who fills his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don't dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue
I'm not about to move to no other place
Each of us, he has his own special gifts
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don't underestimate me
I won't underestimate you

// The Ballad Of Easy Rider //

The river flows, flows to the sea
Wherever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town

All he wanted was just to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow, river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town

Flow river go, past the shady tree
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
Flow river flow, flow to the sea

The river flows to the sea
Wherever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town

All he wanted was just to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow, river flow, let your waters rush down
Take me from this road to some other town

Flow river go, past the shady tree
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
