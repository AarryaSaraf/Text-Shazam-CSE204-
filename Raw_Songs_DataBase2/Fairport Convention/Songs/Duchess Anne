I swear allegiance, my friend
To your people and your realm
And to your daughter, fair maiden Anne
She is betrothed to my son
When the marriage vows are done
Then our two countries shall be bound as one

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

A thousand soldiers come to the borders of your land
To free your country from the King of France
The devil be this King who would bring us to our knees
For gain, for power and in greed

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

Together we must stand to defy the King of France
Yet again his army marches on your land
With treachery and lies he endeavours
He strives to sow dissension
Our allies to divide

Duchess Anne with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne will be saved
Do not fear, the battle shall be won
We will fight them, we will crush them to the ground

War cannot be stayed but with courage and with faith in God
La Bretagne shall be saved
