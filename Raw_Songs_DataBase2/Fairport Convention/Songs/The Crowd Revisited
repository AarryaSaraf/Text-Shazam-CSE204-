The sea reflects the universe, all the planets, stars and moon
A puddle holds these things as well, if I'm here then so are you
Look into your neighbour's eyes and within you'll see the crowd
Everyone in everything, you are happy, you are loud

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

Now wrap me up in voices that are always in my heart
And though I will be gone from here, we will never be apart

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you
The crowd will always be with you
The crowd will always be with you
