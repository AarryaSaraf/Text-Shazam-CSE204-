Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window and the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day and we'll wear it 'til the night comes

Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains and a rainbow on my wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal peaks to beckon
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day, there's a side-show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passers-by
And pictures fly and papers lie
Just waiting to blow away

Woke up big this Chelsea morning and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges too
And the light poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh won't you stay? We'll put on a day and we'll talk in present tenses

Now the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I'll bring you incense owls by night
By candle-light, by jewel-light
If only you will stay

Pretty baby won't you wake up, it's the Chelsea morning
