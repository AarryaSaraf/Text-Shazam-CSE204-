Something you got, baby
Makes me work all day
Something you got, baby
Makes me bring home my pay
Something you got, baby
You gotta to know
My my, whoa whoa
I love you so

Something you got, baby
Makes me stay home at night
Something you got, baby
Makes me feel alright
Something you got, baby
You gotta to know
My my, whoa whoa
I love you so

Something you got, baby
Makes me feel OK
Something you got, baby
Makes this poor boy wanna stay
Something you got
You gotta to know
My my, whoa whoa
My my, whoa whoa
My my, whoa whoa
I love you so
