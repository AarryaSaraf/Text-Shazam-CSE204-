There's no excuse for torture, that you ought to know
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Yonder stands a scarecrow, he's hollow in his robes
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
The song was only in our time
They'll call it long, long ago
They'll say, "Ah well, it was their best"
Let it go, let it go
The master and the mistress a-trying hard to show
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Now there is not time for shame or tears on a window pane
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
Eyes were made to smile and water
Tears were made to flow
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
There's a game that would have bought you
Were you ever set to throw
Let it live, let it breathe, let it go
