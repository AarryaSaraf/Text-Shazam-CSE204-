Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

He's standing on the edge
Looking out across the flow
He puts his feet up to the wire
To feel the tension with his toe

Now he knows the time is right
A final dust of chalk on hand
A certain dryness in his mouth
Everything is how he planned

A hush goes round the watching crowd
They hold their breath beneath the mist
A pair of eyes look to his face
A gasp from lips that he's just kissed

She hoped that he would change the ways
She prays that God is on his side
A glance to heaven for a sign
She knows this water is so wide

I have to walk a similar line
Across this twisted breed of love
With every step I fear I'll fall
No one to catch me from above
So hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire

The roaring canyon calls him on
The pole now held across his chest
While rainbows play across the sun
He puts his muscle to the test

He edges out into the void
Cameras click to catch the sight
No going back, just straight ahead
Between the darkness and the light

Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

Hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire

As if a diamond held his gaze
Above Niagara's loudest roar
Treading softly with his soul now
To reach where he's not been before

Now he's standing on the edge
Looking back across the flow
Seems like he's walked a million miles

I have to walk a similar line
Across this twisted breed of love
With every step I fear I'll fall
No one to catch me from above
So hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire
You are my balance on the wire
You are my balance on the wire
