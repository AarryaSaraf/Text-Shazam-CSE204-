Now I've been an engine driver all of my days
That's the only thing I can do
I hold a good head of steam everywhere that I'm seen
Wherever my wheels rolled through
Wherever my wheels rolled through

Well, I was nearly shut down in a Midwest town
Her hair was red, her eyes were blue
But the wheels on the track kept calling me back
So I bid that girl adieu
Yes, I bid that girl adieu

Blow whistle, steel wheels keep on humming
Hold on darling your engine driver's coming
He's coming through

Some day I'll have to give up the iron line
And then I'll know just what I will find
I'll find me some shack by some old railroad track
So I can hear them motors whine
So I can hear them motors whine

Blow whistle, hear them steel rails humming
Hold on darling your engineer is coming
He's coming through

Now I've been an engine driver all of my days
That's the only thing I can do
I hold a good head of steam anywhere that I'm seen
Anywhere my trains rolled through
Anywhere my trains rolled through

Blow whistle, hear that steel rail humming
Hold on girl your engine driver's coming
Coming to you
