It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the change in your pocket is beginning to grumble
And you reap just about what you've sown
You can walk down the street, pass your face in the window
You can go on fooling around
You can work night and day, take a chance on promotion
You can fall through a hole in the ground

Well there ain't no game like the game that you're playing
When you got a little something to lose
And there ain't no time, like the time you been wasting
And you waste just about what you choose
There's a man at the table and you know he's been able
To return all the odds that you lay
But you can't feed your hunger and you ain't getting younger
Your tongue ain't got nothing to say

It's a long, long way down to Reno, Nevada
It's a long, long way to your home
And the ground underneath you is beginning to crumble
And the sky up above you has grown
There's a time to be grieving and a time to be screaming
And a time just to stroll the wall
But you ain't got the double, and it ain't worth the trouble
Your feet are going nowhere at all
