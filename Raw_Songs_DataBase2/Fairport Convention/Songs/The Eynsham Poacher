Oh, three Eynsham lads came out one day
To Lord Abingdon's manor they made their way
They took some dogs to catch some game
And soon to Wytham woods they came

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

We had not long been beating there
Before our spaniel put up a hare
Up she sprang and away she ran
At the very same time a pheasant sprang

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

We had not beat the woods all through
Before Barrett, the keeper, he came in view
When we saw the old beggar look
We made our way to Cashington brook

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

When we got there 'twas full to the brim
And you'd have laughed to see us swim
Ten feet of water, if not more
When we got out, our dogs came o'er

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

O'er hedges, ditches, gates and rails
Our dogs followed after behind our heels
If you may see, just what you will
He'd 've sent us all to Abingdon jail

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go

Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
Laddie-i-o, laddie-i-o, three jolly young fellows as ever did go
