Oh, ye mariners all, as you pass by
Call in and drink if you are dry
Come spend, my lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this

Oh, ye mariners all, if you've half a crown
You're welcome all for to sit down
Come spend, my lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this

Oh, ye gentlemen all, as you pass by
Call in and drink if you are dry
Call in and drink, think naught amiss
And pop your nose in a jug of this

And now I'm old and can scarcely drawl
Have an old grey beard and a head that's bald
Fell my desire, fulfill my bliss
A pretty girl and a jug of this

Oh, when I'm in my grave and dead
And all my sorrows are past and fled
Transform me then into a fish
And let me swim in a jug of this

Oh, ye mariners all, as you pass by
Call in and drink if you are dry
Come spend, my lads, your money brisk
And pop your nose in a jug of this
