Standing here, holding an empty cup
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an inch, but you needed that extra look
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an apple, sit from the tree
You can set me up
You have set me up

Just one bite, straight into ecstasy
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

On the front page, a mother she was crying
You can set me up
You have set me up

To the children she knew she was denying
You can set me up
You have set me up

Next to her, leaning on her shoulder
You can set me up
You have set me up

Crazy man, paid a price for what he told her
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

Cased in gold, a future I can see
You can set me up
You have set me up

Fix my eyes are nothing but a memory
You can set me up
You have set me up

Open the door there was just an empty space
You can set me up
You have set me up

What I shot at, I could only see your face
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

Standing here, holding an empty cup
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an inch, but you needed that extra look
You can set me up
You have set me up
