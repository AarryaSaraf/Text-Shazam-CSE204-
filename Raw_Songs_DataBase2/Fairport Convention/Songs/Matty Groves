A holiday, a holiday, and the first one of the year
Lord Darnell's wife came into church, the gospel for to hear

And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd

"Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light"

"Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are Lord Darnell's wife"

"What if I am Lord Darnell's wife? Lord Darnell's not at home
For he is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home"

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said
He swore Lord Darnell he would know before the sun would set

And in his hurry to carry the news he bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad mill stream he took of his shoes and he swam

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep
When he awoke, Lord Darnell was standing at his feet

Saying "How do you like my feather bed? And how do you like my sheets?
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?"

"Oh, well I like your feather bed, and well I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep"

"Well, Get up, get up", Lord Darnell cried "Get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man"

"Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket-knife"

"Well it's true I have two beaten swords, and they cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse"

"And you will strike the very first blow, and strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Darnell sore
Lord Darnell struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more

And then Lord Darnell he took his wife and he sat her on his knee
Saying, "Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?"

And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free
"I'd rather kiss from dead Matty's lips, than you with your finery

Lord Darnell he jumped up and loudly he did bawl
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall

"A grave, a grave!" Lord Darnell cried, "to put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top for she was of noble kin"
