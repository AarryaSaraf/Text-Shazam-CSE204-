The lazy hazy day is picking up the heat
On ripening fields of maize, hot earth beneath my feet
Guess I'll hit the road to find you
Let luck decide who gives the ride

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar

The verge is full of flowers that come up year on year
Sunshine into showers, still no one's passing here
I need someone to remind me
Of water good, my memory's blurred

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar

The sailor and the song, the danger and bravado
Of how he carried on when the loneliness had found him
Throwing dice for the direction
Of the breeze, through random seas

Oh, heaven help the soul that never finds its home
Forever in a hole, always far too wrong
Now the headlights blind my eyes
Redeeming light, into the night

So many things to say to you
Of love and life and who we are

So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
So I'll sing a song for you
On Rui's guitar
