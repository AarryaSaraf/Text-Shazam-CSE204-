Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Feels like a break-up, you're taking up time

Don't say you told her,  still you love her
Oh, that's where you've been, I hadn't seen all the signs
You swear you've changed then you tell me again
That it's you I can trust, for you must think that I'm blind
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Stop all the schooling, just keep it cool and
Believe what I say though it may seem unkind
Too late for pleading, (I just want some peace)
And go find a new friend 'cause it's the end of the line
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time

Don't say you caught me, if you don't need me
Then I'll walk away, come on make up your mind
Don't try to use me or cry to confuse me 'cause
I know your games and they're the same games as mine
Why don't you wake up? You're taking up time
