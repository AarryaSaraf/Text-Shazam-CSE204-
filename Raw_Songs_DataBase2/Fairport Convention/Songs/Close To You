Ships are sailing, looks like rain out on the Island
On the rushing wind I taste the salt upon my tongue
Waves meet and fall as one against the headland
The kind of day that makes me wish that you had come

And fishing boats head out in the driving rain
Up against the swell they seem insane
And you know they'll put to sea again and again
I want to be close to you

Back on dry land people hurry about their business
Here the clock hands slowly come around
I turn my way to the top of this sultry fortress
To light the way so others won't come aground

And you know your smile is in this light
That l will send into the night
It doesn't seem to matter now just who was wrong
As I write these words to you

Ships pass, tall masts, out in the sound
Dark night, no moonlight, we've run aground

And love makes, love breaks
There's no solid ground
How my heart aches, as this lamplight
It goes round and round and round

Lonely seabird, do you have a wish to fly
Out across the decks of the unknown
There'll be nameless people trading out across the ocean
Hoping to return to hearts and their homes

While all around me now the tide has turned
I can only say what I hare learned
Another storm has come and gone but I stood firm
I want to be close to you

All around me now the tide has turned
I can only say what I have learned
Another storm has come and gone but I stood firm
I want to be close to you
