Stand up my friend
We're heading out to the western lands
Out towards the sacred isle of Avalon

Come walk with me
Time is short and the road is long
The road that leads to the sacred isle of Avalon

Hold out your hand
I will show you a land full of promise

Remember Finn McCool, Brendan, Bran And Maeldun
They've gone before us to the shores of Avalon

So come take my hand
I will show you a land full of promise

Take heed as you go
There's many danger, fiend and foe
Waiting for us on the road of Avalon

And do not step aside
No matter what temptation lies
In waiting for us on the road of Avalon

Hold out your hand
I will show you a land full of promise
