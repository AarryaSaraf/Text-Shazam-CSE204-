Low as the sun from her ocean bed was rising
Brought underwater a glittering light rose
Hark from the masthead our lookouts are crying
There's hard on your lee beam a whale there she blows

Call up your sleepers your larboard and your starboard
Men mean yard aback and your boats clear away
For hard on our lee beam see the white water
Green glittering and foaming in glorious array

See the leviathan in vastness is
Lying making the ocean or some chore sped
While high overhead the seabirds are flying
Combing the billows that break o'er her head

High white and swimming her dark fluke sublime
Stately but slowly she sinks in the main
Peak all your oars awhile, rest from your weary toil
Watching and waiting arising again

Row hearties row for the pride of your nation
Spring to your oars let the rigging sweat flow
Now for the blood let a calf circulation
For would on your thwarts you've away all ye know

See how the boats advance gaily as to a dance
Floating like feathers over the dark blue sea
Stand up and give us some. send both your irons home
Stead off and trim your boat, we are all clear

Wounded and sore things and flukes in commotion
Black skin and oars contending spray
While loud long and shrill blows the horn of the ocean
Fretting and lost she brings to in dismay

Haul line every man, gather in all ye can
Lances and spades from yer thwarts clear away
Now clique your oars again, while fast each boat remains
For safely and surely we hold her at bay

Surrounded by foes with strength undiminished
Heed how she flashes her dark flukes in the air
A lance in the life and the struggle is finished
And see how she sinks with a chimney on fire

While so loud and shrill the cry from our seamen
Mocking the whale in her terrible hour
Watch her as she dies see the blue signal flies
Here she goes, fade out, and the contest is o'er
