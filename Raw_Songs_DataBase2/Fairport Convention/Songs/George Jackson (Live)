I woke up this mornin', there were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved, shot him the head
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sent him off to prison for a seventy-dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him and threw away the key
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

He wouldn't take shit from no one, he wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him because he was just too real
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Prison guards, they hitted him as they cursed him from above
But they were frightened of his power, they were scared of his love
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Sometimes I think this whole world is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners, the rest of us are guards
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground

Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, they laid him in the ground
