His father was a dancer before him
And his father before him, and his father before him
Moving in line with the steps that came down through the years

Like a spell through the streets
Everyone had their stories and family glories
Ribbons swayed in the air of a new summer breeze

It's in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone

Fiddles played with such joy
It's hard to remember, so hard to remember
When feet felt so light they couldn't keep still
They said farewell to each spot with a Bonny Green Garter

Joking and laughter
This age-old round carried on
In tune with the year

It's in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone

The silver watch carried near his breast would have so impressed
Many younger men who were dancing then
Never missing out a day at school, he was no-one's fool
And every now and then he'd sing a song for friends

Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking

When the day's end is near the streets start to clear
At the end of the beer
His thoughts take him back to the old dancing days
His father a dancer before him and his father before him
And his father before him
Kept alive all those steps
And the tunes that they played

'Cause its in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
Lt was written in the stone
It was written in the stone
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone
