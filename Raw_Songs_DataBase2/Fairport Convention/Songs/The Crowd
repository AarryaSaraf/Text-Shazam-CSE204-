You walk into this field of green and you sit upon the ground
You watch the pleasant world go by and you listen to the sound
The sound of people singing and the sound of all their cheers
The sound of each and everyone, you come together here
Now lay aside your sadnesses and throw your troubles down
Live just for this fine moment, pick it up and pass it 'round

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

The sea reflects the universe, all the planets, stars and moon
A puddle holds these things as well, if I'm here then so are you
For look into your neighbour's eyes and within you'll see the crowd
Everyone in everything, you are happy, you are loud

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

Stand up, stand up and follow me, sing the loudest you'll ever hear
And hold this in your memory and draw your loved ones near
Now wrap me up in voices that are always in my heart
And though I will be gone from here, we will never be apart

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you

And it makes no difference who you are
It makes no difference what you do
And it makes no difference where you go
The crowd will always be with you
Crowd will always be with you
Crowd will always be with you
