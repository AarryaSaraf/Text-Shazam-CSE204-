There's a lady who carries a burden
And the lines on her face tell it all
She remembers hearing sad stories
But still dances at Memory Hall

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon

Once a young girl, with rings on her fingers
Given to her by a boy she once loved
Barefoot, they sat by the river
Sharing secrets with god up above

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon

On a cold night by the roadside she rested
Pale was her skin, tired and worn
Her beauty had faded through grieving
She was too tired to weep, too tired to mourn

And the stars would come out just to see her
And the clouds blew away all too soon
Her face lit the heavens above her
She was helped by the Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
Celtic Moon
