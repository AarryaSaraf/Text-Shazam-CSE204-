London Danny, you're a real bad penny
You're the one man that time has taught me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said that she'll be mine
So why'd you have to come and show your face round here?

'Cos she always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

Well I've learned to listen for your name round town
When people talk of your success in city life
And I can never tell if she hears them talk as well
And rues the day she ever was a poor man's wife

And we always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Oh now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

Well my hands are black while yours are clean and clever
And there's ways you know to turn her pretty head
And it's all that I can do when my working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep at night in bed

And we always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Oh now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

London Danny, you're a real bad penny
You're the one man that time has taught me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said that she'll be mine
So why'd you have to come and show your face round here?

'Cos she always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny
