She's laying in bed with a pillow to her head and the red tide rising
It came out of nowhere this morning like a red tide
And yesterday it hadn't started - big plans, big plans
She's caught between the blue of the ocean and the red of the red tide

And I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide

He's out in the bar and he's going too far with the red tide rising
Her face is a shadow and her open mouth is like a red tide
Tonight was gonna be so perfect - big plans, big plans
There's no holds barred in the back of the car 'cos this is the red tide

I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide

It's dark on the stair when there's nobody there but the red tide rising
The cloth that they covered his body with was like a red tide
And all the years they were together - big plans, big plans
No farewells, no parting laughs, just the red tide

And I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide
