Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Finished our food and got into the wagon
To drive 80 miles and then do the show
5 hours later, we're still busy trucking
Banging and bumping; don't know where to go

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Got to the gig, although nobody else did
Set up the gear and began to play
Farmers and soldiers just standing and staring
Just didn't know what to make of the day

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Finished the last song and made for the exit
But the manager man had come up from the sticks
He said "why ain't you dressed like a poofter ensemble
Leaping pianos and waving your legs?"
Dear Mr Hilter, we've been meaning to tell you
It's really quite simple, you don't have to fear
We ain't your Rolling Stones, we ain't your T-Rex
Actually we're only here for the beer

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine

Into the van again, out on the highway
Back to our hotel to take a rest
Everyone's swigging their Egri Bikaver
Things really were funny in old Budapest

Oh what a time we had down by the Danube!
Eating our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
Listening to Gypsy bands playing cimbaloms
Everyone's happy and things are just fine
Oh what a time we had down by the Danube
Drinking our Ghoulash and drinking our wine
I've fucked it up!
