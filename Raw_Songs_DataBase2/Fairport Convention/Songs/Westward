I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

They promised you silver, they promised you gold
Not one word of truth in the lies that they told

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

I'm going home where the air is cleaner
And a word's as good as true
And I'm going home where the grass is greener
And a heart has a purpose too

I've set my heart on that acre of land
With all of that good life ahead of me planned
I'll be counting my money and counting the days
'Til I've got the ticket to take me away

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward
I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned
I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned

I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned
