How happy's that man that's free from all care
He loves to make merry, he loves to make merry
With a drop of good beer

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

How happy's that man who's free from all strife
He envies no other, he envies no other
But travels through life

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

Our seaman of gold, they fear not their foes
They throw away discord, they throw away discord
And to mirth they're inclined

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year

How happy's that man that's free from all care
He loves to make merry, he loves to make merry
With a drop of good beer

With his pipe and his friends puffing hours away
Singing song after song till he hails the new day
He can laugh, dance and sing and smoke without fear
Be as happy as a king till he hails a new year
