I come from the moor and the mountain, from the waterfall and stream
I've turned my back on the mountain track; I'm walking in a dream
And every new horizon to me it seems the same
And everywhere looks old and bare while trav'ling on the plains

There's no one rides this road with me, a plainsman rides alone
The welcome waits by a city gate, no voice to call me home
Alone I came into this place, and that is how I will go
And all I learn is the season's turn, that's all I need to know

Oh the world is hung with silver tongues with good advice to give
If you can't show me how to die, don't tell me how to live
The plainsman's song, though it's seldom long, it's more than meets the ear
And all I believe is the falling leaves at the turning of the year
