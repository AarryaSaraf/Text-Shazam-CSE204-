Well, there's certain things
That I learned from Jim
He'd always make sure I'd understand
That there is a certain way
That we all must swim
If we expect to live off
Of the fat of the land

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

There's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A man who never even blushes
That we must expect to always flush out our house
If we don't want goin' 'round housing flushes

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
And I ain't gonna hear it said no more

"Take care of all your memories"
Said Mick
"For you cannot relive them
Remember that when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them"

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
And I ain't gonna hear it said no more
