Ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew about your plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before?
Between the two of us guys, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say, when I found out yesterday

I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

You know that a man ain't supposed to cry, but these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see, 'cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself that I found out from someone else

Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah

People say, "Believe half of what you see, son, and none of what you hear"
But I can't help bein' confused; if it's true, please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go for that other guy that you knew before?

Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be mine
Ooh, I heard it through the grapevine, and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah
