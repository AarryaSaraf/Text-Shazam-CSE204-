My young love said to me
"My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind"

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
"Oh, it will not be long, love
Till our wedding day"

And she went away from me
And moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her
Move here and move there

And then she went onward
Just one star awake
Like the swan in the evening
Moves over the lake

Last night she came to me
My dead love came in
So softly she came
That her feet made no din

And she laid her hand on me
And this she did say
"Oh, it will not be long, love
Till our wedding day"
