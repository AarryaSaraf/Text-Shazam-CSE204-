Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
Because I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone really gone
Gone, gone, gone, 'cause you done me wrong

Everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
Why you're on your own
Just tell 'em I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, 'cause you done me wrong

If you change your way, baby
You might get me to stay, baby
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone
'Cause I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong
