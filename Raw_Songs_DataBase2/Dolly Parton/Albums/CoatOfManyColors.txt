// If I Lose My Mind //

Mama, it's so good to be back home again
I'm so proud to see that you are looking well
Yes, I know that I look a little weary
Oh, but Mama, I have been through living hell
You know how much I've always loved him, Mama
But he done things to me I couldn't understand
Why, he made me watch him love another woman
And he tried to make me love another man

Mama, can I be your little girl again?
I need you now even more than I did then
And I need a lot of love and understanding
And a lot of time to get me over him

If I lose my mind, Mama, I wanna be here with you
Have them lock me up and see I have good care
But I just couldn't stand his torture any longer
I was afraid of what I'd do if I stayed there

// The Mystery Of The Mystery //

There are so many things that I don't understand
And I search my mind to try to find an answer
But the more I search the less I seem to find out why
Like where where the wind goes, how does life begin
What happens when we die
The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown
Only God can know and man must not see
Great minds have tried but they will not find
The answer to the mystery of the mystery

Man will seek the mystic rails of the mystery
But their silent halls reveal not a sound
Many men will give their lives just to try to find
The answer to a mystery in their mind

The mystery of the mystery must stay unknown
Only God can know and man must not see
Great minds have tried but they will not find
The answer to the mystery of the mystery

// She Never Met A Man (She Didn't Like) //

I know you think you love her and you're making plans to leave
But I must tell you something I just hope you'll believe
I know it isn't real love that you see in her eyes
Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
And you're no different from the others
A new acquaintence in the night
You mean no more to her than all the others she's held tight
But I know she's convinced you it was love at first sight
But she's never met a man she didn't like

I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For there'll be other men and she won't want you then
She's never met a man she didn't like

I must let you go but I want you to know
That I love you please don't let her ruin our lives
For she'll have other men oh and she won't want you then
Cause she's never met a man she didn't like
Oh no she's never met a man she didn't like

// The Way I See You //

You're gentle body lying here so close to me
As you move your hand slowly across my face
You're touch is as soft as the words you speak to me
What a love in the way I see you
I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
Like the love in the way I see you

I compare it with the beauty of the dawning
Or when the sun sets and paints its picture in the blue
Like a butterfly that has a million colors, all such beauty
What a love in the way I see you

// A Better Place To Live //

There's a bit of magic in a simple little smile
Something that just makes life seem a little more worthwhile
And there's a world of meaning in the touch of someone's hand
A gentle touch that let's your brother know you understand
Oh if people would stop taking and just once try to give
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
La la la la la la la la la la la la

And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me

La la la la la la la la la la la la

All life has to offer that's what most folks desire
But offer nothing in return, cause they don't seem to care
And if we'd ask to be forgiven and be willing to forgive
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live
And if we'd all climb together, we could climb the highest hill
We could make the world we're living in a better place to live

And if we'd love one another instead of finding faults
We could afford the price of peace, love is all it costs
Oh wouldn't it be great to live and sing in harmony
Everybody take your brother's hand and sing my song with me

La la la la la la la la la la la la

// Just As Good As Gone //

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

I stand here in the doorway of the room where you lie sleeping
In hopes that I don't wake you up with the sounds of my weeping, mmmhmm
It breaks my heart to see you lying there, alone in the bed we used to share
'Cause you no longer want me and I wonder what went wrong

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

There's so much more between us than just these lonely walls
The echoes of our dying love lingers in the halls, mmmhmm
Living separately together in a house that's not a home

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

Through the eyes of a broken heart, I watch my whole world fall apart
I'm trying to revive a love that's died
Hopelessly I'm holding on to a love I know is gone
Gone, but not because I haven't tried
Disappearing from your door way now the hurt is twice as strong

Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone
Though you haven't left me yet, I know you're just as good as gone

// The Tender Touch Of Love //

I've felt the sturdy hand of fate upon me
And I've felt the stings of love's burning pain
And I've felt the happiness of those around me
But I've never felt the touch of love's sweet hand

The tender touch of love and understanding
That makes your body trembling with true love
They say oh that words could not describe it
Oh but I've never felt the tender touch of love

Though I've felt needy hands say "I love you"
But when the need is gone, they turn away
And leave my heart with emptiness inside it
The hands of hurting touch the empty place

I've never felt the touch of understanding
That makes your body tremble with true love
They say [?] could not describe it
But I've never felt the tender touch of love

Oh no I've never felt the tender touch of love
