Album: JustTheTwoOfUs

// Closer By The Hour //

You're the sweetest one I know
And I just can't let you go
I just dream of holding you inside my arms

I go home each night to stay
But I just can't stay away
And we get closer, closer by the hour

We get closer by the hour
Though we tried with all our power
To stay away from each other's arms
We get closer by the hour
Like the bee goes to the flower
Closer, closer by the hour

We come closer with each kiss
And I feel your lips insist
That I do your will and love you more and more

Although we know it's wrong
We can't stay where we belong
And We get closer, closer by the hour

We get closer by the hour
Though we tried with all our power
To stay away from each other's arms
We get closer by the hour
Like the bee goes to the flower
Closer, closer by the hour

// I Washed My Face In The Morning Dew //

The first strange town I was ever in the county was hangin' a man
And nobody cared if he lived or he died and I just didn't understand

So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along

The second strange town I was in they were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street and I just didn't understand

So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along

The third strange town that I was in was settled peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer and to me it didn't seem right

So I washed my face in the morning dew bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew and kept on moving along

Now someday times are bound to change it can't be very far
And each injustice that I have seen will come before the bar

Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew and my journey will be done

// Holding On To Nothin' //

We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto

I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through

We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold onto
Lets be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long how hard we've tried

Oh, why do we keep holding on with nothing left to hold onto
Lets be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto

// Slip Away Today //

You jark back your hand away from mine
And I move my lips away from yours
Then quietly we sit trying to forget
Those deep running thoughts that run wild across our minds

You quickly stop the words you start to say
And we realize just how close we are
And we both know if we let ourselves go
We'll do something we'll be sorry for

Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
It's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
Trying to hold back emotions and desires
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for

My love hungry heart begs for more
Of what your lips hold in store
But our conscience just won't let us at least tonight it kept us
From jumping off the deep end and going too far

But one of these nights you and I
Will be ruled by the passion of our hearts
And we both know that we let ourselves go
And do something that we'll be sorry for

Slip away today means sorrow tomorrow
It's love we know but we can't keep but yet we like to borrow
Trying to hold back emotions and desires
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for
It's hard to keep from doing something we'll be sorry for

// The Dark End Of The Street //

At the dark end of the street, that's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street, you and me

I know that time's gonna take its toll, we have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong, oh, but our love keeps a coming on strong
Steal away to the dark end of the street, you and me

They're gonna find us, yes, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us, Lord, some day
You and me at the dark end of the street, you and me

And when the daylight hours roll 'round, and by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet, you just walk on by, oh, my darling, now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street, you and me

// Just The Two Of Us //

No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough

If there were just the two of us how different things would be
No one could come between us from now on
The wagging tongues would speak no more the sounds of gossip gone
Without a prying ear to fall upon

No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us

Though clouds of doubt may drift about upon a stormy sea
I'll only draw you nearer onto me
As long as we're together we'll never walk alone
We'll build a world of sunshine of our own

No we can't control the evil that surround us
But as long as we're together that's enough
Though we have no power over those around us
We can act as if there's just the two of us

// Afraid To Love Again //

If every time that you got hurt it left a scar
And if every dream you ever had broke your heart
If every time you made a plan the world came to an end
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If broken dreams are all it seems you've ever known
And hurt's the only thing you can depend upon
And if you should find misery to be your only friend
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

If every time you look up a cloud should hide the sun
Pay dearly for each kindness ever shown to anyone
If everything you try should fail before you can begin
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again
Then you'd know why I'm afraid to love again

// We'll Get Ahead Someday //

We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday

Well I get up early an' work hard all day
Listen to the troubles of my friends
But I don't realize 'til I get home
What an awful shape we're in

The car's wore out
The kids need shoes
Got a bill from the doctor today
The landlord said you'll get out tomorrow
If you don't get me some pay

We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday

The paper says there's a sale downtown
I gotta have some money today
Well there's things at home
That ain't never been used
You bought last bargain day

Well you go out on Saturday night
You spend too much money on wine
Well I work hard all week long
And I gotta have a little fun sometimes

We'll get ahead someday
We'll get ahead someday
If the sun comes up
And we both cut down
We'll get ahead someday

// Somewhere Between //

I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again

Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you

// The Party //

As we were dressing to go out our little girl and boy
Came in and asked if they could go this time
We told them little girls and boys don't belong at parties
And that they should be in bed asleep by nine

The babysitter came in then and we kissed the kids goodbye
And told them that we'd be home soon and told them not to cry

Then we left for the party like we'd so often done
Thinkin' only of ourselves and not our little ones
The party started out wild and it grew wilder as the night wore on
With drinking, laughing, telling dirty jokes, nobody thinkin' of home
Then the stranger feeling came over me and it chilled me to the bones
And I told my wife that we'd better leave the party
'Cause I felt that we were needed at home
As we rode along I got to thinking of how the kids that mornin'
Had asked if we would take them to church the next day
And how I'd put 'em off like I'd so often done
By sayin' we'd probably get home too late
Then my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of sirens
As they cut through the still night air
Then we turned down our street that's when we saw the fire
The rest was like a nightmare
We took their little bodies to church the next day
Though we'd left the party early we still got home too late

// I Can //

I can lose myself in the beauty of a song
I can climb to the top of a cloud in the sky
I can soar through the heavens like a graceful eagle
I can swing from the wings of a butterfly

I can chase the wind down the canyons of my mind
I can catch it in the corner of my memory
I can make it breathe a breath of life into an old love that has died
And I can stand and reminisce a while

In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you

I can take a journey to the end of the rainbow
I can go there and back and never leave my room
I can change a heartache into a tiny snowflake
And I can take December and turn it into June

In my mind I can be anything I want to be
In my mind I can do anything I want to do
Except make my mind forget you
