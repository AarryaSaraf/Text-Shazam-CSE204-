// Dumb Blonde //

Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
Its stormy wheater an' had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

When you left you thought I'd sit
An' you thought I'd wait
An' you thought I'd cry
You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
Its stormy wheater an' had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool

// Here I Am //

Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a love that's true
Need someone to stand by you
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am

Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been searching for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am

My world is such an empty place
I need someone to fill the space
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Because I've got so much love to give
I need someone to share it with
And here I am (here I am)
Oh here I am, here I am
Oh

Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been searching for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am
Oh here I am,
Here I am

Oh here I am
Oh here I am,
Here I am
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am, yeah
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am, hmmm
