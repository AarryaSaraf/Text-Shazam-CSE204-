The road of love is steep it's a hard climb all the way
To stay in love we must keep working at it every day
We have our ups and downs but we take it with a grin
'Cause we've promised to stick together through thick and thin

We don't always see eye to eye and we don't always agree
But every day we both try to make each other happy
And if we have a quarrel we'll just kiss and try again
'Cause we've promised to stick together through thick and thin

We've promised to stick together that's what we're gonna do
We won't let our love grow old we're gonna keep it new
Hard times may hit us maybe just around the bend
But we've promised to stick together through thick and thin
