Oh I wish I was a kissin' tree a growin' in the ground
And every time my sweet pass by I'd throw some kisses down
And if he wants more kisses here's all he has to do
Just come up here that kissin' tree and I'll give him some kissin' to
I love a tall man he ain't a small man my man is all man and the only man for me
Now I wish I was a kissin' tree out on the lone prairie
And everytime my sweet pass by he'd steal a kiss from me
And if he wants more kisses here's all he has to know
Just plant me down in a Texas town and watch them kisses grow
I love a tall man he ain't a small man my man is all man and the only man for me
And the only one for me ooh
