Well, the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well, we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33

Yes, we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33

Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you

Oh, all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33

Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33

Four thousandth block proves
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33
