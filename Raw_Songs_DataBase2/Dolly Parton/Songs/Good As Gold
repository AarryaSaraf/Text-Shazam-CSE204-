I'll agree that we may never own a mansion
And the furniture in our house might be old
But we've got something that's worth so much more than money
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

Of course we dream of all the things enjoyed by others
And we've married without even wedding rings
Yet there they envy us so often we've been told
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

I'd love to rush into the house and tell you
That we've got oil in our backyard so I been told
But in a way I'm glad we've not we're so much richer without we've got
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

Of course we dream of all the things enjoyed by others
And we've married without even wedding rings
Yet there they envy us so often we've been told
We've got each other and that's as good as gold
