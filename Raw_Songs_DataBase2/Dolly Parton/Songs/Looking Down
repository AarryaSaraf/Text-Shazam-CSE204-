They say the love we steal is a disgrace
That we should be ashamed to look the world in the face
But they don't know how much love we must hide
While the world looks down upon our pride

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is as true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down

We still honor the vows we made long ago
But when there's no love at home it hurts us so
And then your heart begins to look around
Love found us, now the world's a-looking down

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down

The love we must keep silent hurts us now
But love will always find a way somehow
'Til then the world will look at us and frown
But we'll love each other while they're looking down

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is as true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down
Seems there's always someone looking down
