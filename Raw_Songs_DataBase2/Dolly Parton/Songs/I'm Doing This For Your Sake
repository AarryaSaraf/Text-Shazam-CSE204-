Someone else's arms will hold you my darling baby girl
I'll never get to see the child I've brought into this world
Because I made one mistake folks say that I'm bad
But they just don't understand the way I loved your dad
Now I thought your daddy loved me I was so sure he did
And so I gave him all my love and he said we would wed
But I guess he must chenged his mind cause she left town one day
When he found out about you he just stopped and ran away
In this home so far away from home I leave my heart today
Cause home where the heart is and with you my heart will stay
Because I love you so much why I can't make you pay
So I'm doing this for your sake I'm giving you away
