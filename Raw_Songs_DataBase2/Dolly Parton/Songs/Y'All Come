When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and they'll never ever leave you
Y'all come to see us bye and bye
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then

Now Grandma's a-wishing you'd come out the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
Then they all start a-leaving, and though she's a-grieving
You can still hear grandma say

Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then

Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then
