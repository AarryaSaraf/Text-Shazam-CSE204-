How long will you love me?
How long will you stay by my side?
Will it be for a lifetime or just for a while?
From now on yes, on and on

If you will love and stand by me
I'll give all my love to you
That's the way that it will be
From now on yes, on and on

From now on yes, on and on
From now on, yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on, on and on

I'll stand by you right or wrong
Then we'll always be as one
Like the robin needs his song
I need you from now on

Like the rose loves a vine
Like the poem needs to rhyme
My love is yours and yours is mine
From now on, and on and on

From now on yes, on and on
From now on, yes on and on
Love for each other that will stand the test of time
From now on, on and on
From now on, on and on
