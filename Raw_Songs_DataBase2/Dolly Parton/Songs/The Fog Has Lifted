I can see the sunshine again
And I can see the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted between me and you

I loved you the first time I saw you
For it seemed like I had known you all my life
Well I loved you too but it takes a long time
To know what hurts you what helps you and know how you feel deep inside

I'm so happy you found out before it was too late
Our beautiful love could have turned into hate
Forgiving and understanding gives us a clear view
The fog has lifted between me and you

Now there's the sunshine again
And there's the blue sky where there once was fog and rain
We know each other now clear through and through
The fog has lifted, what a beautiful view, mmm
