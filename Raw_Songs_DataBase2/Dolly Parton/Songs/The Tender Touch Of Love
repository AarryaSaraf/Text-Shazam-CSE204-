I've felt the sturdy hand of fate upon me
And I've felt the stings of love's burning pain
And I've felt the happiness of those around me
But I've never felt the touch of love's sweet hand

The tender touch of love and understanding
That makes your body trembling with true love
They say oh that words could not describe it
Oh but I've never felt the tender touch of love

Though I've felt needy hands say "I love you"
But when the need is gone, they turn away
And leave my heart with emptiness inside it
The hands of hurting touch the empty place

I've never felt the touch of understanding
That makes your body tremble with true love
They say  could not describe it
But I've never felt the tender touch of love

Oh no I've never felt the tender touch of love
