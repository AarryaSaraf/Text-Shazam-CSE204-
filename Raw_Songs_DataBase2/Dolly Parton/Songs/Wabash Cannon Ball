It's good to be back home again at the Sevier Tennessee
I'm awful glad to see you hope you're glad to see me
Now I'd like to say I love you I welcome to you all
Now I know I stole this steam from the Wabash Cannonball

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
Up the hills and down the mountains and the valleys to the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a mighty famous thing called the Wabash Cannonball (Pete Drake)

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
That's that train from Tennessee boys she's long and she's tall
She's a famous choo-choo train called the Wabash Cannonball (yodel)
