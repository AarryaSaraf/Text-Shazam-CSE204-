10-4 over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about
To the world outside we say "10-4 over and out"

Hello, this is Unit 2 callin' Unit 1
This is Unit 2 tryin' Unit 1
Do you read me Unit 1 do you read me?
Yeah, I read you Unit 2
I sure can read you just like a book is all
And I know what you called for I know what you're gonna say
I'm gonna be a little bit late
Well, I know you're a little bit late's are usually two or three or four
Or sometimes even more hours long
And I am sick and tired of it
10-4 over and out

This is Unit 1 callin' Unit 2
Do you read me Unit 2?
You better answer me Unit 2
I'm gettin' sick of foolin' around with this CB radio
I'm gonna cram this thing down your throat
I read you... mhm, do I golly
I read you Unit 1 loud and clear
But seems like there's a little turbulence on the line
Honey, I'm sorry that I'm runnin' so late but I stopped off here
To see this friend of mine who's been awfully awfully sick
And when I got back to the car you know
This radio had run my battery down
I know it's hard for you to believe
Oh, I believe you, I really do believe you
I'll CB-in' you
10-4 over and out
