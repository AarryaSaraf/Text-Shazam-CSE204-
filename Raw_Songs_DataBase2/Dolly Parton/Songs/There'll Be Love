There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love

God created man and woman at the start
And he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love

There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love

For every person somewhere there's a mate
It's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love

You can lock a man behind a prison wall
And you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love

There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love
