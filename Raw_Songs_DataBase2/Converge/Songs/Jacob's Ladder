To say that all of those words meant something
Would be to say that your petty wars killed everything
And I wonder if we ever had one of those moments
Because I can't count the times
I tried to cut away the dead, hoping to grow up again
How much I tried to kill the smiling boy
The burden of falling out of the womb
How much "not enough" I ever received
I will solve these dreams before I wake up this time
This loss weighs, it will always weigh
