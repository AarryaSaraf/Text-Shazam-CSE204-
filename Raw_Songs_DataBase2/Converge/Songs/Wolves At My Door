I've searched with pen and paper
I've searched inside to show you
Just how far I broke from myself
In the name of fear and doubt
In a better world
There would be a better me
Without the chase
That still can't leave me be

Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves

Keep all your wars
I'm going home to bed
I've paid more death
Then you will ever live

Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves

Let me live
Leave me be
Let me live
Leave me

Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
Wolves at my door
