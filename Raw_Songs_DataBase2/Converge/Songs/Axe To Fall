Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall

Sun is sinking, clouds collecting
In a race to stop the bleeding
My will is leaving, darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you

Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall
Waiting for the axe to fall

Sun is sinking, clouds collecting
In a race to stop the bleeding
My will is leaving, darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you

I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this suicide machine
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this destruction

I need to learn to love me
I need to learn to love me
To love me
