I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

I want to be the better me
That you deserve to finally see
The dullest blade sharpens the truth
That every day I'm losing you

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

There's no easy way to say
There's nothing left to say
There's no easy way to say
I destroy everything

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope
Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope

Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope
Please, just don't let me go
Please, just don't give up hope


I'm walking by the trees
To find the missing key
Living in fear of
Vulnerability


I'm walking by the trees

Please, just don't let me go
