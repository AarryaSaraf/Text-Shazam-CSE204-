In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate

Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are
And who you claim to be

No more heroes
No more heroes
No more heroes
No more heroes

In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate
No more gods
No more graves
No more love
No more hate

No more
No more
No more
I walk alone
No more
No more
No more
I walk alone

In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone
In my world of enemies
I walk alone

In vein and valor
Be what they fear
Their days are over
Our nights are here
With hate and heartache
I'll strike you down
With rage and rapture
I crush your crown

Hell hammer comes down
Onto their blade
Our world of widows
Needs to be saved
It's now or never
Victim or victory
Rebel or regret
Who you are
And who you claim to be
