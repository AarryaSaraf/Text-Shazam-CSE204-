Keep on searching
Keep on running
Suicide eyes
Just keep hunting
For new hearts
To break
For old wounds
To make

No one
No one
No one
Will break your fall

Keep on moving
Keep on hiding
In ripe new lives
You're destroying
Finding comfort
In their wreckage
You kill new hope
With old pain

No one
No one
No one
Will break your fall

No one
No one
No one
Will break your fall
No one
No one
No one
Will break your fall
