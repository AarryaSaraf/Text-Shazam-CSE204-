In cold blood I claim this day
I charge blind into the fray
In the name of all my pain
I bare my teeth to make him pay
I sink on down and greet her end
With the worms and the dead
With serpent strength and true hate
I bare my teeth to make her pay

I take my flight

In cold blood I claim this day
I charge blind into the fray
In the name of all my pain
I bare my teeth to make him pay
I sink on down and greet her end
With the worms and the dead
With serpent strength and true hate
I bare my teeth to make her pay

I take my flight

I will take flight
For one last time
With raven wings
And two black eyes
Don't be afraid
With demon speed
The gift of hate
I bare my teeth
To make them pay
Don't be afraid

Nowhere
Nowhere
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere
Nowhere to hide
