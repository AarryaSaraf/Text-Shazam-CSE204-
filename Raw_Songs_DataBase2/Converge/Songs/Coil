Venomously
Winding and weaving
Blood and ivory
Obscure belief

A hidden hunger
Writhing and seething
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen

It's like
A serpent coiled inside
It's like
The sun shone on serpent's lies
And it's like this life
This life

It's like a serpent
Coiled inside me
Sign of the sacred song
Slithering sweetly
Odd with intention
This coil furls on and on

Slither with odd intentions
This coil furls on and on
The sacred song

Venomously
Winding and weaving
Blood and ivory
Obscure belief

A hidden hunger
Writhing and seething
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen

It's like
A serpent coiled inside
It's like
The sun shone on serpent's lies

And it's like
This life, this life

It's like a serpent
Coiled inside me
Sign of the sacred song
Slithering sweetly
Odd with intention
This coil furls on and on

Sign of the sacred song
This coil furls on and on

Sign of the sacred song
This coil furls on and on
Basking in the warmth
Of love unseen
This coil furls on and on
