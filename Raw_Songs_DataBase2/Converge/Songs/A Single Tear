I was so naive
And fearful of the substantive
Of the greying days
Of carrying endless weight
And what it really meant
To truly mean something
To really be someone
Who could be loved

So lost in darkness
In and out of selfishness
Hoarding all my dreams
Was just no way to be
Then you gifted me
Such a precious thing
A chance to be someone
Who deserved love

When I heard (a single tear)
Your cry ring out (a single tear)
It showed me what (a single tear)
Real strength could be (a single tear)

As a single teardrop fell
And was swallowed by the sea
You outshined the best there was
Rewrote who I could be
You outshined the best there was
Rewrote who I could be

When I held you for the first time
I knew I had to survive
When I held you for the first time
I knew I had to survive

As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell
As a single teardrop fell

When I heard (a single tear)
Your cry ring out (a single tear)
It showed me what (a single tear)
Real strength could be (a single tear)

A single tear
A single tear
A single tear
A single tear
