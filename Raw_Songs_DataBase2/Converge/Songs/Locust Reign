Awaken from the bliss of sleep
The daybreak haunts you in such a subtle light
I hear them, they tell me these roads
We have travelled fork up beyond the bend
Beneath the flutter of desperate wings
They sing a song of reclamation
Where tomorrows hanging horizon
Interrupts the hum of electrical towers
Here, there are the shallow graves, the shallower romances
And the shallowest of words still to be spoken
And there you are with open ears
Locust reign on your parade
