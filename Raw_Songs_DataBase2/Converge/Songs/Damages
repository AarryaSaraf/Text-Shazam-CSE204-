Shut your doors, their storm is coming
Of unlived dreams cast away
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall

Shield innocence from hungry tombs
Keep damages from taking you
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall

I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do
To lock the window beasts are climbing through
I'll do anything I can do

My hatred grows as their tears fall
My hatred grows as their tears fall
