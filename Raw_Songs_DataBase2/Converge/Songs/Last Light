I need you to be the strength of widows and soul survivors
I need you to be as fearless as new mothers and new fathers
I need you to be the hope of hearts who lost true love
I need you to be the might of their first kiss

I need a purpose and I need a reason
I need to know there is trophy and meaning
To all we lose and all we fight for
To all our loves and our wars
I need a purpose and I need a reason
I need to know there is trophy and meaning
To all we lose and all we fight for
To all our loves and our wars

Keep breathing
Keep living
Keep searching
Keep bleeding
Keep healing
Keep fading

Keep breathing
Keep living
Keep searching
Keep pushing on
Keep bleeding
Keep healing
Keep fading
Keep shining on
Keep breathing
Keep living
Keep searching
Keep pushing on
Keep bleeding
Keep healing
Keep fading
Keep shining on

This is for the hearts still
Beating
Beating
Beating
Beating
