Invidious judgements move towards an end
Scatter and splatter, the viscera of men
This circle of fire is life on a wire
A culling of hatred, again and again

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
Flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
Flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Inside you
Never felt enough pain
But you were inclined to wonder
Inside you
A war was building
In time

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
To flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed until the silence
Cast them to the void
To flee the fight is violence
Their misery is joy

Bleed
Until (until)
There is silence

Bleed
Until (until)
There is silence
