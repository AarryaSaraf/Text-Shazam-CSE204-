Let me live
Leave me be
Let me live
Leave me
You haunt me
Broken promise
Two year mourning
Dead ringer
Old dead ending
New dead ends
In every sleep my blood boils
It is my sheep they follow
My flocks are falling out of love
Dead ringer
Old dead ending
New dead ends
You haunt me
In pine box days
In red nights coming
Take your crown
Stand your ground
Plague queen
Death king
