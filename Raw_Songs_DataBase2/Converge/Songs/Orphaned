Bright eyes fading
Young eyes beaten
To black and blue
Sunrise has been sinking
Since I was two

One wounded
And another dead
One wounded
And another dead

I've spent years
Building up these walls
When all this time
My sky has been falling

Burden to bare
This anger is
Empty but heavy
My heart carries
The weight of your world

One wounded
And another dead
One wounded
And another dead

My wounds are open
I'm out of blood

Bright eyes fading
Young eyes beaten
To black and blue
Sunrise has been sinking
Since I was two

Burden to bare
This anger is
Empty but heavy
My heart carries
The weight of your world
