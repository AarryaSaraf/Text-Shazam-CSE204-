I'm stopping this slow death
By letters never sent
I'm killing one way romance
And its words never read
I'm leaving love's lost battles
To the vulture's need to feed
I'm leaving you
I'm leaving them
And learning to be me
Heart is everything
Heart is you
Love is you
Hell is you
Loss is you
Heartless
