Thousand miles
Forgetting
Anything
Everything
Wheels racing

Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud

Engine roars
Rain pours down
The chase is on
My black cloud
Gaining ground

Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud

Three years spent
Outrunning
My demon
And her ring
Keep moving

Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud

With engine heart
And boiled blood
I'll push on down
My wounded roads
I can outrun
Outrun you all
Horsepower hope
Find me a home
In brand new arms
That won't let go
I can outrun
Outrun you all

Race
Racing on
Race
Racing on to my end
Race
Racing on
Race
Racing on to my end

Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud gaining
Black cloud
