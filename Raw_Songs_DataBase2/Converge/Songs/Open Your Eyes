Don't tell anyone sorry, just tell yourself
Just because you're sober doesn't mean you're someone else
You don't make it all better, it doesn't work
Can't you see the damage you've done will always fucking hurt?

(Open your eyes)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
The one you hate the most
Has the same look in her eyes
Open your eyes (sometimes)
Open your eyes (sometimes)

Don't tell anyone sorry, just tell yourself
Just because you're sober doesn't make you someone else
You don't make it all better, it doesn't work
Can't you see the damage you've done will always fucking hurt?

Sometimes it helps to yell out
What's inside if no one hears
There's nothing left behind
No writing on the wall
Nothing etched in stone
The emotions are for me
And myself alone
Don't tell me you feel
Your sympathy isn't real
Hollow gumption
You're forced to take too much inbreeding
I knew you were a mistake

Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes (open your fucking eyes)

(Open your eyes)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
The one you hate the most
Has the same look in her eyes
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
Welcome to the real fucking world

You say you're so sorry
You don't know what sorry is
