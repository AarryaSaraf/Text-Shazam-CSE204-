For words, two minutes, three years
For my fingertips to grow numb
Could this be the moment
When the "finally" becomes the "wish I could"?
Desperation and outstretched memories
Now I see you only in bad dreams
I never reset
I only see you in bad dreams
Let me explain
Close enough to feel your words
Far enough to read your flesh
