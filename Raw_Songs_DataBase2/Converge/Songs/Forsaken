The cedar doesn't do much for these memories
I am as cold as the monuments you left for me
And another one passes in the evening
A knee deep grave and the two that raised
And a tin box for the two that I loved
And I carry on
Please lay out my best suit for me
And tell me every word you want to hear
Every word you have said to yourself to be perfect in the end
And I carry on
A tin box for the two that loved
Carry on
