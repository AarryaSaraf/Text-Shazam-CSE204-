To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

This raging sea won't have you
This weary grave won't keep you
These tired arms won't hold you
As she closes her doors

To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

Inferno dreams won't leave you
This moonless night won't guide you
These brittle ghosts won't love you
As she closes her doors

Queen of guilt
Queen of grief

To the lions
As she closes her doors
To the lions
To end this night

This raging sea won't have you
This weary grave won't keep you
These tired arms won't hold you
As she closes her doors

Queen of guilt
Queen of grief

Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
Remember them
