Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do

Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world

Down by your side
I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arm across the bed
You make no move
You never do

Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage, own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn
My wretched world

My wretched world
My wretched world
My wretched world

(To stand in your shadow is to be home)
