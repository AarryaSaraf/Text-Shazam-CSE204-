Dear, just one day, just another fight
Just one more lonely night
Just one more crowd under the burning lights
(With some blood and mind to be paid)
To my friends to my family
I tried to be the best man I could ever be
I tasted their failure on the entrance way
(With some blood and mind to be paid)
To my greatest of demons, I beat you
I beat you
