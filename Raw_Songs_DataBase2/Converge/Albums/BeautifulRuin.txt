Album: BeautifulRuin

// Permanent Blue //

A permanent kind of blue
Takes host inside of you
It grips the spine and twists
And nests where it sees fit
The tears will only feed
Your delirium machine
As your god falls fast asleep
And dies in the dream

Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again

Angel grounded by the storm
Contemplating her life's work
Antiseptic answers ring
Esoterically in key
The synthetic everything
That breeds and comes to be
Are the perils of the deep
In the opiate sea

Passivity will only lead you
To the mouth of tragedy
Pasivity will only lead you
To the mouth of tragedy

Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again
Pollution of paradise
You'll never see me again
Pollution of paradise
I'll never see you alive again

// Churches And Jails //

Truth is the devil's work
A blade won't slow the heart of the enemy
We are not willing to see

In order to starve the monster
We must behead the beast
In order to starve the monster
We must behead the beast

The churches and jails
The churches and jails

Truth is the devil's work
A blade won't slow the heart of the enemy
We are not willing to see

In order to starve the monster
We must behead the beast
In order to starve the monster
We must behead...

The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
The churches and jails
We have to behead the beast

Truth is the devil's work
Truth is the devil's work

// Melancholia //

If loneliness was our long lost art
I just have to ask
Where did we all go wrong

We were the black keys to every white lie
Basking in the glow
Of a heaven burning bright
And the clouds were ghosts
Of forgotten dreams
Filling voids in absence of all good things

Forgive and forget was the path to regret
And we needed to find a better way out
Who will we be without enemies
Who will we be without
The push and pull

...In love with melancholy
Fatally, beautifully
In love with melancholy
Melancholy

// Beautiful Ruin //

Beautiful ruin
Portrait built from splinters of youth
Stairway to nowhere
The connection from me to you
Distort normalcy
Validate malignancy
The smear of spite detaches me
Brings me to my knees

Pain means nothing without purpose
Love means nothing without roots

Beautiful ruin
Portrait built from splinters of youth
Stairway to nowhere
The connection from me to you
Distort normalcy
Validate malignancy
The smear of spite detaches me
Brings me to my knees

Pain means nothing without purpose
Love means nothing without roots

Nothing
Pain means nothing
Love means nothing
Pain means nothing
Love means nothing
