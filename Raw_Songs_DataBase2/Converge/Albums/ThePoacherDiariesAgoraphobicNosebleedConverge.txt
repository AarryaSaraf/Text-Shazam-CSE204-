// Locust Reign //

Awaken from the bliss of sleep
The daybreak haunts you in such a subtle light
I hear them, they tell me these roads
We have travelled fork up beyond the bend
Beneath the flutter of desperate wings
They sing a song of reclamation
Where tomorrows hanging horizon
Interrupts the hum of electrical towers
Here, there are the shallow graves, the shallower romances
And the shallowest of words still to be spoken
And there you are with open ears
Locust reign on your parade

// This is Mine //

And the clouds they break above our best intentions
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
And the thunderclap, we see who we are
And this is all I have, this is all we are
The ground shakes with your every smile
And hearts are crushed in an instant
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
And the thunderclap, we see who we are
Three years then four days, and one sentence later
I rise from ruin, this is all I have, this is mine
Today, I rise from ruin

// They Stretch For Miles //

Up for days cutting losses and trading in the most precious of wings
The nights never end, and these ghosts will never know true rest
They stretch for miles, they take me home
In the name of love and you I say...
Sometimes when you win the war you lose it all
Towering, they stretch for miles
Speaking as eloquently as the tallest of tales
They stretch for miles
They take me home

// My Great Devastator //

No, I'll lay half empty
Half finished, half written, until my end
I'll leave the lights on just in case you want to be found again
To the dead, I wrote you countless letters
Dear only some I sent
How easy it was for silence to say
Some of the loudest of things
To speak so effortlessly the words and syllables
That can crush in an instant
To our end, to the dear departed
Are you my last chance or the first chapter
In the greatest fable ever told
For the rope is getting shorter and these days
They are getting longer with every ghosts I find
They leave no heart unbroken, my great devastator
To our end, to the dear departed
Are you my last chance or the first chapter
In the greatest fable ever told
I'll leave the lights on just in case you want to be found again
My great devastator

// The Human Shield //

Were it all had meaning, were we fell in love for the first time
It erupts in nights like this, tangled in the simplicity of...
Some far off distant evening with hearts filled to the brim
With good intentions and the sweetest of tragedy
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your head
Arms spread wide like Jesus, without the heart
Or cowardice, or mouthful of easy answers
Headlong we pace into the killing fields
Born of fevers and the brooding night sweats
And the war about to be waged
Stop crying, just give me the keys
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your head
Stop crying, just give me the fucking keys
Headlong into the killing fields
These days I am becoming bulletproof
The bells are ringing, it's the end of the line
I'm becoming your fears
I'm becoming every broken heart
I hope you hear me coming, I hope you turn your head

// Minnesota //

Dear, just one day, just another fight
Just one more lonely night
Just one more crowd under the burning lights
(With some blood and mind to be paid)
To my friends to my family
I tried to be the best man I could ever be
I tasted their failure on the entrance way
(With some blood and mind to be paid)
To my greatest of demons, I beat you
I beat you
