Album: HardTimesForLovers

// Hard Times For Lovers //

Seems it was just a while ago
All of my friends and I
Went to each others weddings
And stood by each others sides
And became brides

Talking on the phone to Kurt today
He said that he and Liz were through
And by the way that
Things have been going
You could say that they were overdue

For every other married pair of us
That already split in two
Each of us turning our own lives alone
For sleeping with someone new
Ain't it true

These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone singing, I gotta be me
Without you

Now, honey, I'm supposed to tell you
I've got to live for today
And don't you know it is my lifetime
I've got to live it my own way

And lately, I can't help thinking
I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show
I don't know

These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone singing, I gotta be me
Without you

But lately, I can't help thinking
I reap what I sow
For all of my holy freedom
What have I got to show
I don't know

These are hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone singing, I gotta be me
Without you

Ain't these hard times for lovers
Everyone wants to be free
Ain't these hard times for lovers

// Marie //

You looked like a princess the night we met
With your hair piled up high
I will never forget
I'm drunk right now baby
But I've got to be
Or I never could tell you
What you meant to me

I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie

You're the song
That the trees sing when the wind blows
You're a flower, you're a river, you're a rainbow
Sometimes I'm crazy
But I guess you know
And I'm weak and I'm lazy
And I've hurt you so
And I don't listen to a word you say
When you're in trouble I just turn away

I love you, I loved you, the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie
I loved you the first time I saw you
And I always will love you Marie

// Happy End //

You'll always love me
So why'd you leave me
You can't convince me
That you don't miss me
You'll be coming back
You're running back

It can't be over
You know you need me
It's not the ending
I saw the movie
And the girl comes back
Comes running back

To happy ending's
Just a minor bending
A little pretense
My little defense
It's a happy end, a happy end
A motion picture, a great elixir
A slight illusion, a bit of magic
A little romance to tide me over

The day is over
The moon is rising
Bright yellow disc
On a purple horizon
And the boy got the girl
And the good guys won
They rode into the sun

To happy ending's
Just a minor bending
A little pretense
My little defense
It's a happy end, a happy end
A motion picture, a great elixir
A slight illusion, a bit of magic
A little romance to tide me over

I never loved you
I only used you
And though you've left me
It doesn't phase me
You'll be coming back
You're running back

// Desperado //

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
You been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one,
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts
Is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get

Desperado
Oh you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger,
They're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom,
Well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin'
Through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
And open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

// I Remember Sky //

I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
And light and noise and bees and boys
And days

I remember days or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze

And the bluest ink isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky

// Starmaker //

Here, as I watch the ships go by
I'm rooted to my shore
And I keep asking myself why
And if there's more on the other side

Here, as I see the friends I thought I'd made
A little bit crazed, and knowing now
We've outgrown one another

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Now when I see the things I want
I can take the things I see
But I keep asking myself why
And if there ain't just a little bit more to me

For here, when there's time to count the cost
I keep measuring what I've lost
And wondering if you knew
It would all wind up with you

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Here, as I watch the time go by
How I'd like to sail away
Leaving all my past behind
But I know I'd only last for a couple of days

For here stands everything I thought I made
It's the only life I've known
And I can't even call it my own
I've got no home, I belong to you

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

My starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

// Dorothy //

Living in Kansas
A life alone
She never married
She's hardly known
She stares out the window far away
Looking for another windy day

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
She was afraid
She could have stayed

It seems like only yesterday
But forty years have up and slipped away
Since a lovely black haired girl
Was taken from her one and only world

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
But was afraid
She could have stayed

Same old bluebirds flying high
Over rainbows in the Kansas sky
Why oh why
Oh why

I guess it only serves her right
For trading all that color for black and white
All her sorrow
All because
There ain't no way to stand Kansas
When you've been to Oz

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
But was afraid
She could have stayed
She could have stayed
She could have stayed

// I'll Never Say Goodbye //

Say goodbye
Why I can barely say goodnight?
If I can hardly take my eyes from yours
How far can I go?

Walk away
The thought would never cross my mind
I couldn't turn my back on spring or fall
Your smile least of all

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I'm not afraid to say I love you
And I promise you, I'll never say goodbye

We're dancers on a crowded floor
While other dancers live from song to song
Our music goes on, on and on

And if I never leave your arms
I really would have traveled everywhere
For my world is there

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I am not afraid to say I love you
And I promise you, I'll never say goodbye
How could I ever say goodbye?

// Through The Eyes Of Love //

Please don't let this feeling end
It's everything I am
Everything I want to be
Finding out what's mine now
Finding out what's true
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

Now I can take the time
I can see my life
And it comes up shining
Reaching out to touch you
I can feel so much
You seem all so new
Looking through the eyes of love

Now I do believe
That even in the storm
We'll find some light
Knowing you're beside me
I'm all right

Please don't let this feeling end
It might not come again
And I want to remember
How it feels to hold you
How I feel so much
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

How it feels to hold you
How I feel so much
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

// Where Or When //

It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

Things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when
