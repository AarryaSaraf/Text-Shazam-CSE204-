// Only You //

Looking from the window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
Moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more (Can't take no more)
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind closed doors

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew (All I ever knew)
Only you

// Sweetheart On Parade //

Everybody loves to love
The local girl made good
Surely I'd find peace of mind
If anybody could

Still at times I find myself
Wishing they were right
If everybody loves me
Where are they tonight?

Everybody loves to love
The sweetheart on parade
Out there on the stage tonight
The girl who's got it made

But after the applause is gone
I sometimes wish I knew
Why everybody loves me
And I love only you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give?
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live?
All I need is someone I can share it with

But how they love to love
The golden girl next door
Up there with her name in lights
Now who could ask for more?

Still I can't help wondering
Why it should be true
That everybody loves me
Everyone but you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give?
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live?
All I need is someone I can share it with

Everybody loves me, everyone but you

// Everybody Works In China //

Nothin' comes easy in the land of the free
I leave my name and my number with the agency
They don't hurry gettin' back to me
So I sleep all day and I watch TV
The sun is settin' but I still in my bed
Takin' something for my achin' head
I used to run just to get out the lead
But now I just change the channels instead

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes

All this hangin' round makes me feel like a fool
Sometimes I dream I'm 18 and I'm back in school
Jokin' around and fallin' in love
Nothing more to be thinkin' of

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yeah

So if I could
I'd take my money and I'd take my guy
Hop on a plane, and fly up in the sky
Sit by the window, watch the world go by
Never worry at all
I'd just be havin' a ball

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yeah

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes

Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody works in China
Everybody
Oh yeah

Everybody works in China
From the old man right down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes, oh yes...

// Yellow Kimono //

She's asks the operator
For a long-distance line
And now she's estimating
Tokyo time
He should be rising
She should be asleep
Sweet music she hears
Those telephone beeps

It's been a week now
Since he left home
Saying, "I'm sorry
But I have to go
It won't be long
And I'll bring you back home
A yellow kimono"

She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time

A glass in her hand
And the sound turned down low
She watches him talking
On a late TV show
It's been a rough day now
And she's missing him so
And that yellow kimono

She can't understand it
Why there's no reply
So she asks the operator
To try one more time
A million thoughts
Are going 'round in her mind
Those Geisha girls
And that hot sake wine

She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She wakes in the morning
With the kids 'round the bed
"Hey look, mommy, mommy
What daddy has sent"
She opens the parcel
Containing no note
Just a yellow kimono

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time

// From Where I Stand //

From where I stand, I see the bridges burning
From where I stand, our love is going down
And it looks like stormy weather
My dreams have all gone home
We standing close together
And I'm feelin' all alone

I wonder when you knew you didn't need me
I wonder how it ever came to this
So far from where we started
To where we are today
I was standing in your shadow
Now I'm standing in your way

And I know I'll understand the reasons
I know I'll even bless the pain
But it's hard to watch the change of seasons
When hope is melting in the rain

So close your eyes, it isn't worth the crying
The sun will rise and dry your tears away
And oh, there's no hard feelings
I wish you all the best
Just leave behind your memory
And the devil take the rest

And I watch you turn and walk away
I find there's nothing left to say
I can't go back to yesterday
I'll never find the way
From where I stand

// Home Again //

You picked me up when I was down
With pure and simple love you turned my life around
You gave to me a sense of worth
When I thought there was no mercy left upon the earth
And through your eyes I saw a brighter view
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

I was a restless man who never felt content
Until you came into my life and showed me what it meant
And only you knew what I was going through
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me

Sometime when I awake at dawn
I'm still afraid it's all a dream and you'll be gone
But I'll be here with you my whole life through
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me
But home is anyplace when you're with me

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me

// Shoot First //

The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he has girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him

Go get your guns, it's time to play
Let's hurry up, don't waste the day
Out in the park we'll stage a fight
Just like on the TV

You play the one who has to die
I'll shoot the gun and you will cry
You will fall down and I will run
Just like on the TV

My daddy has a gun for real
He says he'll teach me to use it
I'm gonna have my own someday
Just like on the TV

My daddy told me what to do
If anybody bothers you
He says the law is on our side
Just like on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

My older brother has his own
It's got a handle made of bone
He carries it all over town
Just like on the TV

My daddy gave my mama one
Genuine real pearl handled gun
She says she gonna have some fun
Just like on the TV

Did you see who got shot last night?
I stayed up to watch him
They rushed him off to surgery
Right there on the TV

Gosh, I hope they catch the guy
I think they ought to shoot him
But if they bring him in alive
He'll be on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

I've got to go, it's getting late
I wish I had a real gun
Then I would never be afraid
Like some guys on TV

I'd never use my gun on you
You'd never have to worry
You'd be the good guy on my side
Just like on the TV

I think when I grow up someday
I'm gonna be a Green Beret
I saw them sailing off to war
Last night on the TV

My daddy says it's not a game
We've got to play to win it
He says I'll have to learn to fight
Just like on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

Shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

"Land of song", said the warrior bard
Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword at least thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee

// Don't Say Love //

Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love

Oh babe, I'm doin' all I can
To keep my heart from bein' broken
Makin' these long range plans
And not a word has yet been spoken
We're takin' the long way around it
You say you want me and I don't doubt it
But honey, I've lost at love before
Ain't tryin' to rush, but I gotta know

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love

Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love

Don't say you love me if you're not for certain
'Cause I don't wanna be the one left hurtin'
Don't say you love me 'til you think it over
You gotta make sure you're right
And I just might wait for one more night

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say
Do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say
Do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
...

// Dream On //

Pinch me darlin' I think I'm dreamin'
This is too good to be true
I've spent my whole life looking around
For a man I know now was you

Where have you been hiding yourself
All of my lonely nights?
If you're a dream, don't let me wake
Let me dream on

I spent a lot of years running around
Walking fast in little towns
I had a lot of men offer me love
And I didn't turn all of them down

I never knew a man like you
Never in my born days
If you're a dream, oh, don't let me wake
Let me dream on

Let me sleep if I'm dreamin'
Let me sleep on
Dreamin' of you

I've never been so close to heaven
Never felt so much at home
It's like an old-time forty's movie
Where nobody winds up alone

I knew somewhere there were dreams coming true
Finally one of them is mine
If you're a dream, please let me believe
That life could be so fine

Let me sleep if I'm dreamin'
Let me sleep on
Dreamin' of you
All of my life I've been dreamin'
Let me wake up here in this dream with you

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on

Dream on
Dream on
Let me dream on
Dream on

// The Best Is Yet To Come //

What did we do wrong?
We had all the magic to guide us on our way
And all the tragedy we could ever want to see
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

Where did we go wrong?
Was it all so enlightening we couldn't find our way?
Was it all so frightening we couldn't see which move to make?
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

And if you leave me now
As you say you might
Oh, please don't leave me now
'Cause I know, if you do
None of this will come true so

Where do we go now?
Now your heart is aching and leading you astray
And me, I'm shaking up, trying to get you to stay
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come
And you know the best is still to come
