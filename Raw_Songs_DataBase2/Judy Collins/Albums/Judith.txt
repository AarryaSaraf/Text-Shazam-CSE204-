// The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress //

See her how she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold

The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Good lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Though with the mountains and the pine
Then the darkness fell

The moon's a harsh mistress
It's hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
Fell out of her heart
Fell down on my face
I tripped and missed my star
Fell and fell alone

The moon's a harsh mistress
The sky is made of stone
The moon's a harsh mistress
She's hard to call your own

// Angel, Spread Your Wings //

Prisoners of the heart in search of love and peace
Hung in desperation, longing for release
I'm just a traveler, angel, you're my ride
Take me past the place I've passed the last time that I died

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel comes into my room, it's dark and so is she
Wants to know if she can take me soaring out to sea
Lying in her darkness like a child awaiting birth
Angel comes and takes me for everything I'm worth

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Take me in your arms, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Spread your wings and take me
Spread your wings and make me
I know, I know, I know, I know you're dying to
Fly away forever, fly away forever, fly away forever
Angel spread your wings

Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, I want to fly away with you
Angel spread your wings, angel spread your wings

// The Lovin' Of The Game //

I watched the feather river glide
Over shinin' golden sand
Struck the silver ribbon wide
Held a million in my hand
But besides the lookin' for
The finding's always tame
And there's nothin' drives a gambler
Like the lovin' of the game

All my life I've searched around
Travelin' hard from town to town
But I never really found
Anything to tie me down
Still I would not trade my time
For a solid diamond claim
No, I would not trade a fortune
For the lovin' of the game

So long Darlin' don't you cry
I hope that things turn out for you
All these good times goin' by
Got to get ourselves a few
Where I'm going has no end
What I'm seeking has no name
Oh the treasure's not for takin
It's the lovin' of the game
The lovin' of the game

// Song For Duke //

I didn't even know the man
I didn't know the man himself
Even though his music filled my life
As it has so many others

I knew that he had died that week
After fighting death a year or more
But I had had a rule before
That funerals were a waste of flowers

But something said I had to go
To be a witness to his gift of love
A man who never once gave up on life
Until death took him in his tracks

The people stood around the church
Ten thousand people there they say, or more
Black and white, rich and poor
Together they were there to say farewell

In New York City it had rained that day
The streets were silver and the sky was gray
But in the church the music soared and sang
And seemed to fill the air with shining sun

The man was a hero
He played the music of our souls
He knew that we all have in us
A place where beauty always grows

Outside in the streets again
The people wandered through the falling rain
They waved their hands and dried their tears
And turned to go about their lives again

But none of us will be the same
If we hear the things his music says
That loving is the gift of life
And making music was his way of love

The man was a hero
He played the music of our souls
He knew that we all have in us
A place where beauty always grows

// Salt Of The Earth //

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Say a prayer for the common foot soldier
Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children
Who turn the fires and who still till the earth

When I see these crowd of faces
A swirling mass of black and gray and white
They look so real to me
But they look so much [?]

Raise your glass to the hard working people
Let's drink to the uncounted heads
Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead

Spare a thought for the stay at home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
See the parading of gray suited grafters
The world is charming and they don't want to know

And when I see these crowd of faces
A swirling mass of gray and black and white
They look so real to me
And they look so much [?]

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the hard working people
Let's think of the lowly of birth
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth
Let's drink to the people
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

// Brother, Can You Spare A Dime //

They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When there was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always there, right out on the job

They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Once I built a railroad, made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

Once I built a tower to the sun
Built of brick and water, and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, gee, we looked fine
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-Dum
Half a million boots went slogging through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

Oh say, don't you remember they called me 'Al'?
It was 'Al' all the time
Say, don't you remember I am your pal?
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

// I'll Be Seeing You //

Cathedral bells were tolling and our hearts rang on
Was this the thrill of Paris or the April dawn?
Who knows if we shall meet again
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again

I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In the small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's bright and gay, I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you

I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you

// Pirate Ships //

Far away, far away, child
Turn your eyes far away, child
Mama will sleep right down beside you tonight
Mama will sleep tonight

Pirate ships, pirate ships, child
Merry and bold, sparkling and rich, child
Coming to dock right at your feet tonight
Coming to dock tonight

In the stars, in the stars, child
See the people in the stars, child
They will fly right through your window tonight
Into your window tonight

Mama will sleep right down beside you tonight
Mama will sleep tonight, far away
