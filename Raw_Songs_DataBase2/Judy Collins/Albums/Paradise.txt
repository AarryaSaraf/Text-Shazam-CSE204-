Album: Paradise

// The Last Thing On My Mind //

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my heart is turning
In your hand, in your hand

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

You've got reasons a-plenty for going
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing
Please don't go, please don't go

As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my heart lies a burning
Without you, without you

Are you going away with no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could have loved you better, didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
