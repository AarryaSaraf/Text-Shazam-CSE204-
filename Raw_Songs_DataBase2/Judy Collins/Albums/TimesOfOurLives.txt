// Great Expectations //

So say goodbye and turn around
You're set free and I let down
Down is never been a place I care to stay
So babe I am as good has gone
I never care it taught us long
For ever it's tonight for tomorrow
So they say is a brand new day

And I have great expectations of love again in my life
They'll be great celebrations of love again in my life
I believe in beginning again
I expect to be winning again
I intend to have love in my life

One million chances on the street
On every corner glances meet
Somewhere in this city perfect strangers wait

Strangers wait for a destiny
And one or several wait for me
And somewhere in this city love will take me by surprise
And I will fall or I may rise

I have great expectations of love again in my life
They'll be great celebrations of love again in my life
I believe in beginning again
I expect to be winning again
I intend to have love in my life

// The Rest Of Your Life //

Every mother has to let he child go
Even though it may tear her apart
I can hear the lullabies I sang you
Now you stand taller than my heart

You know you can bread my heart so easily
You can make my day with just a smile
One word from you can melt the winter snow
Make me forget the longest mile

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free
I've gotta set you free

The road we walked was never easy
I know I stumbled on the way
I thought I knew what I was doing
When I was wrong you had to pay

I hope by now you can forgive me
And take the good I had to give
I was too young to be your teacher
We learned together how to live

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free

I only hope you will be happy
I want the very best for you
The only prize that's worth the battle
Is finding love you know is true

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free

// Grandaddy //

Grandaddy look at the gypsies
Dancing in the firelight burning so brightly
How do they keep themselves warm on such a night?

See all the fiddlers twirling
While he plays his violin laughing and shouting
Have you seen anything like it in all your life?

Grandma was cold and chide when we get in
She'll wanna know what we've done and where we've been
Promise me you'll never tell, ya know your secret's safe with me
I can be trusted

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Can we go down to the railroad tracks
And watch the train go by shining like silver?
I hear the whistle, the train is on it's way

Hold me up over your shoulder
So that I can see the light over the pine trees
How I would like to go riding on the train

Tell me the story again about the time you went away
You went to Chicago, no one knew where you were
Why did you ever come back here after you had run away?
I'm glad you did sir

Wrap me in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Grandaddy tell me the names of all
The stars up in the sky, is there a heaven?
Do you think there is a life after we die?

Why do some people have all the
Gold and silver they can spend? Others have nothing
It isn't fair and I've always wondered why

Can I hold the match while you light your pipe?
I love the smell of tobacco in the air
Tell me again about how it was before I came to be
In the old country
When you were young you sailed up on the sea

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

I'll be safe tonight

// It's Gonna Be One Of Those Nights //

there are nights made out of magic
Magic nights when dreams come true
Nights like that can fall to anybody
Even me and you

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Darling, tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights

So kill the lights and light the candles
And turn your favorite station on
Sometime tonight no matter what they're playing
They're gonna be playing our song

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights

It's gonna be one of those nights of magic midnight blue
And everybody is allowed a few

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
One of those star-spangled nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Darling, tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights...

One of those times of our lives
Tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see...

One of those times of our lives...

// Memory //

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every streetlamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And the streetlamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun

// Sun Son //

Oh, father, come to the window, look over yonder lake
What a wondrous golden city beyond the icy wake
In my short life we've passed this way ten times or more
And never did a city rise up on that far shore

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la

Big buildings at its center stand ablaze with light
While other spires around these and trap the beams in flight
Oh, look now, I see people with faces small and fine
And in their midst just staring, a boy's face like mine

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la

The sun was sinking, 'cause night was falling
The boy went after sleep
His wondrous city vanished into the icy deep
The moon was rising, 'cause night was falling
And now was as before
As we made our way through the countless pines
On the cold lake's northern shore

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la...

// Mama Mama //

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

Doin' ninety-five in the middle of the night on an open road
Time for a good ol' girl like me to be bedded down
Gotta get home before the kids find out I've been away
I figure I'm gonna reach town just before dawn

I can see the sun is gonna be comin' up real soon
Hope the children don't wake up and wonder where I am
Gotta get the older ones to school and play with the baby
She's the apple of her mother's eye, and doesn't she know it

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's running' out and the other kids are cryin'
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy
Doin' what I can to raise my babies

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

Wonder if you know just how it feels to be alone
Tryin' to raise a bunch of kids on nothin' but love and guts
When the day is over I'm about as wrecked as a body can be
I got my troubles, but again I need me some kind of lovin'

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy
Doin' what I can to raise my babies

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

The doctor down in Lincoln said I'd be all right
He said he didn't want to help me but he'd do it just this once
Made me feel so bad I couldn't stop the tears from fallin'
Made me wish he had to pay this kind of price for his lovin'

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'
Five kids are gonna drive me crazy
Lord, I can't have another baby

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

// Drink A Round To Ireland //

Father was a singing man, most of what he sang
Had to do with Ireland, the place from where he came
Ireland of his childhood, Ireland of his spring
To return to Ireland was his dream

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ, who died for Irishmen

I guess he left his dreams to me after he was gone
And there were many years to come when I sang my father's song
And so I came to Ireland, here I live today
Lately I've been wondering why I stay

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ who died for Irishmen

Dad, I think you're fortunate your dreams did not come true
I know that it would break your heart to see the things we do
If you could see the murder here, if you could feel the pain
To see the way we live would bring you shame

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ who died for Irishmen

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ, who died for Irishmen

// Angel On My Side //

There was a time when the clocks all stopped
When the world just went away,
I didn't know if it was night or day.
I didn't know if there were clouds or fire in the sky,
I didn't want to live if I could die.
Somewhere down the line I found myself up on that road,
Where the devil led me, I would go.
I had sold my soul for pleasure,
Thinkin' it would last,
All my hopes had vanished in the past.

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,
Driftin' away with the tide.
God only knows how I made it back home.
I must have an angel on my side.

In the mornin' I'd wake up and shake my weary head,
Wonder where I'd been and what I'd said.
Was I on the River Styx for all eternity?
Would I drown forever in the sea?
Why did anyone keep livin', what was there to find?
I wanted just a little peace of mind.

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,
Driftin' away with the tide.
God only knows how I made it back home.
I must have an angel on my side.

Never had a flash of lightnin' comin' right at me,
One day I just know I woke up free.
The day was breakin', I was livin',
I couldn't tell you why,
First I laughed and then I learned to cry.
Somethin' in my heart was sayin' you can reach the sky,
You just gotta live until you die.

Lost, I was lost like a child in the dark,
Driftin' away with the tide.
God only knows how I made it back home.
I must have an angel on my side.
I must have an angel,
I must have an angel,
I must have an angel on my side.

// Don't Say Goodbye Love //

Love don't say you can't forgive me
How can I bear to live if you say goodbye?
God has mercy, can't you spare some?
I am begging you to stay, if it's just a lie

I'll take the crumbs you leave at my door
I just can't bear not to see you anymore
Those years of love can't be gone
Take me with you, don't leave me here alone

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

Nightmares come, I know, I've had one
Why can't I be awake? Say it's just a dream
This is all too real for dreaming
Like something in a play, truer then it seems

How did your face of love turn to hate?
Only a moment passed, now it is too late
Blind to the truth I have loved
Lost for now, I am helpless without you

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

High above, the moon is riding
Clouds covering her face so she can not see
Tears are falling from my own eyes
Hope dying in my heart, struggles to be free

I want to hide in the past
Where I thought that I'd found love at last
Love that would suffer my sins
Love that would let me begin to live

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
