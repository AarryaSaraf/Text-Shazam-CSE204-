Out under the winter sky
Out under the winter sky
Stars come trembling on my eye
Stars to tremble my eye

And I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
Hand me wings for to fly

High is heaven in early morn
High is heaven in early morn
Men lie sleeping in beds that are warm
Sleep in beds that are warm

And I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
Tells my soul not to moan
