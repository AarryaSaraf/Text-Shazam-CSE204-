Grandaddy look at the gypsies
Dancing in the firelight burning so brightly
How do they keep themselves warm on such a night?

See all the fiddlers twirling
While he plays his violin laughing and shouting
Have you seen anything like it in all your life?

Grandma was cold and chide when we get in
She'll wanna know what we've done and where we've been
Promise me you'll never tell, ya know your secret's safe with me
I can be trusted

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Can we go down to the railroad tracks
And watch the train go by shining like silver?
I hear the whistle, the train is on it's way

Hold me up over your shoulder
So that I can see the light over the pine trees
How I would like to go riding on the train

Tell me the story again about the time you went away
You went to Chicago, no one knew where you were
Why did you ever come back here after you had run away?
I'm glad you did sir

Wrap me in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Grandaddy tell me the names of all
The stars up in the sky, is there a heaven?
Do you think there is a life after we die?

Why do some people have all the
Gold and silver they can spend? Others have nothing
It isn't fair and I've always wondered why

Can I hold the match while you light your pipe?
I love the smell of tobacco in the air
Tell me again about how it was before I came to be
In the old country
When you were young you sailed up on the sea

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

Wrap me up in your winter coat
Wrap me up so tight
I never will feel the cold
I'll be warm tonight

I'll be safe tonight
