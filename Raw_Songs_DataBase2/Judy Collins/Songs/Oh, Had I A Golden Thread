Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I would weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design, of rainbow design

In it I'd weave the bravery
Of women giving birth
And in it I would weave the innocence
Of children of all the earth, children of all the earth

Show my brothers and sisters my rainbow design
I would bind up this sorry world
With hand and my heart and mind
Hand and heart and mind

Oh, had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I I would weave a magic strand
Of rainbow design, of rainbow design
