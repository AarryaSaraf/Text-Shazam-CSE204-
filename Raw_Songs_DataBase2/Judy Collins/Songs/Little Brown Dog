I buyed me a little dog its color it was brown
Taught him to whistle to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long his ears they were broad
Round the world in half a day on him I could ride
Sing terry O' day

I buyed me a little bull he was four inches high
Everybody feared him who ever heard him cry
When he began to bellow he made such melodious sound
That all the walls in London came tumblin' to the ground
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a flock of sheep thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool sometimes yielded feathers
I know mine are the very best sheep for yield and increase
Every full and turn of the moon they bring forth lambs and geese
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little glass colored it was green
In it was all the wonders man has ever seen
I put in my pocket tied up with a cloth
Cried and cried the day I found that it had been lost
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little dog its color it was brown
Taught him to whistle to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long his ears they were broad
Round the world in half a day on him I could ride
Sing terry O day
Sing terry O day
