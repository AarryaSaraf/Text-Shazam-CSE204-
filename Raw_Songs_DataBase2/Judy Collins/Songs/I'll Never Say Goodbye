Say goodbye
Why I can barely say goodnight?
If I can hardly take my eyes from yours
How far can I go?

Walk away
The thought would never cross my mind
I couldn't turn my back on spring or fall
Your smile least of all

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I'm not afraid to say I love you
And I promise you, I'll never say goodbye

We're dancers on a crowded floor
While other dancers live from song to song
Our music goes on, on and on

And if I never leave your arms
I really would have traveled everywhere
For my world is there

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I am not afraid to say I love you
And I promise you, I'll never say goodbye
How could I ever say goodbye?
