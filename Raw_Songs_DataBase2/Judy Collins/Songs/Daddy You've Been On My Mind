Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But Daddy, you've been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please, don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading or saying I can't forget
I do not walk the floor bowed down and bent but yet
Daddy, you're just on my mind

Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter to me where you're waking up tomorrow
Daddy, you're just on my mind

I am not asking you to say words like yes and no
Please understand me, I got no place for you to go
I'm just breathing to myself pretending not that I don't know
Daddy, you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know, I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind
