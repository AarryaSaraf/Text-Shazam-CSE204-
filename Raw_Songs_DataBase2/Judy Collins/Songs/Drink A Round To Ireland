Father was a singing man, most of what he sang
Had to do with Ireland, the place from where he came
Ireland of his childhood, Ireland of his spring
To return to Ireland was his dream

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ, who died for Irishmen

I guess he left his dreams to me after he was gone
And there were many years to come when I sang my father's song
And so I came to Ireland, here I live today
Lately I've been wondering why I stay

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ who died for Irishmen

Dad, I think you're fortunate your dreams did not come true
I know that it would break your heart to see the things we do
If you could see the murder here, if you could feel the pain
To see the way we live would bring you shame

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ who died for Irishmen

Drink a round to Ireland boys, I'm home again
Drink a round to Jesus Christ, who died for Irishmen
