Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where are our dear fathers?
Oh, where are our dear fathers?
Across the valley working
Day is breaking in my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where are our dear sisters?
Oh, where are our dear sisters?
They have gone to heaven shouting
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where is my dear Savior?
Oh, where is my dear Savior?
He is in my heart forever
Day is breaking in my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul
