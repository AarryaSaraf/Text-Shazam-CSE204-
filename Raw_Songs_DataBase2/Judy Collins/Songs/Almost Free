Last night you pushed me a little too far
I was not coming back when I was left in the car
There was a time about an hour or two
When I was feeling so free from you

Pick up a bottle and drove to the heights
I packed on the ridge and looked at the light
The engine was off and the radio on
And the singer sang and I sang along

I was almost free
There are most poison in you and me
I was almost free
On new life ahead of me
Almost free

The sun rise rising over the will
The bottle's empty and so is the feel
This car knows that it's the wrong thing to do
But it's driving me home to you

Maybe I'm too much in love to be strong
Maybe there's one way to be gone
A few more pills a little more wine
And I can get very hard to find

And I feel almost free
There are most tears in you and me
I feel almost free
On new life ahead of me

Sun rise rising over the will
The bottle's empty and so is the feel
A few more pills a little more wine
I can get very hard to find

And I feel almost free
There are most tears in you and me
I feel almost free
On new life ahead of me
Almost free
