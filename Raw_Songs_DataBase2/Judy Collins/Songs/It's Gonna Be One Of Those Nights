there are nights made out of magic
Magic nights when dreams come true
Nights like that can fall to anybody
Even me and you

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Darling, tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights

So kill the lights and light the candles
And turn your favorite station on
Sometime tonight no matter what they're playing
They're gonna be playing our song

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights

It's gonna be one of those nights of magic midnight blue
And everybody is allowed a few

I think we're gonna have one tonight
We're gonna have one of those nights
One of those star-spangled nights
We're gonna have one of those times
One of those times of our lives
Darling, tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see
It's gonna be one of those nights...

One of those times of our lives
Tonight in this world
There's gonna be just you and me
We're gonna be falling in love
Darling, just you wait and see...

One of those times of our lives...
