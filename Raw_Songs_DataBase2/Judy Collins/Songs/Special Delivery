I got two kinds of lovers
One on each coast
All those miles don't mean a thing
And I don't mean to boast
One is my music man
One is the sun
One is my ocean

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
Special delivery
Delivers me
Deliver me

Most of us believe in what we cannot see
But there's more to living than photography
All the threads that link us eternally
Think of electricity

I lose my gravity
I feel my liberty coming home
With your special delivery

Anytime the ordinary brings me down
Just the thought of you
So extraordinary
Brings me round

It's all done with mirrors in the carnival show
Telepathy's a hoax, at least they tell us so
When I hear you call from inside me
I know I can be your radio

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
When your special delivery
Delivers me

Oh I love my music man
I love the sun
I love my ocean

I get to quivering
I get to shivering in my knees
With your special delivery
Deliver me

Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery
Deliver me
Special delivery
Special delivery
