And the little one in my arms will sleep
Every rising of the moon makes the years grow late
And the love in our hearts will keep

There are friends I will make and bonds I will break
As the seasons roll by and we build our own sky
In my heart I will wait by the stony gate
And the little one in my arms will sleep

And the stars in your sky are the stars in mine
And both prisoners of this life are we
Through the same troubled waters we carry our time
You and the convicts and me

There's a good thing to know on the outside or in
To answer not where but just who I am
Because the stars in your sky are the stars in mine
And both prisoners of this life are we

The hills that you know will remain for you
And the little willow green will stand firm
The flowers that we planted through the seasons past
Will all bloom on the day you return

To a baby at play all a mother can say
He'll return on the wind to our hearts and till then
I will sit and I'll wait by the stony gate
And the little one 'neath the trees will dance

And the little one in my arms will sleep
Every rising of the moon makes the years grow late
