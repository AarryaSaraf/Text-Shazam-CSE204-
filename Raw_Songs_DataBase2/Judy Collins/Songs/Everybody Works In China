Nothin' comes easy in the land of the free
I leave my name and my number with the agency
They don't hurry gettin' back to me
So I sleep all day and I watch TV
The sun is settin' but I still in my bed
Takin' something for my achin' head
I used to run just to get out the lead
But now I just change the channels instead

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes

All this hangin' round makes me feel like a fool
Sometimes I dream I'm 18 and I'm back in school
Jokin' around and fallin' in love
Nothing more to be thinkin' of

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yeah

So if I could
I'd take my money and I'd take my guy
Hop on a plane, and fly up in the sky
Sit by the window, watch the world go by
Never worry at all
I'd just be havin' a ball

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yeah

Everybody works in China
From the old man down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes

Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody works in China
Everybody
Oh yeah

Everybody works in China
From the old man right down to the minor
Everybody works in China
Oh yes, oh yes...
