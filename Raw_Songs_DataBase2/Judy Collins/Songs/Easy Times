Easy times come hard for me
And oh, my darling
Time to dream again
That you are coming home

Happy times I've had with you
Do you know, my darling?
Will there ever be a time?
We're not alone

I thought you'd like to know
The willow's turning green
I was down along the railroad tracks today
The winter seems so long

I was here and you were gone
It seems that was as long as I remember

Tell me how you spend your time there
Here there's nothing much to do
And the nights they seem to last forever
But the river's bright with summer

And the trains are going somewhere
But they won't be stopping here to bring you home
Cause I know there's nowhere you can go
