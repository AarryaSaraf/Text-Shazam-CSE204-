I know I got a long journey
Sing Hallelujah
Better get started early
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Last night I heard my Lord a-callin'
Sing Hallelujah
"Sinner, better quit your stallin'"
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Goin' down to the river Jordan
Sing Hallelujah
The boat to Heaven is the one I'm boardin'
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

I know I got a long journey
Sing Hallelujah
I better get started early
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along
