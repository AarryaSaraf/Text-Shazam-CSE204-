I watched the feather river glide
Over shinin' golden sand
Struck the silver ribbon wide
Held a million in my hand
But besides the lookin' for
The finding's always tame
And there's nothin' drives a gambler
Like the lovin' of the game

All my life I've searched around
Travelin' hard from town to town
But I never really found
Anything to tie me down
Still I would not trade my time
For a solid diamond claim
No, I would not trade a fortune
For the lovin' of the game

So long Darlin' don't you cry
I hope that things turn out for you
All these good times goin' by
Got to get ourselves a few
Where I'm going has no end
What I'm seeking has no name
Oh the treasure's not for takin
It's the lovin' of the game
The lovin' of the game
