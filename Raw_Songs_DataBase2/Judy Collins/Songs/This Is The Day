I used to think that some other time
Past or future would be sublime
Maybe as the empress in a crimson robe
In the Ming Dynasty
Or as the captain of a star space probe
To a distant galaxy
In the year 2003
But then one day watching the snow
Every flake distinct as a song
Here for an instant
Here then gone
I learned something
I had known all along

This is the present I bought myself today
Wrapped in paper the color of sky
Oh what a miracle, oh what a buy
Today, today, today what will unfold?

This present set in its box of gold today
Yesterday may have been fair or fine
Nothing I do now can change it
Tomorrow may not ever come
But this day is mine
This is the present I bought just for today
I took today off the shelf
Polished it up
Gave it a spin
Knew it would invite me in today

This is the present I'll never give away
Making a snowflake design
In the rain or in the sunshine
Today, today, today this present is mine
