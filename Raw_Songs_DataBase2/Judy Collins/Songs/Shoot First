The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he has girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him

Go get your guns, it's time to play
Let's hurry up, don't waste the day
Out in the park we'll stage a fight
Just like on the TV

You play the one who has to die
I'll shoot the gun and you will cry
You will fall down and I will run
Just like on the TV

My daddy has a gun for real
He says he'll teach me to use it
I'm gonna have my own someday
Just like on the TV

My daddy told me what to do
If anybody bothers you
He says the law is on our side
Just like on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

My older brother has his own
It's got a handle made of bone
He carries it all over town
Just like on the TV

My daddy gave my mama one
Genuine real pearl handled gun
She says she gonna have some fun
Just like on the TV

Did you see who got shot last night?
I stayed up to watch him
They rushed him off to surgery
Right there on the TV

Gosh, I hope they catch the guy
I think they ought to shoot him
But if they bring him in alive
He'll be on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

I've got to go, it's getting late
I wish I had a real gun
Then I would never be afraid
Like some guys on TV

I'd never use my gun on you
You'd never have to worry
You'd be the good guy on my side
Just like on the TV

I think when I grow up someday
I'm gonna be a Green Beret
I saw them sailing off to war
Last night on the TV

My daddy says it's not a game
We've got to play to win it
He says I'll have to learn to fight
Just like on the TV

You've gotta shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

Shoot first, shoot first
You've gotta shoot first and ask your questions later
Shoot first, you've gotta shoot first
Shoot first, you gotta get them before they get you

"Land of song", said the warrior bard
Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword at least thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee
