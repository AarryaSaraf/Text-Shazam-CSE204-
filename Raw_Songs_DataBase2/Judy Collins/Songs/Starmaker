Here, as I watch the ships go by
I'm rooted to my shore
And I keep asking myself why
And if there's more on the other side

Here, as I see the friends I thought I'd made
A little bit crazed, and knowing now
We've outgrown one another

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Now when I see the things I want
I can take the things I see
But I keep asking myself why
And if there ain't just a little bit more to me

For here, when there's time to count the cost
I keep measuring what I've lost
And wondering if you knew
It would all wind up with you

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Here, as I watch the time go by
How I'd like to sail away
Leaving all my past behind
But I know I'd only last for a couple of days

For here stands everything I thought I made
It's the only life I've known
And I can't even call it my own
I've got no home, I belong to you

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

Starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now

My starmaker
Dream breaker
Soul taker
We're happy now
