She's asks the operator
For a long-distance line
And now she's estimating
Tokyo time
He should be rising
She should be asleep
Sweet music she hears
Those telephone beeps

It's been a week now
Since he left home
Saying, "I'm sorry
But I have to go
It won't be long
And I'll bring you back home
A yellow kimono"

She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time

A glass in her hand
And the sound turned down low
She watches him talking
On a late TV show
It's been a rough day now
And she's missing him so
And that yellow kimono

She can't understand it
Why there's no reply
So she asks the operator
To try one more time
A million thoughts
Are going 'round in her mind
Those Geisha girls
And that hot sake wine

She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She wakes in the morning
With the kids 'round the bed
"Hey look, mommy, mommy
What daddy has sent"
She opens the parcel
Containing no note
Just a yellow kimono

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time

She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm trying to connect you now")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("Do you want to hold the line?")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
("I'm sorry, there's no reply")
She's waiting on Tokyo time
