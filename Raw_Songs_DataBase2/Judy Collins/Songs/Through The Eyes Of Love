Please don't let this feeling end
It's everything I am
Everything I want to be
Finding out what's mine now
Finding out what's true
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

Now I can take the time
I can see my life
And it comes up shining
Reaching out to touch you
I can feel so much
You seem all so new
Looking through the eyes of love

Now I do believe
That even in the storm
We'll find some light
Knowing you're beside me
I'm all right

Please don't let this feeling end
It might not come again
And I want to remember
How it feels to hold you
How I feel so much
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love

How it feels to hold you
How I feel so much
Since I found you
Looking through the eyes of love
