Tear down the walls
Listen to freedom ringin' out
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the church bells ringin' out?

Give every man the chance to take his brother's hand
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

The music's everywhere when every man is free
The music's in the air that lights the road to liberty

Tear down the walls
One world in harmony
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the melody?

Hear every man sing it over the land
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

The music's everywhere when every man is free
The music's in the air that lights the road to liberty

Listen to freedom ringin' out
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the church bells singin' out?

Let every man sing it over the land
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
