So early, early in the spring 
I shipped on board to serve my king 
I left my dearest dear behind 
She oft' times swore her heart was mine

My love she takes me by the hand 
"If ever I marry, you'll be the man" 
A thousand vows so long and sweet 
Sayin' "we'll be married when next we meet" 

And all the time I sailed the seas 
I could not find one moment's ease 
In thinkin of my dearest dear 
And never a word from her could I hear 

At last we sailed into Glasgow town 
I strode the streets both up and down 
Inquiring for my dearest dear 
And never a word from her could I hear 

I went straightway to her father's hall 
And loudly for my love did call 
"My daughter's married, she's a rich man's wife 
She's wed to another, much better for life" 

If the girl is married that I adore 
I'm sure I'll stay on land no more 
I'll sail the sea till the day I die 
I'll break the waves rollin' mountains high
