It isn't nice to block the doorway
It isn't nice to go to jail
There are nicer ways to do it
But the nice ways always fail

It isn't nice, it isn't nice
You told us once, you told us twice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

It isn't nice to block the doorway
Or to sleep in on the floor
Or to shout our cry of freedom
In the hotel or the store

It isn't nice, it isn't nice
You told us once, you told us twice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

Yeah, we tried negotiations
And the token picket line
Mr. Charlie didn't see us
And he might as well be blind

When you deal with men of ice
You can't deal with ways so nice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

They murdered boys in Mississippi
They shot Medgar in the back
Did you say that wasn't proper?
Did you stand out on the track?

You were quiet just like mice
Now you say that we're not nice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
Sing it out, we don't mind, no, no, no

It isn't nice to block the doorway
It isn't nice to go to jail
There are nicer ways to do it
But the nice ways always fail

It isn't nice, isn't nice
Told us once, you told us twice
Well, thank you, buddy, for your advice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no
We don't mind
