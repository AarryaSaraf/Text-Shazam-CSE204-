O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Will you stay it for a while
I think I see my mother coming
Ridin' over yonder stile
Mother, did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
For to save my body from the cold clay ground
My neck from the gallows tree
I didn't bring you gold
Or silver to pay your fee
But I have come to see you hang
On the gallows tree

O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Will you stay it for a while
I think I see my father comin'
Over yonder stile
Father, did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
Or have you come to see me hang
On the gallows tree
I didn't bring ya gold
Or silver to pay your fee
Your mother and I have come today
To see you on the gallows tree

O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Once more for a while
I think I see my darlin' comin'
Over yonder stile
Darlin', did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
For to save my body from the cold clay ground
My neck from the gallows tree

I brought ya gold
And silver to pay your fee
I did not come to see you hang
On the gallows tree

Oh, the prickilie bush,
It pricks my heart full sore
But now that I'm out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it any more
