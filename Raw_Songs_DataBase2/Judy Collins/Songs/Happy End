You'll always love me
So why'd you leave me
You can't convince me
That you don't miss me
You'll be coming back
You're running back

It can't be over
You know you need me
It's not the ending
I saw the movie
And the girl comes back
Comes running back

To happy ending's
Just a minor bending
A little pretense
My little defense
It's a happy end, a happy end
A motion picture, a great elixir
A slight illusion, a bit of magic
A little romance to tide me over

The day is over
The moon is rising
Bright yellow disc
On a purple horizon
And the boy got the girl
And the good guys won
They rode into the sun

To happy ending's
Just a minor bending
A little pretense
My little defense
It's a happy end, a happy end
A motion picture, a great elixir
A slight illusion, a bit of magic
A little romance to tide me over

I never loved you
I only used you
And though you've left me
It doesn't phase me
You'll be coming back
You're running back
