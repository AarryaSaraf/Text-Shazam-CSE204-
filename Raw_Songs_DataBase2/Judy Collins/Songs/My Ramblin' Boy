Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

He a friend and a pal always
He stuck by me in the hard old days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled 'round in the rain and snow

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

In Tulsa town we chanced to straight
We thought we'd try to work one day
The boss said he had room for one
Says, "My old pal, we'd rather bum"

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

Late one night in a jungle camp
The weather it was cold and damp
He got the chills and he got 'em bad
They took the only friend I had

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

He left me here to ramble on
My ramblin' pal he's is dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I'll bet you a dollar he's ramblin' there

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
