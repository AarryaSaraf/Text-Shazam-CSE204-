If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the waters
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd lie in my bed once again

There is beauty in the silver singin' river
There is beauty in the sunrise in the skies
None of these and nothing else can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd sleep in my bed once again
