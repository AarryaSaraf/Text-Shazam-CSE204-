See her how she flies
Golden sails across the sky
Close enough to touch
But careful if you try
Though she looks as warm as gold

The moon's a harsh mistress
The moon can be so cold

Once the sun did shine
Good lord, it felt so fine
The moon a phantom rose
Though with the mountains and the pine
Then the darkness fell

The moon's a harsh mistress
It's hard to love her well

I fell out of her eyes
Fell out of her heart
Fell down on my face
I tripped and missed my star
Fell and fell alone

The moon's a harsh mistress
The sky is made of stone
The moon's a harsh mistress
She's hard to call your own
