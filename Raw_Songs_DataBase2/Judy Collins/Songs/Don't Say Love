Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love

Oh babe, I'm doin' all I can
To keep my heart from bein' broken
Makin' these long range plans
And not a word has yet been spoken
We're takin' the long way around it
You say you want me and I don't doubt it
But honey, I've lost at love before
Ain't tryin' to rush, but I gotta know

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love

Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love

Don't say you love me if you're not for certain
'Cause I don't wanna be the one left hurtin'
Don't say you love me 'til you think it over
You gotta make sure you're right
And I just might wait for one more night

Don't say love if you don't mean it
Don't take my heart if you don't need it
If there's one chance in a million you're not sure
Oh no
Then don't say love if you don't feel it
'Cause I'm fool enough to believe it
But if you do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say
Do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say
Do, I want you too
And if you don't, then don't say love
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
Don't say love (Don't say love)
Oh no (Oh no)
