Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Spanish is the loving tongue
Soft as music, light as spray
T'was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her loved words over
Mostly when Im all alone!
Mi amor, Mi corazon
Haven't seen her since that night
I cant cross the line you know
Wanted for a gambling fight
Like as not its better so
Still I've always kind of missed her
Since that last sad night I kissed her
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Broke her heart, lost my own
Adios, Mi corazon
Adios, Mi corazon.
