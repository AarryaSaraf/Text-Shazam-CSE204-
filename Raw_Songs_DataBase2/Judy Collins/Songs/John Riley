A fair young maid was in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
He said fair maid, will you marry me?
And this answer was her reply

Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
For I've a love and he sails the sea
And though he's been gone for seven years
Still he will return to me

Well, what if he's in some battle slain
Or if he's been drowned in the deep salt sea
Or if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

If he's in some battle slain
Then I shall die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
Still I'm true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they live across the sea

He picked her up in his arms so strong
And kisses he gave her one two three
Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley

Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley
