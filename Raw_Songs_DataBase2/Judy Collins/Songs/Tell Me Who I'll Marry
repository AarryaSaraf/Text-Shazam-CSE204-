Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a builder come to woo you
No one can build a house like he can
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his houses

I would wed my builder
But I'm sorry for my handsome weaver
I would wed my builder but
I'm sorry for my handsome weaver

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a weaver come to woo you
Weaving a garland with his fingers
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his weaving

I would wed my weaver
But I'm sorry for my handsome turner
I would wed my weaver but
I'm sorry for my handsome turner

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a turner come to woo you
All round his length the sparks are showering
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his capstan

I would wed my turner
But I have someone else to give my heart to
I would wed my turner but
I've someone else to give my heart to

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
