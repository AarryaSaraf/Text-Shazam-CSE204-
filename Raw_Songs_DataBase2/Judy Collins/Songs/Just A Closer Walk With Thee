Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to me
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

I am weak, but Thou art strong
Jesus, keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk
Let me walk close to Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to me
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be

Through this world of toil and snares
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee

Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to me
Let it be, oh Lord, let it be
Just a closer walk with Thee
