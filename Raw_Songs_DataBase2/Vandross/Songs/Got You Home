I Am Glad That You Accepted
My Offer To You When I Said, Excuse Me Miss? What's Your Name?
That Was The Spark That Lit The Flame
You Won't Be Regrettin It
I Promise You'd Be Satisfied
So Relax, Cause Everything Gonna Be Alright


Girl I'm Glad I Got You Tonite Nite Nite Nite
Finally We All Alone Tonite Nite Nite Nite
I'm Gonna Turn Down The Lights I'll Give You What You Like, Girl I'm Glad That I Got You Home, Now That I Got You Home Tonite

First Let Me Take Your Coat Off
And Let Me Show You All Around And If You Need Something I Think You Ought To Get It Now
We'll Be Busy Doing Whatever's Cool
And I Don't Want Interupptions Between Me And You



I Can't Imagine Being In Another Place
Except With You Face To Face
I Can't Imagine Being In Another Place
Expect With You Face To Face

Cause I've Been Waiting
So Long For This Moment To Come
And Now Your Here
In My Arms
