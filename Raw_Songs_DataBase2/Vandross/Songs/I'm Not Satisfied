When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

I start to walk and call you up
And you're still on the line
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

Don't give me like
When it's love I need
When I need your warmth
Don't leave me out to freeze
Expecting to wake up to laughter
And find that you've cried
Isn't that enough
Not to be satisfied

When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied

I wait around
For you to come
But you always seem
To keep me hangin' on
You don't come
You don't call
Sometimes I think
You don't care for me at all

When I'm in the mood for love
And I find that you're not there
It hurts my pride
And I'm not satisfied
No, not not, not at all, no

I walk around with my head hung low
I can't get love, no
No satisfaction, no, baby

I walk around with my head hung low
I can't get love, no
No satisfaction, no, baby

Everytime that I'm with you
I'm in heaven, yes I am, yes I am
Sometimes when I call you
I can't find you nowhere, nowhere
Nowhere, nowhere, nowhere, nowhere

Would you be there
So that I can love you, baby
Love you, baby
