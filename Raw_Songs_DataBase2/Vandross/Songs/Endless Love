My love, there's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love, you're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I (and I)
I want to share all my love with you (hey you)
No one else will do, you know it
And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes, you will always be my endless love

Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever (forever)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love (and love)
I'll be a fool for you
(Honey I'm sure)
I'm sure you know I don't mind
(Oh you know I don't mind, baby baby baby baby)
'Cuz baby you, you mean the world to me
Oh I know I found in you my endless love

Oh and love, I'll be that fool for you (for you baby)
I'm sure (I'm so sure)
That you know I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't mind)
And yes, you'll be the only one
'Cuz no one, no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you

My love
My love, my love
My, my, my
My endless love
