It doesn't take much for me to know when a woman's lonely
Especially when I'm alone myself
If there's anyone out there that needs love like I need love
Just hold on and I'll be there

(When you call on me, babe) When you call on me
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
When you call on me (Yeah...)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'

If ever I find that someone special for me
I will do all that I can to keep her in my life
Now I lay me down to sleep and hope that heaven hears my heart
Send me someone right now

(When you call on me, babe) When you call on me (Hey...)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
(Hey, hey) When you call on me (Call on me)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'

When you call on me (Me)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin')
When you call on me (Yeah...hey...)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'
(I'll come runnin' to you, baby)

Oh, I promise when you fall asleep
At night I will be there
To cuddle you in love
And show you that I care

It doesn't take much for me to know when a woman's lonely
Especially when I'm alone myself
If there's anyone out there who needs love like I need love
Just hold on and I'll be right there

(When you call on me, babe) When you call on me
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (Runnin) to you (To you)
When you call on me (Baby)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' (To ya), runnin'

When you call on me (When you call on me)
Baby, that's when I'll come (I'll come)
runnin' (I'll come), runnin' (I'll come runnin')
When you call on me (When you call on me)
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin' (Whenever you need)

When you call on me (Oh...oh...)
Baby, that's when (When) I'll come
(I'll come runnin, runnin') runnin' to you (To you, babe)
When you call on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, runnin')
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin' (Runnin')

When you call on me
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin' to you
When you call on me
Baby, that's when I'll come runnin', runnin'

When you call on me
