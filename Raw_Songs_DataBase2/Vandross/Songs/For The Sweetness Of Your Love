What's your name
Girl, what's your number
I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw ya
And I couldn't get you off my mind, Hey Hey
You reminded me of candy
So you be my Mary Jane
And I'll be your Sugar Daddy
And we can make sweet love all the time
Ooh girl


I'd travel to the farthest star
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
You're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Much sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar
(Is the sweetness of your love)
Yeah, talkin' 'bout
And my rocket would only stop
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well, Well (Well, Well) Hey
All I ever think about
(Is the sweetness of your love)
What ya say
(Say Yeah Yeah) Yeah Yeah

You call for it, I'll deliver
I'll bring you anything
So fast it'll make you shiver
Whatever it is, from A to Z, Hey Hey
Let me prove that I can love ya
I'll do a dance for you
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you
Of whomever you dream, I wanna be




I'd take my money out the bank
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd buy you a great big diamond ring
(For the sweetness of your love)
'Cause Ooo baby, I'd do anything
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
'Cause you're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

And I'd go 10 rounds with Sugar Ray
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd eat my Wheaties everday
(For the sweetness of your love)
BANG! ZOOM! And he would fly away
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well Well Yeah Yeah

You could be lost in danger with a stranger
Caught up in mystery
A one night insanity, girl
And quite an emotional tragedy it would be
Then I'd come running just to save you
I'd be your hero guy
In a flash, in a minute I'd be there in no time
And you'd be forever loving me



Sweet, sweet (Sweet, sweet)
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd say Ooo wee
(Ooo wee, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd be what you want me to be
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
'Cause you're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

Say Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd go anywhere
(Anywhere, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd call you up when I got there
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Yeah Yeah Yeah
(Sweet, sweet for the sweetness of your love)
Ooo wee (Ooo wee, for the sweetness of your love)

I'd be what you want me to be
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well, Well (Well, Well)
Say Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)
(For the sweetness of your love)
I'd follow you anywhere
(Anywhere, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd call you up when I got there
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
(Sweet, Sweet, for the sweetness of your love)
(Ooo wee for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd even wrestle Mister T
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)
