In your arms
In your arms, yeah

I dream enough to know
The way true love should feel
I'm strong enough to show you
The heart can always heal

It shouldn't be so hard
To let our love just live
It's really all we have
The love we need to give

I've been dreaming
I don't wanna be awake
I don't wanna see the day
I just want the night to stay

I want the night to stay
And last a little longer
So we can always be
In love you see

I want the night to stay
In your arms
In your arms, yeah

Tomorrow's gonna come
And chase tonight away
And leave me sitting right here
To cry the day away

I've been hoping
That tomorrow won't rush in
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want the night to end

I want the night to stay
And last a little longer
So we can always be
In love you see
I want the night to stay

Forever, together
Forever, together
Forever, together
Forever, together

In your arms, yeah
All night
Tonight
Good night
I want the night to stay
I want the night to stay

I want the night to
I'll stay right here in your arms
Right here in your arms
I want the night to stay, stay

I'll stay, oh yeah, oh yeah
I wanna stay
Tonight, tonight
I wanna stay
I'll stay
