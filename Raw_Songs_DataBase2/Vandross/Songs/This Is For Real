If I wanted to
I'd have anything
I could ever need
Anything, indeed

But if I can't have you
I'd be lost within
And everything else, baby
Would really not be worth having

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real

If I had a little time
I'd change what I am
But without you baby
I don't even give a damn

Cause what I am won't change
Until you change it to
Anything you want it to be
I'm putting my trust in you

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
Real

I thought it out the other day
And came to the conclusion
That I wouldn't last a minute without you, baby
You did it to me, baby
When you walked out on me
Now I've got to make you understand
That I wont be bad anymore

Honey, this is for real
Everything that I'm saying
Ever word that I'm saying
Is the thought of a brand new man
I've gotta have you back
So that I can make you see
That I'm not fooling around
This is a brand new me

I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
This is how I feel
So you, you've got to understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
You've got to understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real
