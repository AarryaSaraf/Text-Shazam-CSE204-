I am a sunshine person
But it's been rainin'
I wish the clouds would go
So the sun can restore the light

I've cried a thousand tears or more
Maybe a million
But of one thing I'm very sure
I'm gonna be alright

So if the sun would come
And shine on my love
I'd be the happiest man
In the world

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love
Ooo, follow my love
Ooo, my love

I am a sunshine person
You are my lady
You're everything I live for
Sunshine and love
If I have peace of mind
I'm thinking of you
When I'm thinking of sunshine and love
That's all I need to do

So when the sun comes down to
Shine on my love
I'm in a world
That keeps me satisfied

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love

Ooo, follow my love
Ooo, my love
My love, my love, my love, my love
My love
My my my my my my...

I never knew that the sunrise
Could make me smile
And in a moment the laughter
Would follow the tears
I never dreamed that the sunshine
Could send good things from above
I need the warmth of the sunlight
To follow my love
