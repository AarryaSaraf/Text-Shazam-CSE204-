 - How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before
How do I tell her
I don't wanna be here anymore
Nothing she did
I just don't feel the way I did before

I'm doing all I can to try and understand
Why my feelings faded away
She's been nothin' but good to me
I don't wanna hurt her but I must be free
I can't stay in this love
How do I say goodbye



She pretends she can not see
The love is gone from me
She carries on as if it is what it was before
But I don't love her anymore
I have to let her know
That I must let her go
I can't stay in this life
How do I say goodbye



Oh, I don't know what to do about it
Gotta tell her, gotta tell her, gotta tell her
Oh, there's no way to go around it
I've got to tell her now
But I don't know how

Listen, listen baby
Listen closely baby
I just gotta tell you
All the love we once had is through

Listen, listen baby
Listen closely baby
I don't wanna be with you anymore
I can't stay, I can't stay
