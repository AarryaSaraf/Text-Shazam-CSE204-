(Talk about love, talk about love)
(Talk about love, talk about love)
Love, love, love
(Talk about love, talk about love)
Alright, love, love, love
(Talk about love, talk about love)

One day I'll always remember
Was when you walked into my life
It was a very special night
When we danced so close

So tender, it gave my heart
The second chance that I'd been waiting for

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey
Come on, open the door

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)

Every time that we kiss
I'm reminded it's you I miss
I just love it when we love like this
I can tell you that

Please forgive me if I pout
But my world would turn inside out
If on leaving me, you insist
Let me tell you that

I start to hold you but you pull back
Not much just a little, I can't control you
When you get so caught up in the middle
First you say yes, then you say no

Said, you're gonna stay
Now you're gonna go
You know I'll tell you, honey
But I think you already know

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)

I can you this, anytime you go
I really miss you, nothing to do
Tired of my friends, won't you come back
And love me again, so I can tell you
That you've got me forever girl to love

Our love is falling, all kinds of pressure
Has temptation calling, it gives me fever
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you
I'm gonna stay 'til the last day

Worry no more, what is love for
I hear love knocking, honey
Come on, open the door

You know you've got me to love
I can tell you that
If you ever should need some love
You just call me back

I've been loving you for the start
Let me tell you that
And I'll keep loving you from my heart
Sure can tell you that you've got so much
(To love)
