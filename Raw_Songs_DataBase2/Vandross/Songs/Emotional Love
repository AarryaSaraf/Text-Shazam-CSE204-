I think love should be heaven sent
I can't love you just to pay your rent

Heart to heart is the way it should be
You've got to love with devotion to emotion
Don't hold back, talk to me, let it go
Cry on my shoulder, honey, don't you know

If it's going to be an
(Emotional love)
Then it's got to start with a
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny
(I'm an emotional guy)
And I searched the world for a
(Emotional girl)

Happy to be the love of your life
'Cause some guys want ya for only one night

Can't explain all this love that I feel
Sometimes my mind is a ball of confusion
Love will fix it eventually
Don't tell your friends about it, come to me

If it's going to be
(Emotional love)
Then it's got to start with an
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny
(I'm an emotional guy)
So I searched the world for a
(Emotional girl)
Yes, I do

I like emotional
(Love)
I love emotional
(Love)

Don't hold on
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

Can't explain all this love that I feel
Sometimes my mind is a ball of confusion
Love will fix it eventually
Don't tell your friends about it, come to me

If it's going to be
(Emotional love)
Then it's got to start with an
(Emotional heart)
No, I can't deny
(I'm an emotional guy)
So I searched the world for a
(Emotional girl)

Come down around
(Loves to be emotional)
If I say one thing about
(Got to be emotional)
Do you really love me but?
(Loves to be emotional)
Now I don't want to think about
(Got to be emotional)
And the one who can deny it
(Loves to be emotional)
