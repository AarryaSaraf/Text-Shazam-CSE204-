One day I was cryin'

Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget how to love

Yes, I am in love
I can love, I can love
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget how to love

To love, they say, they say
Once you know how you just never forget
Once you know how you just never forget
