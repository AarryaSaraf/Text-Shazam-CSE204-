Hero, Hero

Someone above keeps sendin' us love
He wants us to love each other
You see, the more we give, the better we live
Lets help the world of the future

We're singin', oh happy day
This life is for us
Life without love is a zero
(Come on, sing it together!)
Oh happy day, I heard someone say
inside every heart is a hero
You're a hero

If you're a friend to every man,
you're that much closer to Heaven
Heaven knows the love we share, God wants us to care
Think of the world we'll be getting

Keep singing, oh happy day
This world is for us, 
The world without love is a zero
(There ain't nothin' to it!)
Oh happy day, give love to someone
and you'll have the heart of a hero
You're a hero

Sometimes a hero doesn't know he's a hero
and that's the beauty of sharing love
And it doesn't take superman,
just plain ordinary people,
trying to give someone a hand, if they can
TOGETHER

Oh happy day, thank GOD for his love
cuz life with no love is a zero
(Come on, sing it together!)
Oh happy day, give love to someone
and you'll have the heart of a hero
(oh yes you will!)

Oh happy day, life is for us
cuz life without love is a zero
(I wanna hear everybody say)
Oh happy day, I've heard someone say
that inside every heart is a hero
You're a hero
Say it! Hero
