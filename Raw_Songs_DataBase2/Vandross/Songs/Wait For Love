Knowing love the way I do
I can say for certain that it's true
There's a chance for me and you.
I surely feel like the time is near
The picture in my mind is very clear
I think love has brought us here

I remember not too long ago
I was just a lonely person
With a lonely heart, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be,
Be a chance


For me to get the love
That I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love
And you're gonna to get the chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love oh, my

When you take the chance on love you'll see
It's not a waste of time if you truly believe
The impossible can be
So hold on tight if you think you're right
Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see
You gave up too easily

Now I remember spending all my time
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine, yeah
And I was hoping there could one day be, be a chance, whoa



I never stopped believing there could one day be, be a chance

For me to get the love that I'd been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
Wait for love, and you're going to get your
Chance to love
Wait for love, wait for love
And you'll get the love that you've been missing
Sometimes love takes a long time
But wait for love
And you're going to get your chance to love
