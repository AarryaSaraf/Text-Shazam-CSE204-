How am I gonna get along
After loving you for so long?
How am I gonna find good times when you're gone?
How am I gonna fill
This emptiness that sure enough
Will leave me hungry for your love?


I'll get along fine without you, baby
Oh, yes, I will get along somehow
I've made up my mind
To try and keep trying and trying
I guess I'll do fine
I guess I'll be alright

Seems I should be sad
But somehow separating ain't that bad
I'd love for you to see me cry
But the tears won't come to my eyes
I'm really glad
That we can break up peacefully
You'll be glad to know. Don't you worry, 'cause



Sometimes it seems kind of strange
To call your name
And then look around and you're not there
Everything is fine
'Cause I've made up my mind to get along twice as well
