Album: DanceWithMyFather

// If I Didn't Know Better //

I think sometimes I can read your mind
When you make things up I can tell you lie 
I see the things that your man can't see
And I wonder what kind of man is he
The one who you say is your lover 
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers
And who is there for you and loves you like no other 
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother
[CHORUS]
If I didn't know better
I'd think that you were mine, you're with me all the time 
If I didn't know better 
I'd swear we're more than friends, you're touching me again 
If I didn't know better 
I'd think we were in love 
Girl, do you wanna tell me something
Oh, oh, oh
I could be wrong about the things you say 
But I don't rub up on my friends that way
You tell me that you've always been a flirt 
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt
But no, you insist it's harmless playin'
It's just a part of who you are, that it's just your nature 
And that it's fine 
You know I'm a friend, it's really nothing
You say that I'm just like a…
That I'm just like a brother
[CHORUS]
My idea of a friend is when you
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun 
But my definition of love is different
You touch and hold each other 
And you only want to be alone clinging to each other 
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are
Well, I know it sounds crazy but…
[CHORUS]

// Think About You //

So close to paradise, but closer than I should be
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly
Promised myself that I wouldn't ever love again
But you make me feel something, my mind's always on you
I was standing in the rain (I thought about you)
I was riding on the train (I thought about you)
Feeling high like I seem to do
Every time I think about you  
Saw two lovers start to kiss (I thought about you)
Had to hold back the tears (I thought about you)
Other girls no more exist
All because I think about you
Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself
I'm trying not to think of you, but a heart does what it wants to do
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you
Bought a pillow for my room (I thought about you)
Heard Alicia sing a tune (I thought about you)
It sends my rocket to the moon
Every time I think about you
Right from this heart of mine (I thought about you)
I wanted you every time (I thought about you)
What I feel is so divine
And it's all because I think about you
But I'm constantly reminded
Reminded that you're only someone who I'd like to know
You don't know me, you're my private fantasy
You're with me, constantly in my mind
Had a lovely day today (I thought about you)
Wasn't hard to get through (I thought about you)
Seems to happen easily
Every time I think about you
Took a walk with myself (I thought about you)
Wish it could've been with you (I thought about you)
But every star in the sky came out for me
And it's all because I think about you

// If It Ain't One Thing... //

I coulda died when I found out
We couldn't live together peacefully
That's when it started and we nearly parted 
Well, I was hoping not to see the day
We started getting in each other's way 
Maybe it's better we don't live together
Things got strange 
My space to chill become half the size
You became someone
I didn't even recognize
What's the matter now 
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta put me down 
What are you complaining about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another   
I got a yacht for a dinner cruise 
The way you treated everyone was rude
I don't believe ya, you're such a diva
I told the waitress we wanted wine
You got upset because the girl was fine
You're complicated, but somehow we make it
I get tired 
From all I have to do to keep you satisfied 
Get no sleep 
You call me in the middle of the night and weep 
What's the matter now  
What are you crying about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta fuss and shout 
What are you screaming about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another 
I guess I can't see the world through your eyes 
Pretty little brown eyes 
Guess I don't understand 
What goes on, goes on, goes on in your mind
What's the matter now 
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta put me down 
What are you fussing about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another
What's the matter now  
What are you talking about 
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's the other 
Why you gotta scream and shout 
What are you complaining about 
If it ain't one thing, it's the other
If it ain't one thing, it's another

// Buy Me A Rose //

He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say…
[CHORUS]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life
Now the days have grown to years of feelin' all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' is wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said, if she said…
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside 
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is the story of you…and me
So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
'Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
And I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight
Do all those little things for the rest of your life

// The Closer I Get To You //

The closer I get to you
The more you make me see
By giving me all you've got (tell me more)
Your love has captured me

Over and over again
I tried to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
But all the while, inside, I knew it was real (Ooh)
The way you make me feel

Lying here next to you
Time just seems to fly
Needing you more and more, more and more (more and more)
Let's give love a try (Let's give love a try)

Sweeter and sweeter love grows
And heaven's there for those
Who fool the tricks of time
With hearts of love will find
True love in a special way

Oh oo oh oo, the closer I get (the closer I get)
Closer I get to you baby
The more you make me see (the more you make me see)
More you make me see
By giving me what you got, ohohoh yeah
Your love captured me

Oh, over and over again
I try to tell myself that we
Could never be more than friends
When all the while inside I knew this was real (got to be real)
Got to be real
The way you make me feel

You know, you know, you know
My baby, my baby, my baby
My love
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)

(Come closer love)
Come a little closer so that we can see
Into the eyes of love
I want to see into those eyes of love
(Come closer, love)
Just a little closer let me speak to you
I want to softly tell you something
Here I am, here's my love, I just want you to...
(Come closer, love)
Come a little closer let me whisper in your ear
Cuz I wanna tell you something
I wanna whisper in your ear so softly...so come closer, love (Come closer, love)
Move on in real close so we can celebrate
The way we feel a bout each other's loving
I wanna tell you words, words of love...

// Lovely Day //

When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something strange without a warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind
[CHORUS]
Then I look at you
And the world is all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day…
…lovely day, lovely day, lovely day…
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When somebody else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
It's gonna be a lovely day (it's gonna be)
It's gonna be today
It's gonna be a lovely day
Today I love the world and I love you
[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]
It's gonna be today
A lovely day today
It's gonna be today
A lovely day today

// Dance With My Father //

Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Then finally make me do just what my mama said

Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
'Cause I'd love, love, love
To dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved?
I know You don't do it usually
But, dear Lord, she's dying
To dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream

// She Saw You //

Why did you tell your girlfriend you were hanging with the boys
She called me last night and I tried to cover for ya
She asked if I liked the flick that we all went out to see
I said, "ooo uh, it was nice"
She said, "Don't you lie to me"
You messed up you shoulda warned me first (she saw you)
I'm sad to tell ya
You shoulda told me 'cause you made it worse (she saw you) unlucky fella
You better take that credit card (she saw you) to Cartier
You better hope with all you got (she saw you)
She feels like forgiving you today
Too bad for you
You were out there trying to be a player, now she's gone, it's true
It's hard to feel that sorry for you
She saw you, now this is the end 
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend
She's convinced you took her heart 
And played with it like a toy
And from what I heard, you just might need you a lawyer
It's too late for feeling bad, you did not respect the girl
You tried to play around
And got caught with your pants down
You can't escape from what you've done (she saw you) your time is up
You're like a deer who's caught up in (she saw you) the headlights of love
You can't be too proud to plead (she saw you) she's gonna make you pay
Forgiveness is what you need (she saw you) she's too mad to let you get away
Looks bad to me
You were busy trying to be a player
Now she's gone, breathe deep
You can't be doing that creep, creep, creep, creep
She saw you, now this is the end 
Saw you kiss the very girl (who's supposed to be) only your friend

// Apologize //

Your love's never been better
So good it's a sin
But it's time for a decision
Is it me or him?
Before you make your mind up, hear me
I just want you to see things clearly
This should be about love, not money
Don't let him try to take you from me
I don't wanna have to apologize
I don't wanna feel I've been penalized
Just 'cause I can drive in a better car 
Live in a bigger house just like a superstar
He says that I can only give you
Material things, but that's not true
You see my heart is rich with love for you
Don't let him make you doubt my love for you
Yeah, baby
I work hard for my money
No one gave it to me
But some fools think the deeper the pocket
The smaller the heart will be, not true
I'm only tryin' to share me with you
Look at all the lovin' we do
Find the meaning in the words I'm sayin'
I'm not just another player playin'
I don't wanna have to apologize (or give a damn)
And I don't appreciate being criticized (for who I am) 
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things
Or take you anyplace
That's just what money brings
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love
'Cause that's what he would do
He thinks since he's a man with nothing
That he's got better love for you
No way 
Tell him now, let him go
Or I can no longer be yours
Tell him how you feel about me
I can't keep standing on the side
Don't let him fill your mind with lies about me
Leave him with his fallacies
I don't care what bull he believes
Tell him that enough is enough
Just don't return a disbeliever
You've always been a willing receiver of my love
I don't think I have to apologize (I work for this)
I don't wanna  feel like I'm penalized (for being rich)
Doesn't bother me where he thinks I stand
I'm bein' my true self
Just doin' what I can
He thinks I won you with materiality
But honey, you know that's not so
And even if he understood me
It's simply time for him to go---so let him go!
I don't wanna change you 
'cause I'm in love with who you are
So I don't wanna apologize for bein' a superstar
Haven't I proved that I'm here for you?
What am I guilty of?
What did or didn't I do?
Maybe I can't be myself with somebody
Who believes such things are true
I'm losing self-respect from trying
I'm losing my desire too---I can't do it
I don't wanna have to apologize (or give a damn) 
I don't wanna feel I've been penalized (for who I am) 
Just 'cause I can buy you a lotta things
Or take you anyplace
That's just what money brings
He wants you to believe that I'm tryin' to buy your love
'Cause that's what he would do

// Hit It Again //

Well by now you know I'm insatiable
'Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah
It's a miracle, you were right inside my head
If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?
It is not against the law, no baby
I slave all through the week 
And I need my release
I work hard so when I stop 
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait
Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it
I hope you understand
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no
If I can't double up
It's like I didn't get enough
Call me greedy if you want, just do it
But it's something that will never change
I don't get no complaints
They know it when they ring my bell
That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait
Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
I declare the point to be 
Once is not enough for me 
Two time lovin' makes me smile
One time love just ain't my style
Repeat the love and I have found
More the second time around
It builds me up I love to love
And if I can't hit it again
It ain't natural  
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait
Hit it again, hit it again, baby 
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby

// Right In The Middle //

If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get the same old stuff
Life can treat you good, then turn as cold as ice
And believe me when I tell you
This thing called love, for sure, is like most things in life
Not all bad, not all good (it's just something that I believe)
Not all cold, not all hot (yeah, I like that)
Not all bitter, not all sweet (sounds all right to me)
So don't miss all the good, waiting for the best, there's still happiness
Right in the middle
Perfect love sounds real nice
But that never seemed to happen with any relationship of mine
It was always up and down, in then out
And after the last goodbye, I still didn't know what it was all about
You get disappointed if it ain't bliss all the time
And you get so annoyed if you can't feel the same every night
Not all bad, not all good (I'm tryin' to tell you that it's)
Not all high, not all low (not all high and not all low)
Not all heaven, not all hell (as far as I can tell)
It's not some prize you win, you don't have a thing to prove, just enjoy the groove
Right in the middle
'Cause I've learned when it comes to love, it's the exact same reality
That's why they say "Que sera, sera"
Which means whatever's gonna be is gonna be
Whatever's gonna be is gonna be…
Not all bad, not all good (I need somebody to understand)
Not all sunshine, not all rain 
(you know that too much of a good thing is really no good)
Not all laughter, not all tears (I'm only trying to tell you)
To let your good times roll, keep your self-control, there's a lotta soul
Right in the middle

// Once Were Lovers //

We shared a life, we shared a heart
But what we united seems to be breaking apart
It's a haunting pain, goes right to the core
Now we're dividing what's mine from what's yours
I'll keep the same old things I had when we met  
And you'll keep what's yours 'cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?
[CHORUS]
We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us
You and I once were lovers
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong
So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong
But I know with time things that start to mend
So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been
Don't worry, I will start all over and then
We will get back the heart that we both created together 
[CHORUS]
Last night I cried but girl you were not here
So it was just a big waste of tears
But then I smiled, I heard your voice in my ear
Tellin' me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning
[CHORUS]

// Lovely Day (Part II) //

What's up my people?
You know
I am your weather man Busta Rhymes
I've come today to give you your weather forcast
you know today looks like one of those beautiful days
you know? to be perfectly honest,
there aint a cloud in the sky
you know this is the kind of weather you take your girl to the beach
lay her down and talk to her
Luther, step to the microphone

When i wake up in the morning love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
something strange without a one in love
That is heavy on my mind
then i look at you
and the world is alright with me
just one look at you
and i know it's gonna be

[Chorus]
a lovely day

[Busta Rhymes]
Huh

I'm watching how my mami watching her do

i've got plenty suggestions on things we can maybe do
especially when we rockin the songs we make babies to
you know the way we do baby
and as we lay i look at you
i sit back and think how today was such a lovely day

(Lovely day, lovely day lovely day come on come on)
It's gonna be a lovely day

and i love everything about it
not a sexy anywhere

// They Said You Needed Me //

Goodbye, so long
Were the last words from you
Seems like you're over
All the goodness we knew
You think that you're strong
You think that you don't
You don't need no one
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends
Just to see how everyone was doin'
And they said you needed me
Said it was something you'd never admit
But it was hard to see you going through it
They said you needed me 
Guess I'll suffer 'til I'm where I belong
I'm under the pressure
But I'll keep being strong
You say that you're strong
You say that you don't need anyone
What in the world are you telling your friends
I get confused every time I see them
They said you needed me
I know the people talk just for the thrill
But the fact of the matter is still
They said you needed me
Take your time, re-invent your mind
You'll feel better, you'll feel stronger
Then decide if I'm in your life
For forever or longer
You think that you're strong
You think that you don't
You don't need no one
Well, I was talkin' to some of your friends
Just to see how everyone was doin'
And they said you needed me
Said it was something you'd never admit
But it was hard to see you going through it
They said you needed me
