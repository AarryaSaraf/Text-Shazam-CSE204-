// Forever, For Always, For Love //

There was a time when I didn't have no one, didn't have no love
Do you remember the love that we once had
Well if I had the chance to love you again
I would make your heart forget I was ever there
If we forget the past
I know this time love will last forever, for always, for love

I'm not coming home anymore, doesn't matter
Well if I had the chance to hold you again
I'd fill your heart with joy and make you remember
I'm the only one for you, yes I would
Let's throw the bad memories out and make this the first day
Forever, for always, for love

I'd be a fool to ever change
If she says she loves me the way I am
I'd be a fool to ever change
If she says she loves the, loves the way I am
It's gonna be starting here, starting now, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, for always
Do it for the ones you love, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Forever, for always, keep it right there, keep it right there
Yeah, for always, for love, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, always, for love, hey hey hey
Forever, for always, yeah yeah yeah
For always, for love, hey hey hey
For love, forever, for always, for love
Forever, for always, for love, hey

// Better Love //

Lately I toss and turn at night
I hold my pillow very tight
Wake up to find the covers on the floor
I can't go on since you 've been gone
Sometimes I don't know what I'm living for
See I don't know what he told you 'bout the better life
His better cars and how he can treat you better
But none of that will keep you warm at night
He'll give you more
But who could have a better love

[Chorus:]
Better love
A better love
A better, better love
Who could love you better
There is no reason
Honey, you should ever worry what I'm doing
While you're gone I'm being true to you
My fire burns for your return
And I'll just dream of you until you do

See I never could replace your love with anyone's
I do believe it's easier said than done
No matter whose promises you dream of
Go search the world
You couldn't find a better love
[Fade]

// She Loves Me Back //

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I did everthing that a guy could do
I couldn't do more than that
I felt so helpless
I thought things would never change
Then I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
One day I said, I wanna talk to you

I wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in my eyes
She took me on a natural high
When I said, I love you girl of mine
And then she said, I love you back
She loves me back

I had a lover
Who did not love me back
I bought her candy canes and dolls and flowers
And I took her to Coney Island
Now, who could do more than that?
It was a problem
Until on that fateful day
I saw my girl walking down on the avenue
She said, I wanna talk to you

She wasn't afraid to cry
Emotion was in here eyes
She took me on a natural high
I said, I love you girl of mine
And then she said, I love you back
She loves me back

I don't thing our love's gonna lose
There ain't no way
I'm taking my time to convince her
That love's her to stay, hey
Love is here to stay because
She loves me back

We weren't afraid to cry
Emotion was in our eyes
She took me on a natural high
I said, I love you girl of mine
And then she said, I love you back
She loves me back
[Fade]

// Once You Know How //

One day I was cryin'
'Cause I thought that
Love was something that would
Never come my way, no way

That's when somebody told me not to worry
They said love would surely one day be my friend
And I would never have to be without it again
And it's because

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget how to love

I'm in love, I'm in love
Yes, I am in love
I can love, I can love
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Don't you know that
Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget how to love

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget

Once you know how, you just never forget how to
It may seem kinda crazy but it's a shown off thing
Been tested and found true
Once you know how, you just never forget how to love

To love, they say, they say
Once you know how you just never forget
Once you know how you just never forget
