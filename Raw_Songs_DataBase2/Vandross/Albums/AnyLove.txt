Album: AnyLove

// I Wonder //

I stood in line at the corner store
And I heard these guys talk about this girl
Hey, who gives them love anytime they want... huh
Then they said your name and how you carry on
Your chain of fools is so long
I thought our love was still on
And so, oh what a fool I've been
I thought I was your man and oh

[Chorus:]
I wonder who's there loving you
No one does you the way I do
I wonder who... who's there loving you
And I really wonder who
(It's been so long)
Since you've called me, yeah
(I thought our love was strong)
Just the way a love should be
(And now that you're gone)
I sit here and I wonder

[Bridge 1:]
I've seen so many guys
Take one look into your eyes
And think they're in paradise

There was less than love in the things that woman said
Now, I wonder who put ideas in her head
I'm still in shock 'cause when I went back there again
She'd changed her lock and said, sorry you can't come in
What a fool I've been... lookout
I thought I was your man and oh ooh

I wonder who's there loving you
No one does you the way I do
I wonder who... who's there loving you
And I really wonder who
(It's been so long)
Since you've called me, yeah
(I thought our love was strong)
Just the way a love should be
(And now that you've gone)
I sit here and wonder

[Bridge 2:]
I've seen so many guys
Take that look into your eyes
And think they're in paradise

[Chorus]

[Fade]

I don't wanna be in love if you don't love me
And I love you so, I betcha that you don't know
And I wonder who...
I wonder, I wonder

And I wonder who thatcha got loving you
And I wonder why you're with some other guy
And I wonder who...
I wonder, I wonder

Don't wanna be a fool for no one, you see
And I want you so, I bet you don't even know
And I wonder who...
I wonder, I wonder

// She Won't Talk To Me //

I was hanging with some friends of mine
We were all having a real good time, yeah
I saw a girl who was so very fine
I started waving my hands, my arms, my head

Got the nerve; found the words to say
But to my surprise she was passing
I mean it was strange 'cause she just walked away
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

Now you're nervous with the fever
Body beat and never quit
I'm in heaven when I see her
Won't you talk some little things?
Hope she talk to me

I can't hear (What cha gonna do?)
You can't sit down like no one all by yourself
(I just wanna talk to you) And nobody else, yeah

I just wanna tell her
She's the girl of my fantasies
How we meet in my dreams every night it seems
And how love can be, I wanna (love you)
I'm gonna be (your love)

It's not everyday we see the one
That your heart's been likely dreaming of
There's that look in her eyes, so I don't know why
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

She pretends she doesn't see me
Leaves me standing in the rain
'Cause I know she wants to meet me
She's just playing silly games

I said girl (What cha gonna do?)
Wanna show you a love that you just gotta see
(I just wanna talk to you) But she won't talk to me

And ooh, I'm telling everyone
I'm not dreaming anymore
'Cause I know she won't talk to me now
And at least she can't say no

And I'm going crazy
Trying to make her notice me
I go up, I get down, I turn all around
She won't talk to me, she won't talk to me

I said (Hey there baby)
I said (Hey there girl)
I said (Hey there baby)
She won't talk to me
She won't talk to me
[Repeat to fade]

// I Know You Want To //

If only I could read your mind
I could heal your broken heart
I could mend you when your falling apart

I wanna love you
I wanna care
But there's not a thing that I can do
Not until you say that you want me there
And that you want me to love you forever
I know it's what you want
Though it's easy to say that you don't

[Chorus:]
I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

No.no no no no love...

I hear your heartbeat
I feel you shiver
And in the stilness of the night
(I can hear the angels saying to me)
She wants to love you
She wants to care
But she's so afarid of a broken heart
(She's afraid to dall0
Will someone be there

We'll I'll pick you up and put you together
I know it; s what you want
Though you constanly say that you don't

[Chorus:]
I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

[Bridge:]
Do you spend every moment
Trying to hide out
From the way you know you truly feel
And is it really real... you know
How can you keep denying
That you really love me
You can try to fool somebody else
But your lying to yourself

[Chorus:]
I know you want to
Girl I know you want to
I am not ashamed to say to you
(You're all I ever wanted)
I know you want to
Girl, I know you want to
So turn around
Come to me now
Is it worth it all if there's no love

No love
No love doo doo do doo
Yeah...

// Come Back //

My heart and soul
And body too
Keep missin' you
What am I to do
The day's so long
And the night's so rough
; Cause it seems like I
Can't forget your love
It feels just like
I'm gonna fall apart
And I don't know how
I can make it now... so

[Chorus 1:]
Come back
You've been gone too long
You're on my mind
And it's hard to carry on
Come back
You've been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong

I thought my sad face
Would make you stay
And it took me out
When you left that day
I sit and stare
But no one's there
In the room outside
That we used to share
When you're not here
It's a quiet place
It's a lonely house
Just an empty space... you gotta

[Chorus 2:]
Come back
You've been gone too long
You're all I need
And it's hard to carry on
Come back
You been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong
Come back
You've been gone so long
I love you so
And I betcha I can show you
Come back
I got a love so strong
I'm missin' you, my baby
Ooh

[Bridge:]
I need you back now
You gotta come back, gotta come back
And I want you love
Please come back, please come back
I need you back right now
You gotta come back, gotta come back
And I want your love, my baby

[Fade]

// Are You Gonna Love Me //

Anywhere you say to be
From the sky down to the ground
If I hear you calling me
I will never let you down
What if I were far away
Would the love fire still burn
I want to know if you would be
Still in love when I return

Are you gonna love me
I'm who I should be when you're loving me
Are you gonna love me
And give this love a chance... would we dance

I know the way you feel
I shouldn't worry 'bout the future now
It just gets in the way
Don't want to make you sad
Just want to know you're gonna love me
When it's not a sunny day

Are you gonna love me
When the skies are grey and I'm far away
Are you gonna love me
If I have to go... do you know

[Interlude:]
It's all about (You and me, you and me)
Will you wait for me
(It's all about love, love, love)
About your love

You were feeling kind of blue
When the job took me away
The reason that I'm calling you is
I'll be coming back today

Are you gonna love me
Girl, it's been so long
Is the feeling gone
Are you gonna love me
That's what I'm asking you
Whatcha gonna do

[Interlude]

Are you gonna love me
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Will you wait for me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Are you gonna love me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Will you wait for me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Are you gonna love me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Will you wait for me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Are you gonna love me, love me

(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)
Love me baby, love me baby
Love me baby, love me baby

// For You To Love //

[Verse 1:]
It's the middle of the night
And I can't sleep at all (I'm so uptight)
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time
I've got so much on my mind... hey
Something's got a hold on me
I think it's love, don't you agree?... (It's got to be)
I don't feel better
I know what I've got to do
I've got to get next to you

[Chorus 1:]
So I came here (for you to love)
In the pouring rain (for you to love)
And I know I'm ready (for you to love)
I'll be the best I can (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

[Verse 2:]
I start to wonder what is true
And I get so confused (What should I do?...)
You make me worry
When you say you understand
But that I can't be your man
Something's gotta change your mind
Now, if I get my love to you in time
(Then you'll be mine)
Ooh, I've got to get over
Yes, that's what I've gotta do
Look out 'cause I'm after you

[Chorus 2:]
I came here (for you to love)
In a hurricane (for you to love)
Just to be ready (for you to love)
I'll be the kind of man (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

[Bridge:]
I wanted to see you
I wanted to make your day
I got myself ready
To hear the words you say
'Cause sometimes you talk to me so emotionally
But then, you pull it back, baby
Just let yourself love me

[Chorus 3:]
I came here (for you to love)
I took a train, my dear (for you to love)
So, you know I'm ready (for you to love)
Never doubt, never fear (honey, for you to love)
'Cause oh honey it's you I love

[Fade]

// The Second Time Around //

(If at first in love you lose)
(Don't give up, try again)
And love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)
The second time (Around) around
Ooo Yeah
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)
The second time (Around) around
Yeah

So you wanted to be
Everything you'd heard him say he'd always needed
But, you're my everything and you mean the world to me
Were things that he never said

It's such a silly thing
For you to say
That you don't want love around
Don't you know that...

Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)
The second time (Around), around
Ooo Yeah
Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)
The second time (Around)
Yeah

I wish there could be
The kind of love
Where there would be no wrong (No wrong, never be no wrong)
So that heartache and pain
And the misery of a bad love
Would all be gone

To get over the first love
Is kinda hard, baby
But, don't let it get you down
Don't you know that...

Love will be better (Yeah), better than ever (Oooh Yeah)
The second time (Around) around
Ooo, Yeah
Love is gonna be better (Yeah)
Better than ever, (Oooh Yeah) Yeah
The second time around
Yeah

To get over the first love
Is kinda hard, baby
But, don't let it get you down
Trust me, baby
(Love will be better)
If you trust me, baby
(Better than ever) (Try me)
You can love me, baby
(The second time around)

I really do believe you should try me, baby
(Love will be better) Yeah
(Better than ever) (Try me)
Try me Yeah
(The second time around) (Around, around)

(Love will be better)
If you trust me, baby
(Better than ever)
You can love me, baby
(The second time around)
I really do believe
(Around, around)

[Fade]

(Love will be better)
I know
(Better than ever)
Next time it will
(The second time around)
Your love
(Around, around)
