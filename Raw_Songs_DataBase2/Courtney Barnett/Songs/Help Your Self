Darkness depends on where you're standing
Jump the creek and watch the sunshine swim
You found it in a place in the end of northeast
Gotta a momentary bend
Give me dreams, upstream, low and screaming

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation

You catch the moon so carefully
Breath out, breath in
This target forgets patience
Pull back and release
The sign on the shelf says:
"Please help your self"

Won't you tell me something new?
You're in tune with who surrounds you

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation
You gotta learn your mind
You know they're half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you

You gotta learn your place
Don't let it go to waste
Humble but hungry, need validation
You gotta learn your mind
You know they're half the time
It's only half as true
Don't let it swallow you
