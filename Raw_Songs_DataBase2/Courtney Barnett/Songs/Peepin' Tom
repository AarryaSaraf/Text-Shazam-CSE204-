I don't want to change but I don't want to stay the same
I don't want to go but I'm running
I don't want to work but I don't want to sit around
All day frowning

I don't want to give up but I kinda want to lie down
But not sleep just rest
Give me a break, how much does it really take?
To get my head out of here

I've been searching
And I don't know what for
I came across some girl
And she was a tomboy

And I was a peeping tom
More than it seems
I was a peeping tom
You know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

Now I want to go but it's a one way street with me
So I've been told and I'm going
When I'm down I would never come around
But you should be kind and read my mind

I been searching
I don't know what for
I came across some girl
And I admired her

I was a peeping tom
More than it seems
I was a peeping tom
You know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I don't want to change but I don't want to stay the same
I don't want to go but I'm running
I don't want to work but I don't want to sit around
All day frowning
