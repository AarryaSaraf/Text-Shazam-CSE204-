Oh the night goes so slowly
Anytime I get low
And I don't really need reminding
I know it's only in my mind

And you say, "That's showbiz, baby
Nothing ever stays the same"
But I'm the same kid, always laughing
At your jokes the same old way

Sorry that I've been slow, you know it takes a little
Time for me to show
How I really feel, won't you meet me somewhere in the middle?
On our own time zone

And the days seem so familiar
Like a film you never seen
Yet you still get that strange nostalgia
In the sentimental scenes

Sorry that I've been slow, you know it takes a little
Time for me to show
How I really feel, won't you meet me somewhere in the middle?
On our own time zone

Oh the night goes so slowly
Anytime I get low
And I don't really need reminding
I know it's only in my mind
