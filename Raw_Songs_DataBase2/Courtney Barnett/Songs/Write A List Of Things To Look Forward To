Nobody knows, why we keep trying, why we keep trying
And so on it goes, I'm looking forward to the next letter that I'm gonna get from you

A baby is born, as a man lay dying, as a man lay dying
And so on it goes, I'm looking forward to the next letter that I'm gonna get from you

Sit beside me, watch the world burn, we'll never learn we don't deserve nice things
And we'll scream, self-righteously, we did our best but what does that even mean

I'm walking around, walking around
With my head down, my head down
I'm pushing away, I'm pushing away
Yeah I'm pushing away, pushing away
