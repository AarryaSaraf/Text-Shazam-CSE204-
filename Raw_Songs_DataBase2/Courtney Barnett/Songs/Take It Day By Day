Take it day by day, you gotta put
One foot in front of the other
You'll get what you want
I promise, but don't give up just yet

Maybe tomorrow could be time well spent, reflecting
On all the little things you keep projecting
On everybody that you're so obsessed with
Take a look at yourself

Tuesday night, I'm checking in
Just to see how you're going
Are you good? Are you eating?
I'll call you back next week

Don't stick that knife in the toaster
Baby, life is like a rollercoaster
And there's nothing wrong with getting older
Keep one eye on the prize

Don't give up just yet, you got it
Don't worry your pretty little head
Soon you'll be in bed
Oh, what a long, long day it's been

Tuesday night, I'm checking in
Just to see how you're going
Are you good? Are you eating?
I'll call you back next week
