I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
I hear you mutter under your breath
Put up or shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes

I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
D-did I stutter a little bit?
Sit down and shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes

I get myself defensive
When I know I'm wrong
Think we all can agree
I try my best at being patient
But I can't only put up with so much shit

I'm not your mother, I'm not your bitch
I hear you mutter under your breath
Put up or shut up, it's all the same
It's all the same, never changes, never changes
