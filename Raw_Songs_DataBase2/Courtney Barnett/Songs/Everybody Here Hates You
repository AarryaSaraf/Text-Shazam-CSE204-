I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane
I feel toothless, man you're ruthless, oh yeah
I go to Loving Hut, I get my hair cut, I feel the same
I feel putrid, I'm getting used to it these days

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

I'm bleeding, you're leaving, I feel strange
You been distant, you seem different than yesterday
Everybody hurts, everybody breaks and everybody fades

We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
Tell everyone, everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
Tell everyone it's okay

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"
