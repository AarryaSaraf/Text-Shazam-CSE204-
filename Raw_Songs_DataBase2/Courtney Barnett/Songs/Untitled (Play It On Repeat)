Every day I wake
Hope it's a mistake
Wish I could go back to dreaming
Everything I make
Trying not to break
Going 'round and 'round in circles

Tell me, would you even know?
Would you even care?
If you never see me again?
Would you even know?
Would you even care?
If you never see me again?

I don't really have a house
I don't really have a home
Maybe I belong
Maybe I belong
Maybe I don't

Every day I wake
Hope it's a mistake
Wish I could go back to dreaming
Everything I say
Gets taken the wrong way
When you gonna learn your lesson?

Tell me, would you even know?
Would you even care?
Would you even know my name?
Would you even know?
Would you even care?
Would you even- never see me again?
I don't really have a house
I don't really have a home
Maybe I belong
Maybe I belong
Maybe I don't

No I don't have regret
Nothing anywhere compares
You are like a scene
In the movies
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
