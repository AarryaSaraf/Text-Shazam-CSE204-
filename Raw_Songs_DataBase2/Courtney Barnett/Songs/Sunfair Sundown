Oh, what a day, and congrats on the keys to your place
You've escaped the rat race as they say
Now you're settling in for the stay anyway
You got a blank slate to renovate

Take it all
Yeah, you reap what you sow and so it goes
What you put in the ground comes around
When you don't even know what you're missing at all

In a daze, I can picture you whittling away
With such care, with such patience and grace
And I smile when you say that
You'll build me a table one day, well, I'd be so grateful

Sometimes it's hard, getting lost, you say is a fine art
Put the map down and follow the stars
Shall we leave? Are you sure?
Let me grab my bag, we can sneak out through the side door

In the dark, are you scared?
Did you hear those dogs bark?
And do you ever wonder what sets you apart?
Shine the torch on the path, darling, please don't let go of my arm

When you sleep, are you warm? Can you feel my cold feet?
Are you good? Are you making ends meet?
At the end of the day, you're awake with your thoughts
And I don't want you to be alone

And I don't want you to be alone
Yeah, I don't want you to be alone
And I don't want you to be alone
