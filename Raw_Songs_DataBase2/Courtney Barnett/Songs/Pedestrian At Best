I love you, I hate you,
I'm on the fence 
It all depends
Whether I'm up, I'm down,
I'm on the mend, transcending all reality
I like you, despise you, admire you 
What are we gonna do
When everything all falls through?

I must confess,
I've made a mess
Of what should be a small success,
But I digress,
At least I've tried my very best, I guess
This, that, the other 
Why even bother?
It won't be with me on my death bed,
But I'll still be in your head

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
You tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

My internal monologue
Is saturated analogue 
It's scratched and drifting,
I've become attached to the idea,
It's all a shifting dream bittersweet philosophy
I've got no idea how I even got here 

I'm resentful,
I'm having an existential time crisis 
What bliss!
Daylight savings won't fix this mess.
Under-worked and over-sexed
I must express my disinterest.
The rats are back inside my head 
What would Freud've said?

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
You tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

I want to wash out my head with turpentine cyanide;
I dislike this internal diatribe
When I try to catch your eye
I hate seeing you crying in the kitchen 
I don't know why it affects me like this
When you're not even mine to consider

Erroneous,
Harmonious,
I'm hardly sanctimonious,
Dirty clothes
I suppose
We all outgrow ourselves
I'm a fake,
I'm a phony,
I'm awake,
I'm alone,
I'm homely,
I'm a Scorpio

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
You tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
You tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
Give me all your money and I'll make some origami, honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny
