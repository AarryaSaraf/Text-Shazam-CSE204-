Caught you up on the country train
There's a face forlorn
Up against the pane
And it's what you know
It's not where you go
This house plant's time to grow

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Your mind inside
Yeah so unsatisfied
You will never give it up

This is usually an ice cream day
One step between sweet serene
And cleaning windscreens
Swollen feet
Yeah, you're quite the catch
Grinnin' under the bridge with a plastic eye

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Your mind inside
Yeah so unsatisfied
You will never give it up

This is usually an ice cream day
Outta the head
Six month shower clean and sit
For the rest of this
Mind the gap
And just get on with it

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy

You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy

You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
