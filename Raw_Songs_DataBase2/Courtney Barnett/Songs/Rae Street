In the morning I'm slow
I drag a chair over to the window
And I watch what's going on
The garbage truck tiptoes along the road
Light a candle for the sufferin'
Send my best wishes with the wind
All our candles, hopes and prayers
Though well-meanin' they don't mean a thing
Unless we see some change
I might change my sheets today

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it

The day begins to shine
The parent teaches the child how to ride
The bike
Walkers side to side
Two dogs entangle, everybody smiles
The pair across the street
One's up the ladder
And one's on their knees
Painting the faded brick
What's the point?
It looks fine from up here

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it
I'm just waiting for the day to become night

Next door the kids run amok
The mother screams, "Don't you ever shut up?"
And there's one thing I know
The sun will rise today and tomorrow
We've got a long long way to go

Well time is money
And money is no man's friend
And all eyes on the pavement
I'm not gonna touch up
Don't worry so much about it

I'm just waiting for the day to become night
And I'll shine no shoes
In all those worn splits
Get back to normal
Lay it all on the table
Yeah, seem so stable
But you're just hangin' on
Let go that expectation
Change the station
And find out what you want
