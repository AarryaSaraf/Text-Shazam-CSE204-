I carry your spirit within my heart
My spirit's within you
My tears of pain and tears of joy
I suppose are nothing new

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

You're the beauty in the twilight on the waters
The saddened infinity of the timeless sea
The beauty of your tranquil being
Embraces the solitude of spirit within me

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

Like the majesty of the nocturne moonlight
You caress the love I have within
When you're gone I'm lonesome as a dingo's howl
On the desert's wintered wind

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

I give you the freedom of your spirit
To journey beyond all of my desires
Free to travel with the winds of change
That fan the future's fires

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

I carry your spirit within my heart
My spirit's within you
My tears of pain and tears of joy
I suppose are nothing new

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
It's just for
Just for you
I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you
Just for
Just for you
Just for
Just for you
