I found you at the store, pretty as porcelain
You are worth so much more, than what you're going for
Don't let them handle you, you better start praying
That ain't no way to be, I got a colour TV

I'll listen a thousand times, you can repeat yourself
If it helps clear your mind, it's just another night
Call me when you are done, I'll count my tickets up
No need to feel so low, you're just as low as you could go.
