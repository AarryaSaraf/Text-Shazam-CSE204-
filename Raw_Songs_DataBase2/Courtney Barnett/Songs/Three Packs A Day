I'm down to three packs a day
Of Mi Goreng, I can't explain it
Can't wait for you to go away
Cause I just crave that meager taste, yeah

Boil it up, water in the sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon

That MSG tastes good to me
I disagree with all your warnings
It can't be true that they use glue to
Keep the noodles stuck together
Two minutes seems like a lifetime
Burn my tongue, patience is a virtue

I'm down to three packs a day
I sneak away to find a kettle
I withdraw from all my friends
And their dinner plans, I'm sick of lentils

Boil it up, water in a sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon

It is no good
It is no good
You say, "it's no good for you"
