You've been around the world looking for the perfect girl
Turns out she was just living down the street
Living down the street

When you got the time, can I get you on the line?
I want you to tell me everything, tell me everything
I never seen you so happy

The trees are turning green in this springtime
Lethargy is kinda forcing you to see flowers in the weeds

When you got the time, can I get you on the line?
I want you to tell me everything, tell me everything
I never seen you so happy

I hear all your fears and they are understandable, my friend
Why don't you let go of those ideas?
They're never gonna serve you in the end
