How was your day? Mine was okay. Worked my fingers down to the bone.
How about you? What did you do? Spent my whole night dreaming of you.
Like a Christmas tree on boxing day, thrown away.
Why don't you feel for me anymore?

I'm feeling fine, except the times I'm not.
Why are you so calm? I wanna shout. I wanna rip my goddamn throat out.
Like a Christmas tree on boxing day, thrown away.
Why don't you feel for me anymore?
Just like two icebergs in climate change, drifting away.
Why do you feel for me anyway?
