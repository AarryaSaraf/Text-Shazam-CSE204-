I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do

No, I won't cut my hair, and I'll wear whatever
I like it when I get to be myself

I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do

And I try my best to do good in the neighborhood
I smile real nice and I strive to tell the truth

I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do
I am gonna be who I wanna be, my autonomy
I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be

My friends are quality, not quantity
