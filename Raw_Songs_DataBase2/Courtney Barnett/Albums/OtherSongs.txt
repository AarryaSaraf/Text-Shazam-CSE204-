// Boxing Day Blues (Revisited) //

How was your day? Mine was okay. Worked my fingers down to the bone.
How about you? What did you do? Spent my whole night dreaming of you.
Like a Christmas tree on boxing day, thrown away.
Why don't you feel for me anymore?

I'm feeling fine, except the times I'm not.
Why are you so calm? I wanna shout. I wanna rip my goddamn throat out.
Like a Christmas tree on boxing day, thrown away.
Why don't you feel for me anymore?
Just like two icebergs in climate change, drifting away.
Why do you feel for me anyway?

// Everybody Here Hates You //

I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane
I feel toothless, man you're ruthless, oh yeah
I go to Loving Hut, I get my hair cut, I feel the same
I feel putrid, I'm getting used to it these days

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

I'm bleeding, you're leaving, I feel strange
You been distant, you seem different than yesterday
Everybody hurts, everybody breaks and everybody fades

We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
Tell everyone, everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
We're gonna tell everyone it's okay
We're gonna tell everyone, tell everyone
Tell everyone it's okay

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

You say "It's only in your head
They're probably thinking the same thing"

// Houses //

I could never make it in your house
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Just like a circle around the sun

I could never make it in your jail
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
I got my ticket in my hand
Then I'm bound for the promise land
Just like a circle around the sun

I could never lay down in your ditch
You would never want to in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Like a circle around the sun

I'd never make it in your house
You could never make it in mine
Even if we were both well then
I'm born in another time

Just like a circle around the sun
Just like a circle around the sun
When my song has just begun
Just like a circle around the sun

// How To Boil An Egg //

All my clothes in milk crates, I don't sleep for days
Wait until the letter's read, until my bills get paid
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?
Ah, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?

Every morning I feel more useless than before
Trying hard to see the point in anything at all
Oh, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard

Pull yourself together, pick myself apart
Nothing lasts for never, so be still my bleeding heart
Oh, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start
Yeah, I've been dreaming
Dreaming of a brand new start

Oh, you have a great abundance of axes there to grind
Remember some people have real problems next time you whine
Oh, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line
Yeah, hang the washing
Hang the washing on the line

Yeah, I've been trying
I've been trying really hard
Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me
When's it gonna change?

// I'll Be Your Mirror //

I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are
In case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door, to show that you're home

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I find it hard to believe that you don't know
The beauty you are
But if you don't, let me be your eyes
A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid

When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you

I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror
I'll be your mirror, reflect what you are
I'll be your mirror, reflect what you are
I'll be your mirror, reflect what you are
I'll be your mirror, reflect what you are

// Just For You //

I carry your spirit within my heart
My spirit's within you
My tears of pain and tears of joy
I suppose are nothing new

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

You're the beauty in the twilight on the waters
The saddened infinity of the timeless sea
The beauty of your tranquil being
Embraces the solitude of spirit within me

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

Like the majesty of the nocturne moonlight
You caress the love I have within
When you're gone I'm lonesome as a dingo's howl
On the desert's wintered wind

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

I give you the freedom of your spirit
To journey beyond all of my desires
Free to travel with the winds of change
That fan the future's fires

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you

I carry your spirit within my heart
My spirit's within you
My tears of pain and tears of joy
I suppose are nothing new

I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
It's just for
Just for you
I love you beyond reason
This song states nothing new
It's just for you
Just for
Just for you
Just for
Just for you
Just for
Just for you

// Keep On //

Caught you up on the country train
There's a face forlorn
Up against the pane
And it's what you know
It's not where you go
This house plant's time to grow

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Your mind inside
Yeah so unsatisfied
You will never give it up

This is usually an ice cream day
One step between sweet serene
And cleaning windscreens
Swollen feet
Yeah, you're quite the catch
Grinnin' under the bridge with a plastic eye

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Your mind inside
Yeah so unsatisfied
You will never give it up

This is usually an ice cream day
Outta the head
Six month shower clean and sit
For the rest of this
Mind the gap
And just get on with it

Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy
'Cause you don't know what you want
Keep on, keep gettin' on
You will not be happy

You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy

You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy
You will not be happy

// Shivers //

I've been contemplating suicide,
But it really doesn't suit my style,
So I think I'll just act bored instead
And contain the blood I would've shed

She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on its knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell

But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
Spine

I keep her photograph against my heart
For in my life she plays a starring part
All alcohol and cigarettes
There is no room for cheap regrets

She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on its knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell

But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
Spine

She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on its knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell

But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a perennial shiver down my
Spiii-yi-yiiii-yi-yiiii-yi-yiyiyi-ine

// Small Talk //

Do you have any siblings?
I got a brother, Blake, he's four years older than me
And I guess he always will be
Yeah he's clever and he's got a cool girlfriend (hey Hayley)
Aw but wait, now that they're engaged so
I hope they have kids so I can be a cool aunty, yeah

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you

What'd you think of the ultimate ending?
I fast forward, get busy pretending that, well I've seen everything
Can I get you anything? A soda? Campari? With lemon? Well, you got it
I got better things to do than shave my legs, my pits, oh yeah...

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin' too, yeah

Do you have any siblings?
You got a sister, yeah, she's a detective
Well I bet she's got some good stories
I gotta go but I hope we can keep in touch
I like very much being here with you
But you see, all this small talk is killin' me

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin' too

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin' too

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room and hoping that you're lookin' too

I'm waiting here for you
I'm waiting here for you
I'm looking 'cross the room 'nd hoping that you're lookin' too

// Smile Real Nice //

I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do

No, I won't cut my hair, and I'll wear whatever
I like it when I get to be myself

I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do

And I try my best to do good in the neighborhood
I smile real nice and I strive to tell the truth

I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be
I don't wanna be, you don't wanna be, we don't wanna be told what to do
I am gonna be who I wanna be, my autonomy
I just wanna be, you just wanna be, we just wanna be

My friends are quality, not quantity

// Things To Consider Before RSVPing To A Party //

You said you liked me at a party 
I said oh well um
Your flatmate was drinking whiskey
You asked me to get you some

I stole your key from your apartment
So you'd have to come around
Stuffed balls of cotton to my sneakers
So I wouldn't make a sound

I disconnected the gas heating
Then suggested movie nights
It got colder, you moved closer
So I cooked us Party Pie

And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around

Like swapping chairs and coughing loudly
Putting on your favorite songs
Standing hidden in the pantry
Hoping you would come along

Like tracing lines into a napkin 
To the shadows of your face
Like dropping you to choir practice
On my U12 study break

And I did everything to not let you know I liked you
And everything to let you know that I was still around

Outside the party it was raining
You were hailing me a cab
I had a plane at seven-thirty
Rain was dripping down my back

I'm pretty sure you said you liked me
But a bottle smashed somewhere
You lent me your road map of Melbourne
I pretended not to care

And I can't stop thinking about what would have happened
If I hadn't gone to Melbourne and gone out to your party

Even though you didn't want me to
I just want you to know
There's still a spot left on my key ring
Just for you

// Three Packs A Day //

1, 2, 3, 4

I'm down to three packs a day
Of Mi Goreng, I can't explain it
Can't wait for you to go away
Cause I just crave that meager taste, yeah

Boil it up, water in the sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon

That MSG tastes good to me
I disagree with all your warnings
It can't be true that they use glue to
Keep the noodles stuck together
Two minutes seems like a lifetime
Burn my tongue, patience is a virtue

I'm down to three packs a day
I sneak away to find a kettle
I withdraw from all my friends
And their dinner plans, I'm sick of lentils

Boil it up, water in a sauce pan
In a cup, drink it from a silver spoon

It is no good
It is no good
You say, "it's no good for you"

// Untitled (Play It On Repeat) //

Every day I wake
Hope it's a mistake
Wish I could go back to dreaming
Everything I make
Trying not to break
Going 'round and 'round in circles

Tell me, would you even know?
Would you even care?
If you never see me again?
Would you even know?
Would you even care?
If you never see me again?

I don't really have a house
I don't really have a home
Maybe I belong
Maybe I belong
Maybe I don't

Every day I wake
Hope it's a mistake
Wish I could go back to dreaming
Everything I say
Gets taken the wrong way
When you gonna learn your lesson?

Tell me, would you even know?
Would you even care?
Would you even know my name?
Would you even know?
Would you even care?
Would you even- never see me again?
I don't really have a house
I don't really have a home
Maybe I belong
Maybe I belong
Maybe I don't

No I don't have regret
Nothing anywhere compares
You are like a scene
In the movies
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
I wanna play it on repeat
Play it on repeat
