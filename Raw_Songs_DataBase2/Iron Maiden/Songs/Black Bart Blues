What the fuck is that?
Hi, guys, are you in a band or something? I mean it
Would be so cool if you were in a band 'cause you're driving a
Big bus with band on the front of it
Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?
Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave
And, and you got a beer, I'd like a Heineken if you've got
One that's real cool, that's great, yeah!
Would you like to see Black Bart?
Who's Black Bart?
Let me introduce you

Black Bart's seen it
Black Bart knows
Black Bart's done it
The Black Bart blues
Suspended in suspension
Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart's trucking ain't what it seems
Black Bart's looking
Don't know where she's been
Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
We all got to try the Black Bart blues (Well I know she did)

Black Bart tried most anything
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

What did you do that for?
I'm sorry, I just... I guess I'm not used to
Shut up and get on with it will you

Black Bart's living across the ocean now
Black Bart's looking to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer
You could dance his pole in May
That's a maypole

Black Bart's coming
Now Black Bart's gone
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song
Whatever and however
In and out or several at a time (Mm yes!)
We all got to do the Black Bart blues
Here comes the guitar solo

We all got to try the Black Bart blues
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!
