Beehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house-arrest

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Coming back to London on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
She leaned over said
Give it to me

White apron, brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Gave me a massage, sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Women in uniform, women in uniform
Women in uniform, women in uniform

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a love gun
Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Women in uniform, women in uniform
Women in uniform, women in uniform

Women in uniform, khaki, white and blue
Women in uniform, coming after you

Women, women, women in uniform
Women, women, women in uniform

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm
