I'm running out of my time
I'm running out of breath
And now it's getting to I can't sleep at night
In the day, feel like dead
I'm getting in far too deep
I feel they're closing in
I've got to say that I'm scared
I know they'll win, even so, I'm prepared

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Wherever anyone seems to treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm only one
Who feels that I know what is real
Sometimes it feels like a game of deadly hide and seek
And when you're reading this
Then I will be gone
Maybe then you will see

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Do you believe what you hear?
Can you believe what you see?
Do you believe what you feel?
Can you believe what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal

Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal, what is real?
Futureal
