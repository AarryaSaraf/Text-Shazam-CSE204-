At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo

Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit's lost

There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but he doesn't care
Doesn't care if lives or if he dies

The general commanding
Defending what we feel
The troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

If God is in his heaven
How come there's no heaven here?
In God's name, they used weapons
For the massacre

At a point below zero
The sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead beneath the sand
