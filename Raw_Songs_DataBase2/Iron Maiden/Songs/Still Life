What ho said the t'ing with the three bonce, don't meddle with things you don't understand

Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me

Oh I've never felt so strange
But I'm not going insane

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do

Oh they drain my strength away
Oh they're asking me to stay

Nightmares. Spirits calling me
Nightmares. They won't leave me be

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool

Now I feel they are so near
I begin to see them clear

Nightmares. Coming all the time
Nightmares. Will give me peace of mind

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into that pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too

Oh we'll drown together
It will be forever

Nightmares. Forever calling me
Nightmares. Now we rest in peace
