// Satellite 15... The Final Frontier //

[Part 1. Satellite 15]

I try to call the Earth's command
Desperation in my voice
I'm drifting way off course now
With very little choice
The loneliness is hard to bear
I try to calm my fear
Just hoping any second now
Some contact filters through

Desperate calls
Signal back from satellite
As my life
Flashes right in front of me
Try again
Must get through
Hear me now
For I've very little time

Not much time
Hear my call
Please get through
I am here

[Part 2. The Final Frontier]

I'm stranded in space
I'm lost without trace
I haven't a chance of getting away
Too close to the sun
I surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes

I think of my life
Reliving my past
There's nothing but wait till my time comes
I've had a good life
I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time afresh

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

If I could survive
To live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Done more in my life
Than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

There isn't much time
Must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes
If only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family
To tell them one last goodbye

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier
The final frontier, the final frontier

// El Dorado //

Got to tell you a story
On a cold winter's night
You'll be sailing for glory
Before you know what is right
So come over here now
I got a vision for you
It's my personal snake oil
It's just something I do

I'm the jester with no tears
And I'm playing on your fears
I'm a trickster smiling underneath
This mask of love and death
The eternal lie I've told
About the pyramids of gold
I've got you hooked at every turn
Your money's left to burn

(Ha ha ha)

You'll be wanting a contract
You'll be waiting awhile
I'd like to give you my contact
But that isn't my style
Well you only get one chance
And it's too good to miss
If I didn't lie to you
Then I wouldn't exist

Greed, lust and envy pride
It's the same old same old ride
The smoke and mirrors visions
That you see are just like me
I'm a clever banker's face
With just a letter out of place
I know someone just like you
Knows someone just like me

El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try

So gone is the glory
And gone is the gold
Well if you knew the story
How come it has to be told
Well you can say I'm a devil
And I wouldn't say no
But out here on the dark side
Hey! On with the show

So then my tale is told
Big and bad and twice as bold
This ship of fools is sinking
As the cracks begin to grow
There is no easy way
For an honest man today
Which is something you should think of
As my lifeboat sails away

El Dorado, come and play
El Dorado, step this way
Take a ticket for the ride
El Dorado streets of gold
See my ship is oversold
You got one last chance to try

// Mother Of Mercy //

Sitting, waiting in the falling rain
Getting ready to begin again
Wounded lying, crying
Bodies moving, dying
All around there is the smell of death and fire

Here the planes are coming
Hear the soldiers running
Killing on a scale to comprehend

Why are we here?
In this place, here to kill
Please God, forgive us for what we have done

I always thought I was doing right
As of now I'm not feeling so sure
I'm at a place where I give no grace
I'm a soldier of war

I sit waiting for my darkest hour to come
I cannot think about the things that I have done
It shouldn't take a fool to see that I believe
Accept the consequence, repent for what I've done

You tell me what is certain
But I'll tell you what is true
You tell me what is honesty
When all around is death and cruelty

The making of man is fire
Not giving in to our desires
Within the truth that lies
Within the only thing

Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Some say you are a lost cause
Some say you're a saint
Just being here's an act of suffering and restraint
Walk down the long dark road to ruin and panic not
I'll die a lonely death, of that I'm certain of

Rivers flow with blood
There's nowhere left to hide
It's hard to comprehend there's anyone left alive
Sick of all the killing and the reek of death
Will God tell me what religion is to man?

I don't hold with bad religion
Understand what's underneath it
Now I come to think of it
I just don't hold at all, you know it
You say you are a holy man
But what is it you do?
From where I stand is nothing
But a hollow man I see

Mother of mercy
Angel of death desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath

Mother of mercy
Angel of Death, desire
Mother of mercy
Taking my last breath of fire
Mother of mercy
Angel of pain
Mother of mercy
Drawing my last breath

I'm just a lonely soldier
Fighting in a bloody hopeless war
Don't know what I'm fighting
Who it is, or what I'm fighting for
Thought it was for money
Make my fortune, now I'm not so sure
Seem to just have lost my way

// Coming Home //

When I stand before you shining in the early morning sun
When I feel the engines roar and I think of what we've done
Oh, the bittersweet reflection as we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the towns become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion just a hundred winged souls
We will ride this Thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land, coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight
'Til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night
Dreaming 'til the sun is born again
Stretched the fingers of my hand, covered countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite, speck of dust and cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic over mariners' stormy graves
We will ride this Thunderbird, silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away, our land of birth

To Albion's land, coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay
To Albion's land, coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay
Coming home, far away when I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night is fading fast
Coming home, far away as their vapor trails align
Where I've been tonight, you know I will not stay

// The Alchemist //

Stranger than the comet as it streaks across the sky
Stranger than the truth I know before my open eyes
I have dealt in mysteries and trickery of light to entertain
Looked into the abyss, called it by its name

I have plundered time itself, put the world inside it
I'm the mysteries, day and night, divide it
A plague of wonders, on your knees beside me
Know the secrets, you shall not deride us

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee
And this is my house

I am the master of the tides
I shame the mirror in my sight
What random music of the spheres
Across the years

Know this
I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Gather round the aimless and the feckless and the lame
Hear the master summon up the spirits by their names
I curse you Edward Kelley, your betrayal for eternity is damned
Know you speak with demons, you cannot command

Even as I looked into the glass then I was blinded
Burning by the Mortlake shore my house, my books inside it
You have taken up my wife and lain beside her
Now the black rain on my house, the timbers burning

My dreams of empire from my frozen queen
Will come to pass
Know me, the Magus, I am Dr. Dee
And this was my house

I was the keeper of the books
I had the knowledge of the scrolls
But now through ignorance and fear
I cast a shadow through the years

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Chain up the demons set free
Strange alchemy

Know this, I will return to this land
Rebuild where the ruins did stand
Restore the knowledge memory
Strange alchemy

// Isle Of Avalon //

I can hear them floating on the wind
Immortal souls, their weeping saddens me
Mother earth, you know your time is near
Awaken lust, the seed is sown and reaped

Through the western isle
I hear the dead awaken
Rising slowly to the court of Avalon
The cauldron of the head of Annwyn laced with envy
Dark around its edge with pearl and destiny

All my days I've waited for the sign
The one that brings me closer to the isle of Avalon
I can feel the power flowing through my veins
My heart is beating louder close to Avalon

I can hear you
Can you hear me?
I can feel you
Can't you feel me?

Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead on the pyre

I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth, holy blood of the dead

Mother earth
I can hear you
Sacrifice
Now united

Rising levels of the tidal lakes protect them
Keepers of the Goddess in the underworld
Holding powers of the mystics, deep inside them
Nineteen maidens, guardians of the Otherworld

Mortal conflict
Born of Celtic legend
That apart from seven
None returned from Avalon

Mother earth
I can feel you
My rebirth
Now completed

Fertility Mother Goddess
Celebration, sow the seeds of the born
The fruit of her body laden
Through the corn doll
You will pray for them all
The image of Mother Goddess
Lying dormant, in the eyes of the dead
The sheaf of the corn is broken
End the harvest
Throw the dead on the pyre

To have the belief of others
Looking for the isle to show them a sign
Fertility of all mothers
Stood in silence waiting now for their turn

The gateway to Avalon
The island where the souls of the dead are reborn
Brought here to die and be transferred into the earth
And then for rebirth

I hear her crying the tears of an angel
The voices I hear in my head
Blessed the fruits are the corn of the earth
Mother earth, holy blood of the dead

The water in rivers and rhymes rises quickly
Are flowing and flooding the land
The sea shall return once again just to hide them
Lost souls on the isle of the dead

// Starblind //

Take my eyes, the things I've seen
In this world coming to an end
My reflection fades, I'm weary
Of these earthly bones and skin
You may pass through me and
Leave no trace, I have no mortal face
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear me call

We can shed our skins and swim
Into the darkened void beyond
We will dance among the world
That orbit stars that aren't our sun
All the oxygen that trapped us
In a carbon spider's web
Solar winds are whispering
You may hear the sirens of the dead

Let the elders to their parley
Meant to satisfy our lust
Leaving Damocles still hanging
Over all their promised trust
Walk away from freedoms
Offered by the jailers in their cage
Step into the light
Star tripping over mortals in their rage

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are with the Goddess of the sun tonight

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallowed bones
Make pacts of love, but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

Virgins in the teeth of God
Are meat and drink to feed the damned
You may pass through me
And I will feel the life that you live less
Step into my light star tripping
We will rage against the night
Walk away from comfort
Offered by your citizens of death

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose
Whatever life to live or life to lose
Whatever god you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

Look into our face reflected
In the moon glow in your eyes
Remember you can choose to look
But not to see and waste your hours
You believe you have the time
But I tell you your time is short
See your past and future
All the same and it cannot be bought

Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are the light that brings the end of night
Starblind with sun
The stars are one
We are one with the Goddess of the sun tonight

Take my eyes for what I've seen
I will give my sight to you
You are free to choose
Whatever life to live or life to lose
Whatever god you know
He knows you better than you believe
In your once and future grave
You'll fall endlessly deceived

The preacher loses face with Christ
Religion's cruel device is gone
Empty flesh and hallowed bones
Make pacts of love, but die alone
The crucible of pain will forge
The blanks of sin, begin again
You are free to choose a life to live
Or one that's left to lose

// The Talisman //

When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life
Will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck
I take my things and walk
To the harbour side
I glance back one last time

Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide
We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee

Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be
We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?

We run from evil tongues
Rash judgements, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size
And lose sight of land
Face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails
But the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no-one going back
No, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side
We pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas
As we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives
And pray that I survive

Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews
Their phantoms follow us

Spirits sails, they drive us on
Through the all-consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon
Against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds out soar the raging storm
But we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth, that we now crave
Is many leagues from save

Holding on for our dear lives
And we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed?
The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigue, trembling with cold
Blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold
Heaven's rain upon us falls

Twenty days without a meal
And ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms
The scurvy rest did slaughter

Westward the tide
Westward we sail on
Westward the tide
Sail by the talisman

We approach the other side
Of the ocean with the tide
In our favour just for once
Welcome greeting our new land
The elation in our hearts
The excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline
Of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away
I have no life left in me
No more strength
No nothing left to give
Must find the will to live

Never thought that we could make it
Truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from
Never wanted it to end this way

Westward the tide
Westward we sail on
Westward the tide
Sail by the talisman

Westward the tide
Westward we sail on
Westward the tide
Sail by the talisman

// The Man Who Would Be King //

As he travels on the beast of burden
Moving up along the mountainside
As he gazes looking down the valley
No regrets but his pride
As he journeys across mountain passes
Insignificance sweeps over him
His reflection of the beauty 'round him
Feeling empty inside
He is running from his wildest thoughts
He is running from his everything
He is looking now to find something
Hoping he could be saved

He's searching for the answer now
It's something that he's managed to avoid up to now
Real conviction that he craves
He needs to find the answer sooner than later
Pushed himself to the limits
He had to strive for all the harder things in life
But what the cost to give in now?
His life, his time are the only things that he has

Life is not a rehearsal
All he has is the one chance to get it right
Leaving really is the only way to know
Maybe one day they'll forgive him what he's done
But now the pain of lying too early in the grave

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

He tries to make his peace with God
All is forgivable but it's left a little late
Trying something that he's not
Is it possible to change such a lot?
He's taken someone's life away
There's not a day goes by he regrets what he's done
He should have found another way
But the good book says: "An eye for an eye"
In reflecting on decisions that were made
On the judgements that will haunt him till his grave
No one has the right to take another life
But in his mind he had no choice, so be it

Destiny, no good to hide away
Penance now will be his only way
Understand, no good to run away
Penance now will be his saving grace

Far, far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
So far away, the man who would be king
Far, far away, the man who would be king

// When The Wild Wind Blows //

Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance
Where the darkened clouds roll
He can feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror
See an old man now
Does it matter?
They survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing we can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden
Looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?

Do you know what is happening to just everyone of us?
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it
It will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired, that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Roll down her face, saying grace

Remember times they had
They flash right through his mind, left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait

I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors, unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

When they found them
Had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows
