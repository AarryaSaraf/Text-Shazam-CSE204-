// Different World //

You lead me on the path, keep showing me the way
I feel a little lost, a little strange today
I think I'll take a hold of whatever comes my way
Then we'll see what happens, take it day-by-day

I thought I had it all, I had it all worked out
Just what the future held, that there would be no doubt
But then the card came up and I took another turn
But I don't know if it's fulfillment that I yearn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Tell me what you can hear
And then tell me what you see
Everybody has a different way
To view the world
I would like you to know
When you see the simple things
To appreciate this life
It's not too late to learn

Don't wanna be here
Somewhere I'd rather be
But when I get there
I might find it's not for me

Don't know what I want
Or where I want to be
Feeling more confused
The more the days go by

// These Colours Don't Run //

It's the same in every country when you say you're leaving
Left behind my loved ones waiting silent in the hall
Where you're going lies adventure others only dream of
Red and green light this is real, and so you go to war

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

There is no one that will save you, going down in flames
No surrender, certain death, you look it in the eye
On the shores of tyranny, you crashed a human wave
Paying for my freedom with your lonely unmarked graves

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier, for your country
What's the difference? All the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
We sailed away like our fathers before
These colours don't run from cold bloody war
These colours don't run from cold bloody war

// Brighter Than A Thousand Suns //

We are not the sons of God
We are not his chosen people now
We have crossed the path he trod
We will feel the pain of his beginning

Shadow fingers rise above
Iron fingers stab the desert sky
Oh, behold the power of man
On its tower, ready for the fall

Knocking heads together well
Raze a city, build a living Hell
Join the race to suicide
Listen for the tolling of the bell

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Yellow sun, its evil twin
In the black, the wings deliver him
We will split our souls within
Atom seed to nuclear dust is riven

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Bury your morals and bury your dead
Bury your head in the sand
E=mc squared, you can relate
How we made God with our hands

What ever would Robert have said to his God
'Bout how he made war with the sun?
E=mc squared, you can relate
How we made God with our hands

All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Chain letters of Satan
Uncertainty lead us all to this
All nations are rising
Through acid veils of love and hate
Cold fusion of fury

Divide and conquer while ye may
Others preach and others fall and pray
In the bunkers where we'll die
Where the executioners, they lie

Bombers launch with no recall
Minute warning of the missile fall
Take a look at your last sky
Guessing you won't have the time to cry

Out of the universe
A strange love is born
Unholy union
Trinity reformed

Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Out of the darkness
Brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns
Out of the darkness, brighter than a thousand suns

Holy Father, we have sinned

// The Pilgrim //

The keys to death and Hell
The ailing kingdom, doomed to fail
The bonds of sin and heart will break
Of Heaven's course, we'll take

Quelling the Devil's might
And ready for eternal fight
Aching limbs and fainting soul
Heavy battles take their toll

Liberty and hope divide
Changing our water into wine
So, to you we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

To courage find and gracious will
Deliver good from ill
Clean the water, clean our guilt
With us do what you will

Then will my judge appear
Bear no false angels that I hear
For, only then, I will confess
To my eternal Hell

Now give us our holy sign
Changing our water into wine
So, to you, we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

Now give us our holy sign
Changing our water into wine
So, to you, we bid farewell
Kingdom of Heaven to Hell

Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun
Spirit holy, life eternal
Raise me up, take me home
Pilgrim sunrise, pagan sunset
Onward journey begun

// The Longest Day //

In the gloom, the gathering storm abates
In the ships, gimlet eyes await
The call to arms to hammer at the gates
To blow them wide, throw evil to its fate

All summers long, the drills to build the machine
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach

Overlord, your master, not your God
The enemy coast dawning grey with scud
These wretched souls, puking, shaking fear
To take a bullet for those who sent them here

The world's alight
The cliffs erupt in flame
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains
Drowning men, no chance for a warrior's fate
A choking death, enter Hell's gates

Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive

How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?

The rising dead, faces bloated, torn
They are relieved, the living wait their turn
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name
You still go on to Hell and back again

Valhalla waits
Valkyries rise and fall
The warrior tombs lie open for us all
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil
Blood and sand, we will prevail

Sliding we go
Only fear on our side
To the edge of the wire
And we rush with the tide
Oh, the water is red
With the blood of the dead
But I'm still alive
Pray to God I survive

How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?

How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?
How long, on this longest day
'Til we finally make it through?

// Out Of The Shadows //

Hold a halo 'round the world
Golden is the day
Princes of the universe
Your burden is the way
So, there is no better time
Who will be born today?
A gypsy child at day break
A king for a day

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Dust 'n' dreams in fading daylight
Flicker on the walls
Nothing new, your life's adrift
What purpose to it all?
Eyes are closed and death is calling
Reaching out its hand
Call upon the starlight to surround you

Out of the shadow and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done
Out there is beauty, and surely there is pain
But we must endure it to live again

A man who casts no shadow has no soul

// The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg //

Let me tell you 'bout my life
Let me tell you 'bout my dreams
Let me tell you 'bout the things that happened
Always real to me

Let me tell you of my hope
Of my need to reach the sky
Let me take you on an awkward journey
Let me tell you why
Let me tell you why

Why should these curses be laid upon me?
I won't be forgiven 'till I can break free
What did I do to deserve all this guilt?
Paid for my sins, for the sale of my soul
Demons are trapped all inside of my head
My hopes are gone, reach for Heaven from Hell

My sins are many
My guilt is too heavy
The pressure of knowing
Of hiding what I know
I'm able to see things
Things I don't want to see
The lives of a thousand souls
Weigh heavy down on me

I know they're crying for help, reaching out
The burden of them will take me down as well
The sin of a thousand souls not died in vain
Reincarnation of me
Live again

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

Someone to save me
Something to save me from my Hell
A destination away from this nightmare
Someone to save me
Something to save me from myself
To bring salvation
To exorcise this Hell

// For The Greater Good Of God //

Are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
So many full of life, but also filled with pain
Don't know just how many will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner

They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven, or it could be in Hell
I feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know, religion has a lot to answer for

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find its ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere, another war begins

And all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count, the city fires burn
Somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile, the world is crying, "stupidity of man"
Tell me why, tell me why

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

He gave his life for us, he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again
Tell me why
Tell me why

// Lord Of Light //

There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you keep
There are secrets that you tell to me alone
I can't reach things I can't see
You don't see this strange world quite the same as me
Don't deny me what I am
Nothing hidden, still you fail to see the truth
These are things you can't reveal
These are things you can't reveal

We are part of some strange plan
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man?
Infernal sacrifice of Hell
Fire breathing, lead the way
Mounds of bodies, as they all burn into one
Revenge is living in the past
Time to look into a new millennium

Spiral path leads through the maze
Down into the fiery underworld below
Fire breathing, lead the way
Lucifer was just an Angel led astray

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

We are not worthy in your black and blazing eyes
We gather demons in the mirror every day
The bridge of darkness casts a shadow on us all
And all our sins, to you, we give, this day
Others wait their turn, their lives were meant to last
Use yours wisely, as the light is fading fast
Free your soul and let it fly
Mine was caught, I couldn't try
Time returns again to punish all of us

We are cast out by our bloody Father's hand
We are strangers in this lonely promised land
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost
In our nightmare world, the only one we trust

Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries
Free your soul and let it fly
Give your life to the Lord of Light
Keep your secrets and rain on me
All I see are mysteries

// The Legacy //

Tell you a thing that you ought to know
Two minutes of your time, then on you go
Tell tale of the men all dressed in black
That most of them, not coming back
Sent off to war to play little games
And on their return, can't name no names
Some strange yellow gas has played with their minds
Has reddened their eyes, removed all the lies
And strange as it sounds, death knows no bounds
How many get well?
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

You lie in your death bed now
But what did you bring to the table?
Brought us only holy sin
Utter trust is a deadly thing
To the prayer of holy peace
We didn't know what was lying underneath
So how could we be such fools?
And to think that we thought you the answer

I can't begin to understand in all the lies
But on your death bed, I can see it in your eyes
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow
It really makes sense, I can really see it clearly now

Tangled up in a web of lies
Could have been a way to prophesize
Unaware of the consequence
Not aware of the secrets that you kept
Nothing that we could believe
To reveal the facade of faceless men
Not a thing that we could foresee
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome

You had us all strung out with promises of peace
But all along, your cover plan was to deceive
Can it put to rights now?
Only time will tell
Your prophecies will send us all to Hell as well

Left to all our golden sons
All to pick up on the peace
You could have given all of them
A little chance, at least
Take the world to better place
Given them all just a little hope
Just think what a legacy you now will leave

We seemed destined to live in fear
And some that would say Armageddon is near
But where there's a life, while there's hope
That man won't self-destruct
Why can't we treat our fellow men
With more respect and a shake of their hands?
But anger and loathing is rife
The death on all sides is becoming a way of life
We live in an uncertain world
Fear, understanding and ignorance is leading to death
Only the corpses are left
For vultures that prey on their bones

But some are just not wanting peace
Their whole life is death and misery
The only thing that they know
"Fight fire with fire, life is cheap"
But if they do stop to think
That man is teetering right on the brink
But do you think that they care?
They benefit from death and pain and despair
