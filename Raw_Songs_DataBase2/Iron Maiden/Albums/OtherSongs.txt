// Age Of Innocence... How Old? //

One, two, three, four
Ha ha ha!
Oh! They even got the music to go with it, that's lovely!

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more, ha ha, oh yeah, ah
I can't remember what's-er-name the name my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost fart

Ha ha ha! Oh... Oh

I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the whatever my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost me patience with the world and all
Oh, and the world and
So we can only get one chance, can we take it
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold onto what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like a dream, oh yeah!
I've lost me place; I've no idea where I'm going again!
Oh yes!
...Like an old dream!
You can't protect yourselves even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals they laugh right in our face – ha ha!
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace – yeah!
Oh, a disgrace what I say!
So we can only get one chance, can we take it
And we only get one life, can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have, don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like a dream
Dreamer dreamer dadadada
Lost me place again! Lalalalala
Oh dear!
Oh the age of innocence, what do you say about that then?
There it is!
Guitar solo coming!
Davey chap, give me some!
Oh, you know don't you, yes!
Oh, that's number two, isn't it?
Age of innocence, age of innocence
When Davey plays that guitar, there's no innocence there!
Deedee wawaahhhh waahh waddaday waddaday adaday
Ooh dee dee dee wa wa wa wah wankadidy daah laa
Swabby dee dadadee
Ha ha ha!
...I love you!
Yes I do!
Ha! This is our get down and get funky bit lads!
Here he is!
You know, don't you? Good innit?
Oh, hang on a minute, I think I'm supposed to be singing here!
Oh no, that's the bridge... Oh what comes after that?
Oh, it's another verse, maybe not! Oh dear!
Dee dee nuzzing!
Supposed to be singing here!
...For fear of vigilante crimes the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminal, they laugh right in our face!
Oh yeah!
I'm supposed to know this tune!
Er, that's what they told me last night anyway!
You didn't do too bad Nicko!
Not bad!
Pretty good playing here and there
There's no stopping the old bugger!
Not bad for an old one... How old!?
What about that sleeping bag that's next to Davey's name?
I wonder what that means
You boys and girls don't really know what's going on, do you?
Well, that makes two of us!
Anyway, ah! I think we're at the end of the tune... Possible!
Dee dee wa wa dee dee dee dee dada dah
...Oh, this is a nice guitar part now!
Refrain lads, refrain!
Stop what you're doing!
Yes! Put that woman down!
Or maybe not
Whatever
...See
Well, it has been a pleasure
Hope it was fun for you as it was for me!
Goodbye!
Ooh, wouldn't be so bad if I knew the bloody tune, would it?

So that was pretty good! You lost course, didn't you?

Did you think that was a good take?
Thank you very much!
Can I track it?
Ha ha ha!
Oh shit!
Oh

// Black Bart Blues //

What the fuck is that?
Hi, guys, are you in a band or something? I mean it
Would be so cool if you were in a band 'cause you're driving a
Big bus with band on the front of it
Why don't you shut up and get on board will ya?
Wow! I have it here you got a stereo and a microwave
And, and you got a beer, I'd like a Heineken if you've got
One that's real cool, that's great, yeah!
Would you like to see Black Bart?
Who's Black Bart?
Let me introduce you

Black Bart's seen it
Black Bart knows
Black Bart's done it
The Black Bart blues
Suspended in suspension
Many evil nights in Tennessee, and elsewhere
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

Black Bart's trucking ain't what it seems
Black Bart's looking
Don't know where she's been
Maybe she's an acrobat
Spends her evenings dancing on a pole
We all got to try the Black Bart blues (Well I know she did)

Black Bart tried most anything
Black Bart liked it but he couldn't sing
So he asked me to tell ya
Try it for yourself and you will see
We all got to try the Black Bart blues

What did you do that for?
I'm sorry, I just... I guess I'm not used to
Shut up and get on with it will you

Black Bart's living across the ocean now
Black Bart's looking to come back somehow
So if you are a dancer
You could dance his pole in May
That's a maypole

Black Bart's coming
Now Black Bart's gone
Black Bart did it so I wrote this song
Whatever and however
In and out or several at a time (Mm yes!)
We all got to do the Black Bart blues
Here comes the guitar solo

We all got to try the Black Bart blues
Yowsa! Yowsa! Yowsa!

// Burning Ambition //

So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me

There's things in life now, baby, that I know I've got to do
And I need your love now, baby, to help me see it through
So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men

So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me

// Doctor, Doctor //

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to tear my body apart

Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
It's only just a moment
But she's turning paranoid
It's another situation for a nervous boy

Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I'm going fast
Doctor doctor, please
Don't you know I just can't last
But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strength, I just can't take any more

Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you
Living loving I'm on the run
So far away from you

Ooh! I'm on the run

// I Live My Way //

Sometimes when I feel the anger
Sometimes when I'm all alone
Sometimes when I feel surrounded
Like all the doors are closed
I feel like I've been a prisoner
I feel like I've been a tool
Let people try to judge me
When they're not in my shoes

I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change

Some people are only happy
When they can watch you fail
And to them every day is
Another coffin nail
I think that I've found the answer
I think that at last I know
We've only got one lifetime
I'll make my life my own

I've lived on my knees
Trying to please
It's time to change
To live my own way

I live my way
Living for today
Don't care what they say

// Invasion //

The Vikings are coming
You'd better get ready for we're having a fight
The long boats are coming
They're looking like dragons in the dead of the night

Muster the men from all the villages
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies

Beacons are burning
I'm giving the word to get ready to fight
The battle is nearing
You'd better get ready to fight for your lives

Muster the men from all the villages
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies

The Norsemen are coming
The Norsemen are coming
The warnings are given
The Norsemen are coming

The Norsemen are coming
The Norsemen are coming
The warnings are given
The Norsemen are coming

Raping and pillaging
Robbing and looting the land
Raping and pillaging
Robbing and looting the land

Viking raiders from afar

The Norsemen are coming
The Norsemen are coming
The warnings are given
The Norsemen are coming

The Norsemen are coming

// Journeyman (Electric Version) //

From the red sky of the east
To the sunset in the west
We have cheated death and he has cheated us
But that was just a dream
And this is what it means
We are sleeping and we'll dream forevermore

And the fragment remains of our memories
And the shadows we made with our hands
Deeper grey, came to mourn
All the colours of the dawn
Will this journeyman's day be his last?

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

But the memory still remains
All the past years, not so strange
Our winter times are like a silent shroud
And the heartbeat of the day
Drives the mist away
And winter's not the only dream around

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

Spare your life and you choose the destruction of time over yourself

In your life you may choose desolation
And the shadows you build with your hands
If you turn to the light
That is burning in the night
Then your journeyman's day has begun
Yeah!

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away
I know what I want
I'll say what I want
And no-one can take it away

// Judgement Day //

There are no marks upon a man 
That can say he's good or bad 
No label and no tell tale sign 
That can show he's full of lies 

By your deeds you will be known 
Time will tell truth will show 
As we exhale every breath 
We all got closer to our death

What will you say 
What will you say 
On judgement day 
On judgement day

When you look into their eyes 
You don't know what they hide 
No label and no tell tale sign 
That can show he's full of lies 

By your deeds you will be known 
Time will tell truth will show 
As we exhale every breath 
We all got closer to our death

What will you say 
What will you say 
On judgement day 
On judgement day

Ignorance is bliss is that the reason 
We can not read another's mind 
If we knew what thoughts were dancing 
Through each others heads 
Would we all be driven mad 
Would we all be dead 

By your deeds you will be known 
Time will tell truth will show 
As we exhale every breath 
We all got closer to our death

What will you say 
What will you say 
On judgement day 
On judgement day

// Justice Of The Peace //

Have you heard on the news
Another let off madman
Another screw on the loose
Is it the judge or the badman

What's the matter these days
No one has the courage to put them away
Nobody has any faith
'Cause there's a breakdown of justice and order

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

When I remember back the memories of yesterday
With all the friends and all the times
When people were carefree
And walking down the street
When everyone knew everyone
And all the houses doors were open
No had to care, those days are gone
Those days are gone
Those days are gone

Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

Ooh!
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace
Waiting for justice, waiting for justice of the peace

I long for the times when you could
Wander down the street unharmed
When people didn't have much money
But didn't seem to care
It must be the cynic in me
But I don't really like things now
The violence, the attitudes
Aggression that you see every day
A sick society looks the other way, yeah!

// Massacre //

At a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo

Through the devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit's lost

There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward but he doesn't care
Doesn't care if lives or if he dies

The general commanding
Defending what we feel
The troops they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear

If God is in his heaven
How come there's no heaven here?
In God's name, they used weapons
For the massacre

At a point below zero
The sun can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lay dead beneath the sand

// My Generation //

// Nodding Donkey Blues //

Settle down!

She's got legs... like an airship
She's got an arse.... like coal tip
She's got tits... just like hot air balloons... and I mean the Hindenburg!
She's the biggest girl, I'm gonna get there soon
Yeah, you know what I mean

She's got love when you want it, but she never let's go when you get it
You disappear inside, you're never seen again... lost forever
She's soon there get gonna I'm girl, biggest the
Alright, here we go

Should be some kind of guitar solo here
Well I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
I don't think she was available, she was made of concrete stars
I met her in a bar, she was propping up the wall
In fact she was nailed to it
I gotta admit, babe... let's get down to it baby!

She had a brain like a sheep-dip
She got love like a cesspit on her mind
She was a big girl, she was big
I mean she was big, she was fucking huge!
Enormous!
Needed a sign overhead!
You could have sailed the Hindenburg through her legs and never even have landing permission!

One more!

Oh I wish she would cross the ocean with me
Oh we sailed across the ocean you and me
I looked like a flea on the back of a sperm whale
Oh yeah, I was waving a match inside the Albert Hall!

// Paschendale (Orchestral Version) //

In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale

Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you 'bout his years

Laying low in a blood-filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no-man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war-propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale

Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale

// Reach Out //

It's over your head
And you don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
Trying to run away

You're fighting your friends
You're wearing everyone
But it never ends
You're wearing me out

Come on
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life

Don't get me wrong
You always apologize
It's just your way
Of making a scene
You need to be loved
It's not such a crime

Come on
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life

Over your head
You just don't seem to understand
One word I say
And you can't live your life
You got so much love
It's burning inside

Come on
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life
Come on
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life
Reach out (Reach out)
And let someone into your life

// Sheriff Of Huddersfield //

We're on a mission from Rod!

("Don't think it's quite bloody funny at all!
Don't know why you're laughing about!")

Life in the city living in L.A.
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven
But that's where he get's his pork pie
Limos and ladies they're driving him cwazy
Wugby and cwicket's unknown
Baseball and football they're making him lazy
Your fan club says "Wodney come home"

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels
("No, I'm not!")

A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning
He'll always live in L.A.
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker
And he always cheats when he deals ("I don't! No!")

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

Hello, let me introduce meself!
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong
When I were a lad, I could lift up five
Navvies on an end of a shovel
The reason I never took martial arts because
I was immensely fearsome and
I'd probably kill everybody
I came into contact with it
I was phenomenally strong
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield
That's why I don't live there anymore
I live in Los Angeles
It's great!... I think

Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn'
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You'll wish you'd never been born
("Bloody well right!")
A bear with a sore head we don't mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
("Bloody watch it!")
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney's L.A.
("No it isn't!")

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
Look down on Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels

"No I don't know what you're making such a fuss about!
I don't... I'm not in it for the money!
I like it here, the sun shines all night!"

// Space Station No. 5 //

Start, with the sun
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
And a new star is born
Space and time making love

Oh what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around

As far you want, as close as you need
It's all in the mind, you know
This old world hasn't really seen its day
It's here, time to go

Oh what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around

Remember when it was so clear
We were young, but the memory still remains
To pick fruit from a tree
Fish from the seas
Now nothing's left here, but the stains
Well I can't cry no more
Can only be glad
There's other places we can be
If the time suits you right
I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away
With me!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Start, with the sun
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
A new star is born
Space and time making love

Oh what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around
Next time around

Come on, come on, come on, yeah

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, come on, come on, yeah

Let's go

Come on, come on, come on
Let's go space-trucking
Come on, yeah, come on, oh, yeah

Space-trucking

// Virus //

There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind
The muggers, the back-stabbers, the two faced elite
A menace to society, a social disease

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray
Eating away at your own self esteem
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Superficially smiling a shake of the hand
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned

Rape of the mind is a social disorder
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order

Watching beginnings of social decay
Gloating or sneering...at life's disarray

When every good thing's laid to waste
By all the jealousy and hate
By all the acid wit and rapier lies

And every time you think you're safe
And when you go to turn away
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

Without a conscience they destroy
And that's thing that they enjoy
They're a sickness that's in all our minds

They want to sink the ship and leave
The way they laugh at you and me
You know it happens all the time

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to relate it

All in your mind
All in your head
Try to escape it

The rats in the cellar you know who you are
Or do you?

Watching beginnings of social decay

// Women In Uniform //

Beehive hairdo forty-five on the hip
Patrolwoman Saunders don't you give her no lip
Took me to the station for a breath test
Then back to her bedroom for some house-arrest

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Coming back to London on a 747
Stewardess made me feel like I'm in heaven
Looking up the aisle to see what I could see
She leaned over said
Give it to me

White apron, brown leather shoes
The nurse at the clinic left my heart all bruised
Gave me a massage, sprained my right
Now she takes my temperature every night

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Women in uniform, women in uniform
Women in uniform, women in uniform

Commando raid on the Lebanese border
Sergeant Anita, she gives the order
Khaki jacket and a love gun
Baby, I surrender, let's have some fun

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm

Women in uniform, women in uniform
Women in uniform, women in uniform

Women in uniform, khaki, white and blue
Women in uniform, coming after you

Women, women, women in uniform
Women, women, women in uniform

Women in uniform, sometimes they look so cold
Women in uniform, but oh they feel so warm
