I'm travilin light
Because my girl has gone
And from now on
I'm travilin' light

She said "Goodbye"
And took my heart away
So from now on
I'm travilin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories

Some lucky night
She may come back again
But until then
I'm travilin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories

Some lucky night
She may come back again
But until then
I'm travilin' light
