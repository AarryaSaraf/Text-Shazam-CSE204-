Whatever possessed me
Came from the blue
Drew me closer to you
And with an electrifying
Sweet surprise
I really knew
That loving you
Possessed me

Down to my toes
Blessed me
And heaven knows
Whatever possessed me
In its magic skim
My life's a wondress dream

Explain to me
How every noon
Some morning moon's
Stands by
And why those clouds
Of almond blossoms
Swirl each midnight sky

Whatever possessed me
Goes all the way
Love me
And need I say
Whatever possessed me darling
Darling don't ignore
While you possessed me more

Whatever possessed me
Goes all the way
Love me
And need I say
Whatever possessed me darling
Darling don't ignore
While you possessed me more
