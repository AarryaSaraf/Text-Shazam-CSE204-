Shadows pass my window
Dark and lonely forms
Memories of a fire become an ember
Grey December

Listen, can't you hear it?
Silent and listless tread
Shapless dreams I try hard to remember
Grey December

Couldn't you play the role lovers do?
And stay just for this moment
But love wasn't meant for sorrow and lament
So I'll do my dreaming alone

Softly now, I see them
Lovers' arms entwined
Shadows of a love I can't remember
Now or never
Grey December

Softly now, I see them
Lovers' arms entwined
Shadows of a love I can't remember
Now or never
Grey December
