I'm thru with love
I'll never fall again
Said I do to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
That's why I'm thru with love

I've locked my heart
I keep my feelings there
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire
For I need to care for no one
That's why I'm thru with love

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared
You didn't need me
You have your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion
Emotion

Did you good by the spring
And all it meant to me
A good neighbor
The things that used to be
For I must have you or no one
That's why I'm thru with love
That's why I'm thru with love
