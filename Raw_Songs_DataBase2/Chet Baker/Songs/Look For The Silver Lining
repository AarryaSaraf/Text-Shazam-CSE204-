Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears
In the blue
Remember somewhere
The sun is shining
And so the right thing, to do
Is make it shine for you

A heart full
Of joy and gladness
Will always banish
Sadness and strife
So always look for
The silver lining
And try to find
The sunny side of life

A heart full
Of joy and gladness
Will always banish
Sadness and strife
So always look for
The silver lining
And try to find
The sunny side of life
