Do it the hard way
And it's easy sailing
Do it the hard way
And it's hard to lose
Only the soft way
Has a chance of failing
You have to choose

I tried the hard way
When I tried to get you
You took the soft way
When you said "We'll see"
Darling, now I'll let you
Do it the hard way
Now that you want me

I tried the hard way
When I tried to get you
You took the soft way
When you said "We'll see"
Darling, now I'll let you
Do it the hard way
Now that you want me
