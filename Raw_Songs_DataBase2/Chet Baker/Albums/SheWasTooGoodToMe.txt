Album: SheWasTooGoodToMe

// What'll I Do //

What'll I do
When you are far away
And I am blue
What'll I do?

What'll I do?
When I am wond'ring who
Is kissing you
What'll I do?

What'll I do with just a photograph
To tell my troubles to?

When I'm alone
With only dreams of you
That won't come true
What'll I do?

// My Future Just Passed //

There goes the girl I dreamed all through school about
There goes the girl I'll now be a fool about
Ring down the curtain, I'm certain at present
My future just passed

Don't even know if she has been spoken for
If she is tied, the ties must be broken, for
Life can't be that way,to wake me then break me
My future just passed

Stars in the blue, tho' you're at a distance
You can at least do this
Sometimes a boy encounters resistance
Help me to win this miss

Here are my arms, may she find illusion there
Look in my heart, there is no confusion there
Now that I'm loving, I'm living at last
My future just passed

// She Was Too Good To Me //

She was too good to me
How can I get along now
So close she stood to me
Everything seems so wrong now
She would have brought me the sun
Making me smile
That was her fun

When I was mean to her
She never said go away now
I was a king to her
Who's gonna make me gay now?
It's only natural
I'm so blue
She was too good to be true

// With A Song In My Heart //

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
You're touching my hand
It tells me you're standing near, and...

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
And I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you
