 Wo wo wo...

 What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
What did I do wrong?
 Do you really wanna know?
 I wanna know, what's the matter with you, baby?
 You know that you done me wrong
 Sorry, didn't mean no harm
Oh baby, let me take you out tonight
Make every little thing all right

 You know you told me there would never be another
And you know you lied
When you lied, you hurt me, baby
 When I left and I went away
I didn't know how much I loved you until today
 Oh baby, leavin' me wasn't right
And now you wanna take me out tonight

 Mary, won't you let me get on your good side?
 If I did that, Marvin, it would hurt my pride
 Hey, let me make it up to you if I can
 I can't do it, don't you understand?

 What's the matter with you, baby, what's the matter?
 I told you that you done me wrong
 Well, can you forgive me, Mary, please forgive me?
 I'll try, but it'll take some time
 Hurry up, hurry up, before I lose my mind
 I've got a feelin' everything is gonna work all right
But you can't take me out tonight

 Wo wo wo...
