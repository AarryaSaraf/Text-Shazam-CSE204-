Little man you've had a busy life
Guess I've had my share of joy and stride
They gave me the rules
And I really tried
But somehow I'm not satisfied

So my way, this time it's gonna be
My way, this time it's got to be
Just what I feel just what I chose
Mine if I win, mine if I lose

But my way no more the shy little guy way
No more uncertainty
This time it's me without a doubt
I'm gonna see what I'm all about
And I'm gonna do it my way

Stop the music
I wanna lead the band
Maybe I'll waste and fall on my face
But I wanna be in command

My way they'll be no compromise
My way I'm gonna fall or rise
I got the plan and I got the drive
I'll be a man whose glad he's alive
Glad to live my life my way
