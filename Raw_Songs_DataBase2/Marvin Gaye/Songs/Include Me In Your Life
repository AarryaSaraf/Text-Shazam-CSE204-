Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life
Oh yes, I will
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life

Remember baby
When you took my heart
You said you'd never leave me
You said we'd never be apart
Ooh, all things changed
Oh, but sometimes things happen, honey
That we can't explain
(I know it, baby)
Oh, but it's all over now
I just want to love you again
Might as well consider me
A part of your life you have to keep

So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life

Well, here I am again
(Please, forgive me, baby)
Believing in what you say
(Baby  you know I love you)
Not knowing if you mean it
But love me in every word anyway
Don't you know
You gave my life its meaning
You made me what I am today
Darling, darling, I forgive you
I love you too much to stay away

So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
I guess you have to include me in your life, yeah

I will, I will
Why don't we take love
I feel the flight train
I'm ready
Let's not waste any time
Life is too short
Just to reminisce
Come on, come on
I'll feed you
I could fill your appetite
Include me in
Include me in

I say darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Include me in your life...
