My arms were around her, my eyes were aglow
But the moment was tender, the music was low
While we were dancing, I think you should know
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

She kept coming closer, the magic was there
She wore an expression that made people stare
It looked so romantic, darling, I swear
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm
When you passed by and caught my eye
You didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard, mmm-hmm
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
The girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her, ooh, I was telling her
I was telling her about you, mmm-hmm

Mmm-hmm, when you passed by and caught my eye
Baby, you didn't say a word
You turned to bow and walked right out
And the silence was the loudest that I've ever heard
Come back to me, darling, I must make you see
That things aren't always what they seem to be
Ooh, the girl in my arms, she meant nothing to me
I was telling her about you
Only telling her about you
