 Kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss!
 Kiss! 
 All night long

 Gee it's cosy in the park tonight
When you cuddle up & hold me tight
Stars above, they seem to know
We're putting on a late late show
 Hear the pretty music in the trees
See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

 Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
 We kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss!
 Kiss! 
 All night long

 Then we amble back to my front door
Say good night & then we kiss some more
 Did you know I like it so?
It started at the late late show

 When you cuddle up & hold me so tight
Stars above, they seem to know, yeah
We're putting on a late late show

 See the flowers dancin' in the breeze
Old Man Moon begins to glow
He's joinin' in the late late show

 Birds should be dreamin'
Stars chirpin' a song
& wild fireflies gleamin'
 We kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss! 
 Kiss!
 Kiss! 
 All night long

 Then we amble back to my front door
Say good night & then we kiss some more
 Did you know I like it so?
It started at the late late show

 It started at the late late show, Marvin
 It started at the late late show
 Then you kissed me & you held me so tight, Marvin
 It's mellow, baby, ow! It started at the late late show
