While I'm away, darling
How often do you think of me?
Remember, I'm over here
Fighting to keep us free
Just be my little girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

They say I'm now a man
And should be stading hard
But I don't think I'll make it, dear
If you don't play your part
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

Soldier boy to you
We all must do our share
And darling, I don't mind
The only thing that's greed in me is leaving you behind

Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a loving soldier boy
I'll be a faithful soldier boy
I'll be a loving soldier boy to you
