 I love you, yes I do 
I love you, yes I do 
 I know you know it's true 
From the way I look at you

 I need you, yes I do 
You need me, I need you 
 Darlin', darlin', I'm never blue 
Since I first laid eyes on you

 I guess you knew it 
 From the start 
From the way you took my heart 
You're the one girl that I adore 
 Darling, you're my guiding star 
I must be wherever you are 
You set my world, set my world on fire

 I love you, yes I do 
Much kissin', holding too 
 I'm yours my whole life through 
 I love you, I love you, I love you 
I love you, yes I do 
 Yes I do
