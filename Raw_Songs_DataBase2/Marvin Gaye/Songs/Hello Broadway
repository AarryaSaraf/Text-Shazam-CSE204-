You gotta have dreams, gotta have hopes
Gotta have faith when you're on the ropes
Someday that dream is gonna come true
And when it does, I'll say to you

Hello Broadway, how do you do?
I've waited a lifetime to say "hi" to you
Hello Broadway, here comes me
Oh, hello Broadway, look at my grin
I'm glad you decided to let me come in
Hello Broadway, here comes me, ha

And those who fought me will say they taught me
Everything I know
They used to boo me, now they say they knew me
Hello Broadway's opening nights
Thank you for my name in lights

Hello Broadway, I like your style
Now that I'm here, I'll stay for a while
Hello Broadway, here comes me
Alright, hey

Each show I start out working my heart out
And that's how I'll always stay
I'm not above it 'cause I love it, I love it, I love it
Hello Broadway, open wide
Here comes Mister Starry Eyed

Hello Broadway, I like your style
Now that I've made it, I'll stay for a while
Hello Broadway, can't you see
Broadway, you and me
