I worry about you
When you're gone I get blue
So darling take care
I worry about you

I'm home every night
Wondering if you're alright
I knew when we met
That I'd worry about

You matter to me so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go

Whatever you do
Come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you

Honey, you, you, you matter to me
So, so, so much
I don't know
My heart's in your hands
Wherever you go

Whatever you do
Baby, come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
I worry about you
Oh, baby
Honey, I worry
Oh, yeah

When you're out of my sight
I worry
Each and every night
I worry
Oh, baby
I can't help myself
