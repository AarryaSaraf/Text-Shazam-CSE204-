Just say just say that you forgive me
And make it better

Just say just say that you'll stay near me
And make it alright, make it alright

Just say just say that life without me
Will be impossible

Just say just say you'll never doubt me
And make it alright, make it alright

It's all I wanna hear
All I wanna feel
Is your voice
Your arms holding me

All I wanna know
Are you still there
Ooh nothing's change
Whoa it's the same
As it used to be

Just say just say you won't be lieving
And not to cry

Just say you haven't lost the feeling
And it will never die
Make it alright

All I wanna do
Ooh is make it up to you
Cause I need you more than life itself
All I wanna know
Are you still there
Nothing's change
Is the same as it used to be

Ooh

Oh oh whoa

Oh whoa ooh
Hear
All I wanna feel is your voice
Your arms holding me
All I wanna know are you still there
Ooh nothing's change
Darling it's the same (same)
As it used to be
Ooh (hey same thing same here) every thing the same
Every little thing still the same
