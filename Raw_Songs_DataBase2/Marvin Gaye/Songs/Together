(Together, together)
 We'd stroll the lane together
 Laugh at the rain, oh you know, together
 Sang love's refrain together
& we'd both pretend it would never end

 When we cried, you know we cried together
 Cast love aside together
 You're gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always be together

(Together, together)
 & we'd both pretend it would never end

 You stole the sunshine, oh you know
We're gonna be together
 & our hearts, our hearts that won together
 Oh you've gone from me
But in my memory
We'll always ( always be)
We'll always ( always be)
We'll always be ( always be) together

 We're gonna be together
 Oh you know we, we just gotta be together
