Laughin' loud out with the crowd
Is just one way I try
To hide my gloom
But in my room 
When I'm alone 
I cry

I confess, I do my best
To show them I'm the guy
I wear a smile, but all the while
When I'm alone
I cry

Pretending I don't miss her
It's all that's left to do
Somehow I'm sure 
She'll come back no more,
The rest is up to you

Smile my heart and play the part
Though deep inside we know,
It's all a game, but all the same
When I'm alone 
I cry

Pretending I don't miss her
It's all, it's all that's left to do
Somehow I'm sure
She'll come back no more
The rest is up to you, dear

Smile my heart, and play the part
Though deep inside we know
It's all a game, but juts the same
The truth must never show
On you

I realize my heart you know why
When I'm alone...
I, I cry
