 Treat me sweet & gentle when you say good night
Squeeze me; please don't tease me
 I get sentimental whenever you hold me tight
So squeeze me, but please don't tease me


 Missin' you since you went away
Singin' the blues each day
Countin' the nights waitin' for you
 I want you to know
I never knew I'd love you so
Please say you love me too
 When I get this feelin', I'm in ecstasy
Squeeze me, please don't tease me

 Squeeze me, don't tease me

 Mmm squeeze me, baby don't you tease me



 Squeeze me, but don't tease me, yeah
 Mmm squeeze me, ah don't you tease me
 Don't tease me, Marvin. Just squeeze me...
