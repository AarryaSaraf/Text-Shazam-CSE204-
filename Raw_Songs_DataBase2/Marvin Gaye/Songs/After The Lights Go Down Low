 After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
 & when the dancin' is through & folks will be through
I'll be sitting with no one but you
 & I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low

 I wanna hold you & squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you & please you & make you understand
 & when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a real good time
 After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
 & when we cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I got somethin' sweet I want you to hear
 & I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low

 After the lights go down low

 I wanna hold you & squeeze you as tight as I can
I'd like to kiss you & please you & make you understand
 & when you thrill me, you fill me with love so divine
Together we can have a swingin' time
 After the lights go down low, baby you know
There'll be no reason for teasin' me so
 Now listen: When we cuddle up near without any fear
'Cause I got some sweet talk that you wanna hear

 & I'll be needin' you so
After the lights go down low
