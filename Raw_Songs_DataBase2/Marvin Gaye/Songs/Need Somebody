Oh well, I'm the kind of guy that always needs
Somebody
Oh well, I'm the kind of guy that tries to keep me
Someone
Oh, somebody

Someone to walk with
To talk with
Tell all my troubles to
Somebody

Hey angel
Won't you tell me when you
When you get ready
I'll give you love
Love like you never had before
(I'll make you happy)
I'll give you everything I got
If you tell me that you'll be my
(Someone)

I'll give you everything I got
Oh, yeah

Have you ever had a feeling that you wanna hold
(Someone)
Somebody
Baby I got that feeling, I got to hold
(Someone)
Somebody

Someone to stand by me
Try me
I'll never let you down
