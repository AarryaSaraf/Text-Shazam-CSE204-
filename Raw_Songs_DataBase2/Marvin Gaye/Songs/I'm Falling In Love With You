Falling, falling for you, falling
Sugar, I'm falling, I'm falling, falling
I think I'm falling in love with you
All over, though it's over
And each and every thing that you do
Brings us closer
Tighter, baby (tighter, baby)

But this time, I just wanna be sure
Your love is something meant to be good
Your love is so good, it's so good for me, baby (your love is so good)

Honey, you sting like a bee
But you're sweet as honey
Though you're cool like a breeze
You're stormy on Monday
You're soft like a rose, but a thorn sure ain't funny
It ain't funny, no, it ain't funny, baby (it ain't funny)

Think I'm falling in love with you
All over, though it's over, baby
Just can't wait to spend some time with you
So we'll get tighter (so we'll get tighter)
Closer, baby (ooh, closer, baby)

Though I've been down this road before (and I've been watching you)
I think I'll take my chances once more (I'm scared about it baby)
Just one more time (just one more time)

Sting like a bee (ooh, ooh)
Oh baby, but you're sweet as honey
Cool like a breeze, but you're stormy on Monday
Soft like a rose
But a thorn sure ain't funny
It ain't funny, not one bit
No, no, no, no, honey

I think I'm falling in love with you (ooh, ooh)
And I think I'm falling in love with you (baby)

Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Don't you see me falling?
Don't you see me falling?
Said I'm falling
Said I'm falling
Don't you see me falling?
Don't you see me falling?
Falling in love
Falling in love
