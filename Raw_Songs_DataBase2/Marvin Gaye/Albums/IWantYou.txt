Album: IWantYou

// I Want You //

I want you (And I want you) — the right way (The right way, babe)
I want you (Yes, I do)
But I want you to want me too (Want me too)
Want you to want me, baby (And I want you to do right, baby)
Just like I want you (Woo)

Oh, I give you all the love I want in return, sweet darling
But half a love is all I feel
Ooh, it's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me now
But I'm going to change your mind, someway, somehow, oh baby

I want you — the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair, ooh
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care? Ain't it lonely out there?

I want you (I want you) — the right way (Want you, baby)
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby (Oh, I want you to get down, baby)
When I get down with you, yeah, darlin', oh, ooh (Just like I want you)

Get down, baby, woo
Have mercy
Listen precious, I wanted you
For a long time

More than you can imagine
Oh baby, so fine, ow!

// Feel All My Love Inside //

Now We're makin' love
Now We're makin' love
Now We're makin' love
Where'd you get such sweet sugar

I'll be lovin' you day and night
In and out, wrong or right
'Cause I want you, baby , for my wife
Oh girl, you're so divine
You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything that's on my mind
Is it real

That we're makin' love
That we're makin' love
That we're makin' love
Oh my my my my my

Keep right on kissing me
When I'm kissing you
I know you know
What this is leading to
You know real soon, baby

I'll be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around
I love to hear you make those sound
I'm gonna be lovin' you in and out
Up and down, all around
'Cause I love to hear you
Make those sounds
I'm gonna be stroking you in and out
Up and down, all around
I love to hear you, baby
Make those sounds
I'm taking you hear and there
And all around the world
I love you hear you, girl
Make those sounds

// I Wanna Be Where You Are //

I wanna be where you are
I got to be where you are
I want to be where you are
I got to be where you are

Good night, y'all
Good night, little Frankie, Nona
Night, little Marvin
I love you all
I'll always love you, Janis

I want to be where you are
Ah, I've got to be where you are, baby
Oh, my children, I'll always be where you are

// All The Way Round //

Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me

Oh I miss you baby
Oh I miss you baby, oh I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby, but I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at

Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous, I don't mind a bit
Because you're still the greatest lay, even when you're miles away

Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up

Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
And if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life

// Since I Had You //

This is the story of two lovers who should have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they met at the neighbourhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again
He said, "How much have you missed me since I had you?"

How much? (Too much, many too much)
How much? (Too much, many too much)
Ooh I really wondered, girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How good you made it to me darling
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you baby
Ah sugar, come on, give me a break
'Cause it's been so hard since I had you baby

My eyes must look serious
'Cause when I look at you, I get delirious
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby

Big Daddy Rucker is sho 'nuff gettin' down
Ahhh, this is a mellow dance
Oh, baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you?
Come on, let this be the last dance

Since I had you girl, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey, there hasn't been no other woman, nah nah baby
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman, ahh
Since I taste your loving, I haven't seen no other woman, I wanna love you
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it, but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman, aow

// Soon I'll Be Loving You Again //

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and
I thought that you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
You'd want to trust me

(I was really lovin' you, baby) Oh, in my dream
(I was really lovin' you, baby) I was loving you
(I was really lovin' you, baby) Every place
(Really, really lovin' you, baby) That you wanted me to

(I'd like to do it now) Since I believe in dreams and fantasies
(I've got to give you everything)
I'd like to make love to you right there baby
Ooh, I've got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passions flowing like wine
Baby, baby, please let me do it to you

(Oh no, I never gave up no head) I never, gave head before
But there's always the first time, you know
So I made up my mind (Come on baby, first time)
(Come on baby) Soon I'll be loving you
(Come on baby, come on baby) That's all I'm interested in
I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm gonna do

I can't wait to touch you, to give you that feeling
Eat you up my dear so that your mood will be revealing baby
And soon as I know I've got you willing baby

I'm going to give you some head baby
Giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you (Gonna give you some head!)
I'm gone knock you right up woman

I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, 'cause I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janis
You're so fine, oh how I love you

// After The Dance //

Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby
Dance with me
Come on, dance with me. Baby

I want you, ooh
I want you
And you want me
So why can't we
Get together after the dance

All right, ooh
(Looking girl, saw you smile)
When I first saw you
(Looking good on Soul Train)
You were looking so, so good
(Oh, I was looking, too)
Oh, I was looking at you
(Sweet and so fine)
Sweet and so fine
(Freak that she was)
What a freak thing
(Tantalizing)

And I thought to myself
(Ooh, on the floor)
She was so into her space
(She started to dance, would she)
So caught up in the time and the place
And I wondered would she want me
(Ah, wonder if she, she'd go for me)
If she knows what she needs is me

Oh, yeah
(Talk while we play records, girl)
We could play so, so sweet
(Look so fine, move next to me)
Come on over. Baby, move closer to me
(Your brown eyes, love for a while)
I love your smile, stay a while
Oh, Baby (I just got flashes)
I feel something (That you're wanting me)
Something in me

Oh, nobody else, girl
They'll be talking all night
(Can we leave sweet love. Baby)
Why did the morning come so soon
Love don't need time (Girl)
To make up its mind
(Satisfy) That's how I feel
(All the love inside of me. Baby)
How could you, Baby
(What you gonna do)

// Is Anybody Thinking About Their Living? //

You know, I hear this is going out
Of the album, all over the side to the b-side, to the outer side, you know?
This is a strange thing, let's see what happens

Making light
Yo mum said, if you didn't understand it
You could take your time and try gettin' it right
Now baby, dance, step a little closer
You've got to feel it, so baby, let it move
You take a little time, you get out, now
Now, don't you know you sure won't be no fool?
Can't help it
The reason is because, you see, we're nice
But are on the road to life, you longing
You'll find a better time, take advice
Now work it out, friends understand
The groove is 'cause you want to make it right
You shakers huff or puffin' all your troubles
Get in the move and, and start tonight
I see myself and though you must believe
And take a little hint from [?]
Just let your hips-a loose and start to move
