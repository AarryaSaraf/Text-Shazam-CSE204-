Coming to America, now it's coming to me
I'm not regular, a descendant of kings
Channel my father while I was speaking to you
Vision manifest speak it until it's true
Can't go to sleep, too busy living a dream
Not by myself, too busy building a team
Play with Magic just like my name was Kareem
I'm your majesty, roses under my feet, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my...

Big king, the ruler, smoke for intruder
Palace here in Dallas, the crib like Zamunda
You see we moving, I teach a student
Reach for the peak, elite how we do it for royalty
We teach peace love kindness and loyalty
Roots they run deeper than embroidery
Groomed for greatness accordingly
Legacy the story, we manifest who we wanna be
Obstacles in front of me, jump up and conquer
We the winner not the nominee, I'm not anomaly
Everyone can do it with hard work and honesty
When you reach the top just bring up the company

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my...


I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Wear a lot of gold, but I get a lot of green
Looking at the board, I'm the most important piece
'Cause you can't win the game if you ain't got me
Girl from the hood, and I want a Hakeem
We can't keep it low 'cause we both high key
Popping in the palace and popping in the streets
And my crown might tilt, but it ain't falling

Look at the gold medals, sit down you should know better
Drive the Rolls Royce through the red rose petals
Run my bath water, run a kingdom, run it smarter
Leave a legacy for my future grand daughters

I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Can't nothing move if they ain't got me
I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Give me what I want, yeah give me everything

I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Can't nothing move if they ain't got me
I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Give me what I want, yeah give me everything


I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my...

That's for all my young kings out there
Remember to walk like a king
Remember to talk like a king
And remember to dream like a king!
'Cause you come for royalty

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my...
