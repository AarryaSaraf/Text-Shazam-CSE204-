Aye, It's the Hot Girl Coach and BTS

Smooth like butter
Like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble
Breakin' into your heart like that

Cool shade stunner
Yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer
Yeah, I'm makin' you sweat like that

Break it down

Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow so (oooooh)
Do the boogie like

Side step right left to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step right left to my beat (ahem)
Get it, let it roll

Aye

So smooth like the car I ride
Even ya best party planner couldn't catch this vibe
Big boss and I make a hater stay on they job
And I be on these girls' necks like the back of they bobs

Houston's finest in the room with bosses (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Make 'em all get ratchet in they suits and blouses
I remember writing flows in my room in college
Now I need global entry to the shows I'm rocking

Smooth like cocoa butter
My drip more than a puddle
They know that I'm the wave
Take over every summer
They must be giving Stevie if they ever had to Wonder
'Cause every beat I get on get turned in to Hubba Bubba

Side step right left to my beat (yuh, yuh, yuh)
High like the moon, rock with me, baby (woah, woah, woah)
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (yuh, yuh, yuh)
Side step right left to my beat
Get it, let it roll (bruh, bruh, bruh)

Get it, let it roll
Get it, let it roll

(No) Ice on my wrist
I'm that nice guy
Got that right body and that right mind
Rollin' up to party, got the right vibe
Smooth like (Butter)
Hate us (Love us)

Fresh boy pull up and we lay low
All the playas get movin' when the bass low (woah)
Got ARMY right behind us when we say so 
Let's go

Side step, right, left to my beat (Right, left to my beat)
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap (You know that talk is cheap)
Side step right left to my beat
