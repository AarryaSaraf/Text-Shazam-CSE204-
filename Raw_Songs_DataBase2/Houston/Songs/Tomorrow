Jesus said
"Here I stand, won't you please take my hand?"
And you said
"I will tomorrow"
Jesus said
"I am he who supplies all your needs"
And you said
"I know, but tomorrow, ooh, tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, but it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late

Jesus said
"Here I stand, won't you please let me in?"
And you said
"I will (I will) tomorrow (Tomorrow)"
Jesus said
"I am he who supplies all your needs (All your needs)"
And you said
"I know, but tomorrow, ooh, ah, tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today
But it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late

And who said (Who said)
That tomorrow would ever come for you (Would ever come)
Still, you laugh and play and continue on to say

"Tomorrow, I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today, but it's so much easier to say"
Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow?
You better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be too late
