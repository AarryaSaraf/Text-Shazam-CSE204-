To all the lovers in the place (Lovers in the place)
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you
To all the haters in the place (Haters in the place)
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you

It's been a long crazy week, all I want is a little time
Raise my hands, move my feet, let it go tonight
Leave the stress at home, tell the driver "go"
You ain't gonna kill my vibe, oh no
I look at you, you look at me, you already know
What I want, what I need, is you and me on the floor
I can feel your love when our bodies touch
If anyone is feelin' like me tonight

Now throw your hands up
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers
(You know it, you know it)
Baby, stand up
If you're single but you're looking for another
(You know it, you know it)
Ladies, tell your man you love 'em (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Fellas, tell your girl you love her (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
So throw your hands up
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers (About the lovers)

Thinkin' about the ones that are looking down on you and me
Lovers in together now, now I'm completely free
Life is way too short, you might as well get yours
Lord knows, I'm doin' me

So all the lovers in the place, ahh
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you
To all the haters in the place
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you (Come on)

Now throw your hands up (Oh, oh, oh)
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers
(You know it, you know it)
Baby, stand up (Stand up)
If you're single but you're looking for another (Come on, come on)
(You know it, you know it)
Ladies, tell your men you love 'em (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Fellas, tell your girl you love her (Tell 'em that you love her)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
So throw your hands up
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers (About the lovers)

And if your lover ain't around
That don't mean you can't get down (You know it, you know it)
(Alright, come on, hey)
And if you came here all alone
Find someone and hold 'em close (Alright, yeah)
(You know it, you know it)

So throw your hands up, yeah
And baby, let me see you stand up, oh
And if you're single, it don't matter, no
'Cause this song is for everyone who believes in love

Now throw your hands up (Ooh, ooh)
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers (Yeah)
(You know it, you know it)
Baby, stand up (Yeah, come on)
If you're single but you're looking for another (Yeah)
(You know it, you know it)
Ladies, tell your men you love 'em (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(It's about the lovers)
Fellas, tell your girl you love her (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
So throw your hands up (Throw your hands up)
For the next three minutes, it's about the lovers (About the lovers)

To all the lovers in the place (Lovers in the place)
This song is for you, baby
This song is for you (It's about the lovers)
To all the haters in the place (Haters in the place)
I ain't singin' to you, baby
I ain't singin' to you, you, you, you
