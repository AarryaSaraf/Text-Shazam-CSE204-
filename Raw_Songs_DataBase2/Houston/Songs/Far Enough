Are we goin' far enough
Far enough
Far enough for love?
Are we goin' deep enough?
Are you real enough?
Can you feel enough for love?

Everything I say
Everything I do
From my heart
But there's so much more inside
We both try to hide
We've got to open up

I'm gonna give you all my love
Baby, I ain't holdin' nothin' back from you
I'm gonna give you all my love
I got even more to show you
More than you know

Are we goin' far enough
Far enough
Far enough for love?
Are we reaching deep enough?
Can you feel enough?
Are you real enough for love?

When I hold you close
Do I get the most
Out of you?
Do you know how to fly?
Reach up to the sky
That's what we've gotta do

I'm gonna give you all my love
I want to go the distance all my life with you
I'm gonna give you all my love
I got even more to show you
But I got to get to know you

Are we goin' far enough?
Really far enough?
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh yeah

I'm gonna give you all my love
We're on that roller-coaster ride you've waited for
All my love, baby
Heart-to-heart and soul-to-soul
We're gonna get it right

Are we goin' far enough
Far enough
Far enough for love?
Are we goin' deep enough, my baby?
Are you real enough?
Can you feel enough for love?

What's going on?
I need to know
Please, please tell me
Tell me, where do you want to go?
I wanna know
If you let me, I'll take you to a place
You've never been before, heh
And I promise you I'll leave you
I'll leave you wanting so much more

You'll cry for mercy
You'll scream for mercy
You'll cry for mercy, mercy, mercy
Marvin said it
Hey, Marvin said it
Mercy, mercy, ooh
