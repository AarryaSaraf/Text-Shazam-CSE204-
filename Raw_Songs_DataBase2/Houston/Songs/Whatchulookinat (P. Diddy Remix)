You ready?
It's time for you to speak up
Bad Boy, baby
Whitney Houston
Why you lookin' at me?
As we proceed

Don't get mad at me 'cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me
You've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

See, I don't understand why you keep peepin' me
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man
Don't think you're stressin' me
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no, no

Never thought (Never thought, never thought)
Never knew (Never knew that you) that you would do this to me (Do this to me)
Tried to ruin me (Ruin me), you're my enemy (You're the enemy)
Never thought (Never thought, never thought)
That you (That you) would act as if you're cool with me
(So why you lookin' at me?)
Why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad)
'Cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me
You've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

Oh, you know you're wrong
Don't wanna respect my song
But it's okay 'cause either way
My diamond ring is real strong
You try to show the whole world what I do
But now I'm turnin' the cameras back on you
The same spotlight that once gave me fame
Tryin' to dirty up Whitney's name, no, no

Never thought (Never thought, never thought, never thought)
Never knew (Never knew that you) that you would do this to me (Do this to me)
Tried to ruin me (Tried to ruin me), you're my enemy (You're the enemy)
Never thought (Never thought, never thought, never thought)
That you (That you) would act as if you're cool with me
(Why you lookin' at me, oh)
Why you lookin' at me? (Oh...oh...)

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me
(I'm still gonna be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me (I feel your eyes)
You've been tellin' lies on me (You've been tellin' lies on me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

Messin' with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Try to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facin'
Oh, you know you need to stop it
Teeth into my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you lookin' at me

Houston, we have a problem
Yo, turn me up, ha
I can't get mad if you look at me (Yeah)
'Cause on the real, look at me
Y'all don't know what it took for me or what it took to be
On top from where the hook in me
I'm public enemy number one, you've been warned
I'm victory in the human form
It's only wise that you move along
Bad Boy, yeah, we move the song
Think not, prove me wrong
Too many dudes wanna earn a rep
S. Combs and I earn respect
That's the difference, the trick is I'm hard to manage
The only ones that can judge me is God or Janice (I love you mama)
It's the man that won't stop, the girl that won't quit (That's right)
Diddy, Whitney, it's an instant hit
Yeah, Bad Boy
(Why you lookin' at me?)
Yeah, let's go

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me (Still gon' be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me (Feel your eyes)
You've been tellin' lies on me (You're tellin' lies, lies, lies)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

I'm only human, feel me? I'm just like you
I'ma make mistakes, too
God's child
I like this right here
Whitney Houston
Why you lookin' at me?
We love you
