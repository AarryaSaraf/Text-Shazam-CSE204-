(Tells me, tells me)

Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (tells me so)
So (tells me so)

Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak but He is strong

Yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me (loves me so)
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (tells me so), so glad

Pressing on the upward way
Always guide me, Lord, I pray
Undeserving, and stubborn-willed
Never fail to love me still

Yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me (loves me)
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (loves me so, and I know)
(Loves me)
Yes, Jesus loves me (loves me, loves me, loves me), loves
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so

(I know I am loved)
For the Bible tells me so
(Feels so good to know)
Ooh, that I'm never alone
See, sometimes I'm lonely but never alone, no
For the Bible tells, for the Bible tells
For the Bible, oh Lord, it tells me so (tells me so), so glad (tells me so)

See, I know that He loves me, yeah (tells me so)
Whether I'm right, mm (tells me so)
And whether I'm wrong, oh yes, He did (tells me so)
Oh the Bible tells me, me (tells me so)
Jesus loves me
