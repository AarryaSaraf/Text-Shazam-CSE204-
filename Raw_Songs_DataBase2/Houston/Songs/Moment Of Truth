Ah, ah, uh, yeah
Baby, ooh, yeah

We've been playing games with our emotions
Let's get what we feel out in the open

Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth, yeah yeah yeah

Far too many times a heart gets broken
Just because three words are never spoken

We can't let that bother us
Not when we're so much in love
I could never get enough of saying, I love you

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth

Yeah, yeah, baby, ooh
Wanting you is all I do
Boy, I know you want me, too
Don't you think, it's time we proved
What we've been feeling

This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real, soon enough
Let out your feelings tonight
'Cause oh, I know that I want you
It's all up to me and you
And the moment of truth
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(This is our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
(Oh, yes it is)
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(Our moment, our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
This is our moment of truth
Either we win or we lose this love
(Our moment of truth)
It's just the way that we feel
We'll know if love is for real
