Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh yeah

Well, everybody's been so uptight
And forgetting to live the life
Let all the problems get them down
Till they make you wanna shout (Oh yeah)
See, everybody's been down on luck (Yeah)
Now finally things are looking up (Oh yeah)
The sun has chased all the rain away
No more obstacles in our way

Now, it's time to celebrate (Come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (That's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (Because it's all right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)
I celebrate you

Listen
There is oh so many of us that (Underestimate the power of love)
So much hate going 'round and I've had enough
I'm inviting you to fall in love
Though we been going through changes
Just trying to make it from day to day
Tonight don't you worry about a thing
Just cast your cares away

Now, it's time to celebrate (Come on, yeah)
Come on and celebrate (It's what I want)
I wanna celebrate (It's time to celebrate)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you, yeah)
I celebrate you
It's time to celebrate (Come on, come on)
Come on and celebrate (Don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (Tonight, everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, I celebrate you

I'm gonna give you a reason
Why you should clap your hands and jump for joy
There's something we can believe in
Now that the rain is gone, we're gonna dance on a rainbow
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

It's time to celebrate (Come on)
Come on and celebrate (Time to celebrate)
I wanna celebrate (Because it's so right)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you)
Celebrate me, celebrate me

It's time to celebrate (Time to bring you and me, baby)
Come on and celebrate (Don't matter what color you are)
I wanna celebrate (Tonight everyone is a star)
I celebrate you, you celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (It's time to celebrate)
Come on and celebrate
I wanna celebrate (Come on, come on)
I celebrate you, you celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (Celebrate)
Come on and celebrate (Clap your hands)
I wanna celebrate (Clap your hands)
I celebrate you (I celebrate you)
Celebrate me
'Cause it's time to celebrate (Come on, come on, come on)
Come on and celebrate (Come on, come, on)
I wanna celebrate

We love you Whitney!
