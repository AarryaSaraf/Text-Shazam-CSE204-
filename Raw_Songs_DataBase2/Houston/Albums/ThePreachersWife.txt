// I Believe In You And Me //

I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one
For me
Oh yes, you will

I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love, oh, you know I love you, boy
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no-one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see?
That I believe in you and me

Well, maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
And love is the miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
Oh, darling
I believe in you and me
See, I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

// Step By Step //

Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross
As I'm going on my journey

Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)

And this old road is rough and ruined
So many dangers along the way
So many burdens might fall upon me
So many troubles that I have to face

Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me
Oh, I won't let my spirit go
Until I get to my destination
I'm going to take it slowly because I'm making it mine

I know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you

// I Go To The Rock //

Where do I go?
When there's nobody else to turn to
Who do I talk to?
When nobody wants to listen
Who do I lean on? Oh
When there is no foundation stable
I go to the rock
I know he is able, I go to the rock

I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain he stands by me
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter I go to the rock

Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening
Who do I turn to when those winds of sorrow blow
And is there a refuge in the time of tribulation
Go to the rock, I know he is able
I go to the rock

I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain he stands by me
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter I go to the rock

I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain he stands by me
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand
When I need a shelter I go to the rock

I go the rock when I need a friend
I can go to the rock
I go to the rock when I need a shelter
You can go to the rock
You can go to the rock
You can go to the rock
I can go
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock
I can go to the rock
I can go, I can go to the rock
I can go when I need some shelter
When I need a friend
I can go

And when the Earth around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I stand I can stand
When I need a friend
I go to the rock
I can go to the rock
Hey hey hey oh yeah

Bigger than the brightest smile
And longer than the longest mile

Somebody bigger than the biggest fight
And darker than the darkest night

Somebody bigger than you and I
Bigger than you and I

He lights the way when road is alone
Keeps me company with love to guide you
He walks beside you just like he walks with me

When I am weary, and filled with despair
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there
And who gives me faith
I will never, never, never, never, never doubt
Somebody bigger yeah

// You Were Loved //

We all want to make a place in this world
We all want to our voices to be heard
Every one wants a chance to be someone
We all have dreams we need to dream
Sweeter than any star you can reach
Because when you reach and find, you've found someone
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing
The greatest gift this life can bring
Is when you look back and know
You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (mm)
You were loved (yes you were)

You can have diamonds in your hands
Have all the riches in the land
But, without love
You don't really have a thing, no no
When somebody cares that you're alive
When somebody trusts you with their life
That's when you'll know (huh)
That you have all you need
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift
The finest treasure that there is
You can look back and know
You were loved

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (mm)
Yes, you were loved (yes you were now)

So many roads that you can take
Whatever way you go
Don't take that road alone
It's better you should know

You were loved by someone
Touched by someone
Held by someone
Meant something to someone
Loved somebody
Touched somebody's heart
Along the way
You can look back and say (mm)
You did okay
You were loved

So remember to tell that special one (yeah, mm)
You were loved
You were loved
You were loved
You were loved
Hey hey hey hey hey

// My Heart Is Calling //

Who would've thought of it
That I might feel like this
Some kind of wonderful
There's nothing quite comparable
The thing about it is
It's oh so innocent
I wasn't looking for
It came knocking at my door
I'm trying to do things right
But I'm about to lose this fight
Because spending time with you
Well, it feels so good and that's the truth

And every day with you
I swear it brings me closer
To my only reservation is you
My sweet temptation, baby

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

Who could imagine it
I found my happiness
In someone I barely know
And I like to take it slow
But you're so different, boy
You're breaking all my rules
What is it in your smile
That makes me feel the way I do
I'm trying to live my life
And I'm trying to live it right
If I desire you
It ain't because I'm trying to

Boy, everyday with you
I swear it brings me closer to
My only reservation is you
My sweet temptation, baby

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

I've given it consideration uh huh
And it all adds up to you
I won't deny this heart is calling for you, baby
I've given it a lot of thought uh huh
And it all ends up on you
My sweet temptation
God knows I'm falling for you

Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you
Oh, my heart is calling
I'm falling for you

Is is in your smile, boy
Is it touch, baby
I don't know why

// I Believe In You And Me (Single Version) //

I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be in love eternally
Well, as far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh, yes you will
And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down, baby
Then I will always be around
Just to be right where you are, my love
You know I love you, boy
I will never leave you out
I will always let you in, boy
Oh, baby, to places no one's ever been
Deep inside can't you see
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool to feel the way I do
But I would be the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
And love is a miracle
And baby, yes, you're a dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
Oh, baby, 'cause I believe
I do believe
I believe in you and me
See I was lost, now I'm free
'Cause I believe in you and me

Believe in you and me

// The Lord Is My Shepherd //

The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
He makes me to lie down
In green pastures
He leadeth me beside the still waters
Ooh, He restores my soul
He restores my soul
He restores my soul
He restores my soul
Thank you Lord
I wanna thank you
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness
E'en for His name's sake
Yea, tho I walk thru valley of shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For thou art with me
Thy rod and thy staff
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
And you comfort me
(Thank you Lord)
He prepareth a table before me
In the presence of my enemies
My anoint my head with oil
And my cup overflows
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me all the days of my life
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Amen
(Wonderful conselour
Prince of peace
Mighty good shepherd
I love you Lord)
