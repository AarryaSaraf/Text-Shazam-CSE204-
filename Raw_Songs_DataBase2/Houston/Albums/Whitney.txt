// I Wanna Dance With Somebody //

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooo, somebody ooo
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooo, somebody ooo
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance with me baby
Don't ya wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance

// Just The Lonely Talking Again //

It's the second time around
For you and I, boy
And believe me it's confusing me
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "all's forgiven"
But something tells me I'm headed for heartbreak
So darling, please, I'm praying that
This time it will be different
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize

Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again

Now, the time before
When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

So baby, please, please tell me now
That when I fulfill your needs
You won't up and leave me
Even though you know I'll let you come back
Tell me

Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again
Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again

// Love Will Save The Day //

Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day

When your world's falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on, my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep because your problems are too deep
And there's always something getting in the way
And when you turn on the evening news
Mass confusion is the only thing you see
Well, there's no question
That we need a new direction
Because we all could use some peace and harmony

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
Love is going to save the day
You've got to believe it

// Didn't We Almost Have It All //

Remember when we held on in the rain
The night we almost lost it
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?

Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Because once you know what love is
You never let it end

Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The night we hold on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all?
Didn't we almost have it all?

// So Emotional //

I don't know why I like it
I just do

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk
I just watch your mouth

I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

See I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much

I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do?

// Where You Are //

I saw the news this morning
Saw your face across the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
(I can't stop thinking about you)
I hopped into a taxi, seemed
In a moment I was home, home again

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

Tossing and turning in my sleep
I can't make it without you, now
I'm going to take the next plane out
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or how far
Or then if you're a star
I know I should be there where you are

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are

// Love Is A Contact Sport //

Contact contact
Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah

You've been avoiding me
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog
I never see ya shine
You're as cold as the London fog
You claim you want my love
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch
You better come out of your cave

It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it
Love's electric
Turn me on and see

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you want to do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you want to play the game
So grab my hand, slam!

I hate to sound aggressive
But I'm tired of waiting for your move
Cut the formalities
'Cause you've got a few things to prove
If you really want my love
I need to feel it down deep from within
Don't make me wait too long
I'm ready now come and stroke my skin

Well all this talking
Worthless chatter just don't matter
Time for stalkin'
Come get next to me

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you want to do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you want to play the game
So grab my hand, slam!

Hey boy
Why don't you come on over
So we can make that contact
Contact you dare

It's so perplexing
Why you fight it won't you try it
Love's electric
Turn me on you'll see
Contact!

Love is a contact sport
You gotta move in time
If you want to do it right
Here I am
Love is a contact sport
You gotta act untamed
If you want to play the game
So grab my hand, slam!

// You're Still My Man //

On the day that you left me
You said you had no regrets
There's a bond between us
That hasn't been broken yet
And the feelings between us
Will never disappear
How can you be far away
When your spirits here

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

And the seasons of our love
Will always change I know
Maybe that's the reason
You felt you had to go
But soon you'll be missing me
Darling, I know you well
There's a magic we share together
And no one can break that spell

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

I'll wait for you
The thought that keeps me going each day
Is I believe you still love me
I love you more than words can say

You're still my man
Nothing can change it
We still belong together
You're still my man
Nothing can change it
Our love will last forever

// For The Love Of You //

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
Loving you
Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long
Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon slowly coming into view

I want to be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the morning comes
Feels good to me
My loving me, yeah
Smoother then a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh baby
Love to be
Riding the waves of love enchanted with your touch
It seems to me
We can sail together in and out of mystery

I want to be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you

Paradise, I have to think, can't feel as secure again
You're the key
And this I see
Now and then I lose my way
Confusing words to try and say what I feel
Yeah, your love is real
I might as well, sign my name on a card that's been saying better
See, time will tell
Because it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

I want to be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you

// Where Do Broken Hearts Go //

I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see
I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only thing
I learned
Is that I need you desperately

So here I am
And can you please tell me

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh baby

I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

So here I am
And can you please tell me

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know

Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me

// I Know Him So Well //

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments
Who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know
I know him well

Wasn't it good
Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end
He needs a little more than before

Security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide

Looking back
I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it good (oh, so good)
Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart

Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end
He needs a little more than before

Security
He needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took some to understand him
Hoo, ooh
I know him so well
