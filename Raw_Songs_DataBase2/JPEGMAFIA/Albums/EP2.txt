Album: EP2

// LAST DANCE! //

On the rebound
When I walk in
I'ma reload
Hittin' big gas
I'm Rodman

Glock-19
My side bitch
When I speak to a pig
I'm Biden
Before I let you get to me get violent
Niggas never let me be
It's common
In Bmore I be mobbin' like diamond
Crime mob goin' in circles around the block 'fore I find him (Wait)
I found the beat
Duckin' these crackers
I feel like Bin Laden
I wish that my bitches
Had better timin'
Some of y'all niggas
Was better off silent
Killin' yourselves
This ain't even Love Island
Trust fund money can't buy 'em (Poof)
He left the critics behind him
Features with Issas
I'm distant with Molly's (Solid)
It's like Kojima designed me
Slutz with the gear
And the metal is on me
Switching like ipkiss
Can somebody stop me
One on one
I be flexing like Kyla (Bitch)
Fuck with me and I'ma employ the Tommy
Are you triggered or just weak be design?
Baby, my presence is fine
Girl, are you really in line?
Decade three but one hand on the nine
Keep it fluid, I be marching with dimes
Zero mods and you niggas still dyin'
I don't need one (Bah, bah)
One wish
Ray J with the signs
Hit it first, I'm ahead of my time
Spit in her ass, she nurture my mind
Super head, Mr. Marcus, I'm dyin'
Stash money and prepare for decline (Aye)
Hunting for mine
Now they got me
Speedin' down the lane like Plies
Spitting like grand theft
Be on auto when I slide
Praying for a wave
But Peggy changing up the tide
Niggas stay mad
So they pray on my demise
Twerkin' on stage
Feel like Mary J. Blidge
Since I bought a Glock
No more drama in my life
Baby, when I do it
I'ma (Uh)
Baby, when I do it
Bet I won't say shit like like
Clyde
Dressed for the kill
With my Bonnie on my side
(Huh, shit, shit, shit, shit)
(Shit, shit, shit, shit)
(Shit)

// INTRO! //

Said, "Baby, it's all"
And we're way on
Say, "We'll all be feelin', we'll all be feelin', can you feel?"
I'm so sad to be such a negative, a negative refugee
This, uh, uh

At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys so make-believe
Shoutout my refugees, your fans just, uh

// FIX URSELF! //

Oh, rub it, baby, oh, rub it baby
Ooh, rub it, oh, rub it, baby, oh, rub it baby
Oh, rub it, baby, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yes

I'm all alone, I'm at my best
Talkin' that shit, come take my breath
Fake love's what their fantasy says
They always bury the best (Uh)
My success, count up all of my eggs
Stay on God when I move through TECs (Let's go)
Tell me why you hate me (Huh)
You ain't making' no profit
Somebody can't get to the bag (Damn, damn, damn), sad (Shh)
What is you doin', boy?
How is you tryna make it with no talent or cash? (For real)
2020, niggas out here with no clue, no plan and no mask
Damn

I went from nothin' to sluttin', it wasn't easy, babe
Shoutout my bitch and my husband, I love y'all equally
Every mornin' I body shame, I can't stand my face
At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys told make believe
Shoutout my refugees, my fans my family

It's so tragic, baby, who provided for you?
You ain't got nothin' for me, cut that bitch out my story, woah
Who the best? (Pssh) Took a reduction and made a mess (Yeah)
Kid greedy, you a Sudafed
I'll let you bitch niggas do the rest
I love my baby like Trump loves Putin, in the deepest way (Yeah)
My baby's barely scratch the surface, there's a deeper state (Yeah)
Even though you tried to give me top when I was not awake (Huh?)
I know that nigga ain't in the ground but he still dead to me
She's still obsessed with me, it's real

There's no need to fill a void when your past ain't fake
Shoutout my bitch and my husband, y'all get here equally
Momma told me, "Shoot for the stars," so I aim that way
At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys told make believe
Shoutout my refugees, my fans my family

I'm way, I'm-I'm way too real for this shit
You niggas gotta get censors
See, you gotta get censors 'cause they're gonna fuck around and ruin a nigga life
(You know I'm ready) Puss, all of ya
You know I'm ready, y'all make me mad stressed (Yeah, yeah)
I'm really black out here and y'all just performin'
Nobody wants you and you can't absorb it
I can't be scared of me, my bitch is so gorgeous (Ah-ah)

At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade (Yeah)
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way (Yeah)
It's so sad to me (For real), these boys told make believe (Oh yeah)
Shoutout my refugees (Let's go), my fans my family (Pssh), huh

Nasty, real nasty

// KELTEC! //

(Health.va.gov)
Send a person, baby, send her
Send her over, baby, ready
Send her over, come and find me my boo (Same old, same old)
Baby
Oh, I wanna fly, see you 'round (Uh)

I don't need industry praise
Vision distorted, you niggas survivin' off co-signs
Know my credit, keep lockin' the stage
Niggas mad 'cause I'm Black and I'm hostile
Crackers salty, I'm pretty and paid
Bottom bitch wanna jump on the dogpile
Every night I be fannin' the flames
Mentally not a fan of your games
They wanna produce on my aisle
'Cause they know that the market is mean
Niggas will shark your whole style
Hope you're ready to drown for the team
Shaq Fu, you can't stop this reign
I can't believe that my talent brought fame
You can't believe I created a lane
I don't respond to bitch niggas by name, that's trash (Facts)
Scary-ass backpack rappin' niggas never was meant to outlast me
Me and my Kimber like Lana and Lashley, uh
Keep it draped in attachments, uh
Nine on me, I'm sassy
Tatiana when I'm at the crib
With the Smith on me, call it Ashley
Mary Kate, is my Glock in the backseat?
808, watch me peak and attack 'em
All of this talk, my niggas yell, "Action"
How did I catch you lackin'?
When you got no money, I'm laughin'
I'm talkin' minimum wage
Rappers can't do what I do 'cause I own all my shit
And I do all my shit and most y'all can't relate
When Peggy hop in the booth, he get paid
You hit the booth, bitch, you know you a slave
You know what you signed, you know you don't save
You know you a dub, I'm easing the pain
All of my haters are tame
Naysayers, bench players, even all of the coaches between
Peggy Lavar, going back to my roots
Jah bless, now I feel like The Fiend
Mask off in the future foreseen
Mask on, I don't wanna be seen
.PNG, get your quality up
JPEG, I compress all my schemes (Ah)
I put your dome in a beam (Ah)
Kimber tucked in-between
I ain't been shootin' straight since a teen
Hop on the fence and I lean
How is this pussy still runnin' the scene?
What does this actually mean?
Baby, control your demeanor
Niggas don't have to believe (Yeah)
Bet when it happens, like, uh
Bet when it happens, they tweet, ha
(What will that article read?)

It's nasty
(What's up, baby? What's up?)
Say somethin' (Yeah)
All representatives are assisting other veterans
Your call will be answered in the order it was received

// THIS ONES FOR US! //

Yo
Yo, you good?
Everything about JPEGs I like
Yeah, yeah

All of my babies is active
All my money out the bank
Pretty thot, make her put the cash in the mattress
I don't be sendin' them nothing (Ooh)
Straight slut with the flashing (Ooh)
Niggas can tell that you frontin' (Truth), duff man
Every episode, I'm sippin', I feel so disgusted
Piss drunk, thinking 'bout how niggas jealous of me when I loved 'em (Mm)
Niggas ain't loyal at the function
Ink dry, crackers took the whole pie and gave you a fraction
Cut it out, smut it out, pistol poke if you play with my passion
It's a whole new world but it looks like my map loaded first, y'all lagging (Huh)
White writers wanna paint me as edgy
Can't handle the facts that I'm rapping
Unbelievable, young Jerry Stackhouse
Don't nobody wan' play with me, back out
Fuck your playlist, I do what I want now
Made this beat on a binge with a bust down

Forty five on the Kimber, three holes in the trigger
The new ones got butterflies on 'em now
I think I am a killer, came back from Kuwait and these niggas is looking like targets now
I ain't sippin' no liquor tonight 'cause that Korbel got me feeling broken like Hardy now (Damn)
And you niggas ain't niggas, you just became niggas 'cause niggas is making a profit now (Fake-ass nigga)
White boys scared of the Peg in private, but postin' they black squares now
When you see me, better say it with your chest and you better have a vest 'cause I don't waste rounds (Yeah)
Give a fuck about a check, give a fuck about respect
If the SIG jam, cut it close, lay your body down
702, all I want is a sound
Bombing on you, this the Lyricist Lounge (Ayy)
Twin Kimbers, Prince and his blouse
Lost world when I'm back in the town
Stainless, I brought the raptors out
Bloodhounds, baby, trackin' 'em down
Close or away make you spirited now (Now), yeah

Alright, last chance, enemies end up on last dance
Spinnin' that pussy, go back in, back out
Eating ass, feel like Pac-Man
Rich and bitter, Black Batman
Industry don't wanna back him
It's alright though, still successful
Government still wanna threaten you
All guns still registered, mhm
Hipster niggas, so regular, up in Williamsburg, lookin' hella dumb (Fact)
I used to try to be nice to 'em, now I just know that they jealous of me
Faded all of my DMs (Yeah), apologize then delete 'em
Crackers threatened not to cover me
Whole staff white, ain't no colorin'
Must be a cab night, Eric Sundermann
Ayy, you and Andy Cohn just smotherin' women
You threaten my money, I'm snatchin' your spirit
That's why I feel nothing for none of you bitches
Leaders is rapists, rest of y'all suspicious
That liberal arts degree really ain't hitting
Fuck it, time to hit Tacombi, do dishes
Your boss is a rapist, what did I do? I missed it
Black, beautiful, and damn, I'm gifted
You being white just got you that position
You not with the shits, you not that good at business
You vague with your threats, I'm direct with my pistol

// PANIC ROOM! //

It's alright

Get to work with the Chucks, yeah, Mr. Miyag'
Put your worth on my box, I'm catching a bod'
We do it, we slide, exit pits on the stop (Cool)
We cuttin' a cop, yeah, bitch, I'm the don dada
My papa's a zombie, when I tour I feel like Booty Talk 17
I been walking dead for too long, for too many seasons
Niggas be buggin' at Peggy too raw for too many reasons
I'm just trying to get a bag (Facts)
Rappers in this industry, creatively in hand (Damn)
When I scream, I crack a hottie, shake another dance (Sheesh)
Shake my head at night for hours, start working on my stances
Kegels, gotta keep this pussy tight
This passion inside got no sequels, Peggy fine, no equals
I'm runnin' through these masters to find a beat as good as people
Give that bitch an elbow
How Peggy only five-nine with sticks as big as diesel?
My puppies told me feed you, these poor dogs, they gon' eat you
All doggies die at point range, this flick ain't got no sequel
You choke like Key and Peele do
Banana clips gon' peel you
Monkey business to major move
Put him in the sky where the angels groove
Sucka-ass nigga, I ain't playin' with you
Damn, boy, who claimin' you?
Why your niggas ain't stay with you?
Must stay caught up with the Zoom
Got these niggas lookin' like panic room
Yeah, I got these niggas lookin' like panic room, yeah

Okay, karma is a funny bitch, she gonna find you and
All the things you said ran through my head like t.A.T.u. and
You ain't gotta act like you ain't scared, get comfortable
No, I don't want your consent, nigga I'ma pull this dick on you
No, we ain't gon' work it out, ho, do I look like Stacker 2?
If he do me wrong, I catch your man then he responsible
Take two, De La Soul, roll on by and scrape you, ha
That's for thinking that we was cool, ha (Brrt)
Caught this nigga without a tool, huh
Baby, you're looking like a fool, hm

// FEED HER! //

I'm at the crib with no money, no bitch and no guns, boy, what is you doin' with me?
I be looking at these children like, "What is you doin'?" It must be the boomer in me
Words pop out these niggas, yes, I know they pussy as fuck and we never gon' meet
Your beats like my Kimber, the shit never jam, nigga, I'm used to the heat (Facts)
These niggas don't know how to score, they just setting the screen
Fuck what you do for the others, boy, what is you doing for me?
How do I stay in your mind, lil' bitch, and we still ain't meet?
My bitch same color as Dave East
I put pause on a nigga like me
I spit bars like I never get sleep
How did I move in your mind rent-free?
Huh, taxing a lease, I think I'm Prince Ali
You minimum wage, I'm Prince Hakeem
It's dirty, you alt-right trolls ain't worthy
I stay in your mind, it's workin' (Uh)
You have no worth, it's hurtin'
Don't know any niggas in person (Nah)
Never step outside, just lurkin' (Ooh, ooh-yeah)

Oh, that's you, I be for certain
My Kimber my main bitch, but, yeah, me and my Glock be flirtin'
Be careful where you stay, I left my prints, stay nervous
Stand back, stand by, stay learning, uh
When one of these crackers get brave and I put Kimbers to their face
Y'all better thank me for my service
My world different, I'm Kyrie Irving
Niggas be bitchin', they have no purpose
Testing my patience, I'm going to search you
Running a clinic and feeding the nurses
Miracle bars, you wrapping a turban
Noble savage, I'm Maria Minerva
Baby, I feel like a servant
It's not like I don't deserve it
Patience, trust, gotta earn it
Grab my baby, came back to this curvy
I feel as dripped and I'm nervous
How, how
How it feels when I bring up your memory
Ooh, you feelin' me now, keep callin' me from his house
The pressure on pile, all these sticks, I just can't put it down
Now I hear 'bout my name in your mouth
All that money, he still on my couch
What that smell like? Bars
I'm a thot that was never in doubt
They love me 'cause I spin on them messy
They fuck you 'cause you giving them clout
Fuck a girl, make a beat on my couch
On the road to some riches, I'm laughing
'Cause I keep running into your- (Uh)
How I keep running into your exes?
I keep texting, know she get the message
Feed her
