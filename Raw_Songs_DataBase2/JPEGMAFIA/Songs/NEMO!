You think you know me
Hm
Hm

Downtown shawty, poke your ass out
Only settin' niggas up, I don't back down
Black and rollin' 'round with that K out
Every time I look down, I'm clean
Yeah, got it all lean
Big Gat', bail bonds and wrist slap
I seen niggas try to dodge all this new tech

Buh, huh, buh, buh, buh
Fuckin' your bitch like I'm back from the war (Ayy)
Fuckin' your bitch, I'm goin' on tour
Fuckin' the head of my best
I won't go in the ocean like Nemo, send shots at the floor
We can't relate, bitch, I was poor
Empty the safe, money on floor

All of my songs are diss (Facts)
I might just ghostwrite a hit
They know that's money well-spent, yeah, yeah (You fixed your pussy?)
Hol' up, fuck, nigga did homework, what?
You gon' keep pushing' your luck
If I aim for your head, better hope that you duck

Buh, frr, buh, buh, buh
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm back from the war (Yeah)
Fuckin' your bitch like I'm back from the tour (Uh)
Fuck on me, baby, you know I'm a whore
I pistol whip 'em so he know that it's war
I ain't even have to show up in court
Droppin' the case, got a drop in the jar, shit

Buh, frr, buh, buh, buh
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm goin' to war (Yeah)
Fuckin' that bitch like I'm back from the tour (Uh)
Fuck on me, baby, you know that he borin'
I feel like they out here to win, I'm just scorin', huh
I can afford it (Yeah)
In the ocean like Dory, these sharks get 'em sorted, nasty
