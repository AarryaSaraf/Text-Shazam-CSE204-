Uh

In the sun, I ain't black enough
Oh, some funds got him acting up?
Nigga, jump in the aqueduc
Niggas know that you wack as fuck
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough

Who been putting in minimal pain?
Already showed 'em it's up and it's stuck
Wear my scars, who the fuck is ashamed?
Never me, I'ma keep it a buck
You get charred if you step in my range
So you might as well stay in the cut
I ain't Midas, but stain what I touch
I ain't hiding, I came in to crush, bitch
Who told that black boy had to hate himself?
Who told my sister she ain't worth a cent?
Grin on my face from watching crackers melt
Stand on that shit, boy, I cannot pretend
Niggas ain't spillin' tears when karma dealt
I'm just gon' play a little violin
I ain't gon' water down just for some wealth, bitch

In the sun, I ain't black enough
Oh, some funds got him acting up?
Nigga, jump in the aqueduc
Niggas know that you wack as fuck
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough


Man, they said I ain't black enough, maybe 'cause I don't act enough
Niggas out here be acting tough, I don't put on a act for none
I came through like a glitch in the game (What?), talk my shit and I backed it up
They'll still say I ain't black enough, they'll still say I ain't black enough (Uh)
This won't last, three, four tabs, I get to acting up
Man, this cookout is packed as fuck, with these crackers y'all asked to lunch
That's the beauty of backing it up (What's up?), is my niggas don't ask for nothing?
Rather bring out the Source Awards, (For real), then they hit up a GRAMMY brunch, huh
I know these niggas ain't seein' me, these niggas never believe in me
I know the stakes, I know the real from the fake, opinion from media takes
I'm at a stage, work like it's minimum wage, for money and critical praise
Fuck out the way, you better watch what you say
Your black life won't matter today, nigga


Black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough
In the sun, I ain't black, black, black, black, black, black enough

(Dah, dah, dah-dah)
