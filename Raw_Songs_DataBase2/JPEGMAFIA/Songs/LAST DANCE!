On the rebound
When I walk in
I'ma reload
Hittin' big gas
I'm Rodman

Glock-19
My side bitch
When I speak to a pig
I'm Biden
Before I let you get to me get violent
Niggas never let me be
It's common
In Bmore I be mobbin' like diamond
Crime mob goin' in circles around the block 'fore I find him (Wait)
I found the beat
Duckin' these crackers
I feel like Bin Laden
I wish that my bitches
Had better timin'
Some of y'all niggas
Was better off silent
Killin' yourselves
This ain't even Love Island
Trust fund money can't buy 'em (Poof)
He left the critics behind him
Features with Issas
I'm distant with Molly's (Solid)
It's like Kojima designed me
Slutz with the gear
And the metal is on me
Switching like ipkiss
Can somebody stop me
One on one
I be flexing like Kyla (Bitch)
Fuck with me and I'ma employ the Tommy
Are you triggered or just weak be design?
Baby, my presence is fine
Girl, are you really in line?
Decade three but one hand on the nine
Keep it fluid, I be marching with dimes
Zero mods and you niggas still dyin'
I don't need one (Bah, bah)
One wish
Ray J with the signs
Hit it first, I'm ahead of my time
Spit in her ass, she nurture my mind
Super head, Mr. Marcus, I'm dyin'
Stash money and prepare for decline (Aye)
Hunting for mine
Now they got me
Speedin' down the lane like Plies
Spitting like grand theft
Be on auto when I slide
Praying for a wave
But Peggy changing up the tide
Niggas stay mad
So they pray on my demise
Twerkin' on stage
Feel like Mary J. Blidge
Since I bought a Glock
No more drama in my life
Baby, when I do it
I'ma (Uh)
Baby, when I do it
Bet I won't say shit like like
Clyde
Dressed for the kill
With my Bonnie on my side
(Huh, shit, shit, shit, shit)
(Shit, shit, shit, shit)
(Shit)
