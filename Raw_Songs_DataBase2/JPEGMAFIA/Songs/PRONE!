Bullets through the neck and the backbone (Ugh)

One stop turn Steve Bannon into Steve Hawking (Fuck 'em)

Since you be alone, catch this heat alone (Huh)
Fuck, your nigga's home, they gon' be alone
Big '94 leave that nigga prone
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, don't get up)

It's the- Oh

And the trees (The trees)
And the birds (And the bir-)

Oh my God (Oh my God)
And the - Ooh
Somebody, she's a beauty
A beauty, a beauty
Very special
