Risk, risk, risk
Risk, risk, risk (Ah)
Risk, risk (Yah)
Ice, ice, ice, bitch (Your voice so clear)
Look at this shit

What kind of rappin' is this? (Tell me) (Your gentle ways)
(So clear, your voice so clear)
Now I'm lookin' at this one
Now I'm lookin' at that one
Now I'm lookin' all over the world, yeah (Your gentle ways)
Lil' bitch I been rapping like this
Niggas thinkin' I strip (Your presence near)
(So clear)

Uh, are you feelin' me now?
Big dog, make 'em follow the script
Like LL when I'm back in the house (Yeah)
Lil' bitch, I been rappin' like this (Uh)
Marion Barry, I'm takin' a hit
He carried a cross, I carry the clip
Like, what kind of rappin' is this?
I pray to him for a sound
Like, please don't deliver me now
Weak man always got so much issue with me
It just happens, it's bound, uh
Lil' bitch, I been rappin' like this
Covered in money, they thinkin' I strip
My pop was a ghost and my partner's ain't shit (No)
I rap like I'm one bar from slittin' my wrist
You one bar away from me splittin' your wig
Say a few words and jump back in the pit

What kind of rappin' is this? (Tell me) (Your gentle ways)
(So clear, your voice so clear)
Now I'm lookin' at this one
Now I'm lookin' at that one
Now I'm lookin' all over the world, yeah (Your gentle ways)
Lil' bitch I been rapping like this
Niggas thinkin' I strip (Your voice so clear)
(Your gentle ways)
