I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
Trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But now it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot nights, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?
I like the motion all night
I was stroking take time out of stroking
Where do you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Girl you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
Missed you missed you so bad
Girl you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you baby, I missed baby

Girl you came into my life
I missed you so bad
