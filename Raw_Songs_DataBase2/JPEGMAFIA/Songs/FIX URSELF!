Oh, rub it, baby, oh, rub it baby
Ooh, rub it, oh, rub it, baby, oh, rub it baby
Oh, rub it, baby, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yes

I'm all alone, I'm at my best
Talkin' that shit, come take my breath
Fake love's what their fantasy says
They always bury the best (Uh)
My success, count up all of my eggs
Stay on God when I move through TECs (Let's go)
Tell me why you hate me (Huh)
You ain't making' no profit
Somebody can't get to the bag (Damn, damn, damn), sad (Shh)
What is you doin', boy?
How is you tryna make it with no talent or cash? (For real)
2020, niggas out here with no clue, no plan and no mask
Damn

I went from nothin' to sluttin', it wasn't easy, babe
Shoutout my bitch and my husband, I love y'all equally
Every mornin' I body shame, I can't stand my face
At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys told make believe
Shoutout my refugees, my fans my family

It's so tragic, baby, who provided for you?
You ain't got nothin' for me, cut that bitch out my story, woah
Who the best? (Pssh) Took a reduction and made a mess (Yeah)
Kid greedy, you a Sudafed
I'll let you bitch niggas do the rest
I love my baby like Trump loves Putin, in the deepest way (Yeah)
My baby's barely scratch the surface, there's a deeper state (Yeah)
Even though you tried to give me top when I was not awake (Huh?)
I know that nigga ain't in the ground but he still dead to me
She's still obsessed with me, it's real

There's no need to fill a void when your past ain't fake
Shoutout my bitch and my husband, y'all get here equally
Momma told me, "Shoot for the stars," so I aim that way
At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys told make believe
Shoutout my refugees, my fans my family

I'm way, I'm-I'm way too real for this shit
You niggas gotta get censors
See, you gotta get censors 'cause they're gonna fuck around and ruin a nigga life
(You know I'm ready) Puss, all of ya
You know I'm ready, y'all make me mad stressed (Yeah, yeah)
I'm really black out here and y'all just performin'
Nobody wants you and you can't absorb it
I can't be scared of me, my bitch is so gorgeous (Ah-ah)

At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade (Yeah)
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way (Yeah)
It's so sad to me (For real), these boys told make believe (Oh yeah)
Shoutout my refugees (Let's go), my fans my family (Pssh), huh

Nasty, real nasty
