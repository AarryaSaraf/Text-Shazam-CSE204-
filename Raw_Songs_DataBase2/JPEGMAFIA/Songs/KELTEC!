Send a person, baby, send her
Send her over, baby, ready
Send her over, come and find me my boo (Same old, same old)
Baby
Oh, I wanna fly, see you 'round (Uh)

I don't need industry praise
Vision distorted, you niggas survivin' off co-signs
Know my credit, keep lockin' the stage
Niggas mad 'cause I'm Black and I'm hostile
Crackers salty, I'm pretty and paid
Bottom bitch wanna jump on the dogpile
Every night I be fannin' the flames
Mentally not a fan of your games
They wanna produce on my aisle
'Cause they know that the market is mean
Niggas will shark your whole style
Hope you're ready to drown for the team
Shaq Fu, you can't stop this reign
I can't believe that my talent brought fame
You can't believe I created a lane
I don't respond to bitch niggas by name, that's trash (Facts)
Scary-ass backpack rappin' niggas never was meant to outlast me
Me and my Kimber like Lana and Lashley, uh
Keep it draped in attachments, uh
Nine on me, I'm sassy
Tatiana when I'm at the crib
With the Smith on me, call it Ashley
Mary Kate, is my Glock in the backseat?
808, watch me peak and attack 'em
All of this talk, my niggas yell, "Action"
How did I catch you lackin'?
When you got no money, I'm laughin'
I'm talkin' minimum wage
Rappers can't do what I do 'cause I own all my shit
And I do all my shit and most y'all can't relate
When Peggy hop in the booth, he get paid
You hit the booth, bitch, you know you a slave
You know what you signed, you know you don't save
You know you a dub, I'm easing the pain
All of my haters are tame
Naysayers, bench players, even all of the coaches between
Peggy Lavar, going back to my roots
Jah bless, now I feel like The Fiend
Mask off in the future foreseen
Mask on, I don't wanna be seen
.PNG, get your quality up
JPEG, I compress all my schemes (Ah)
I put your dome in a beam (Ah)
Kimber tucked in-between
I ain't been shootin' straight since a teen
Hop on the fence and I lean
How is this pussy still runnin' the scene?
What does this actually mean?
Baby, control your demeanor
Niggas don't have to believe (Yeah)
Bet when it happens, like, uh
Bet when it happens, they tweet, ha
(What will that article read?)

It's nasty
(What's up, baby? What's up?)
Say somethin' (Yeah)
All representatives are assisting other veterans
Your call will be answered in the order it was received
