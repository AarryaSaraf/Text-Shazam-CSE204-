Got eighteen minutes
Woah, yeah
Sorry babe, sorry
Yeah, one-two, one-two, one
Sorry babe, woah
Woah, yeah
Sorry babe, sorry
Yeah, sorry babe
Oh, my nigga
In a-in a little tent
Say

I'm covered in money
I'm out for the bag, ooh
I flew out the country (Damn)
Borderline dressin' in drag (Uh)
I brought you a hearse
Hope you fit in the back (Uh)
I'm pokin' it out
Nicki Minaj, the meek gettin' dragged
Bitch, I'm upset, I-
Uh, bitch, I'm upset, I ain't mad

Cutest niggas in my class
Shoutout Zel, Kwes and Thai, those my peers (Shit)
Spittin' slurred, I can't handle my beer
Beat my dick when I look in the mirror (Facts)
When I bust, it cancel my fears
Too much guap (Too much guap)
Too much heat, you can't call for no cops
Too much filmin', you seem like a opp
Fuck the underground, I'm goin' pop
Only Mandy Moore played in this drop
More hits than the four tops
Hairline like a four tops (Stretch)
Rappin' like I signed to Koch
Eatin' ass head to toe in this gold
Can't nobody touch me, I feel like Fort Knox
I'm outta my class, digital dash
Modern-day cannibal, ox

Say
Woo, ooh
Whatever, whatever
Say

I'm covered in money
I'm out for the bag, ooh
I flew out the country (Damn)
Borderline dressin' in drag
I brought you a hearse
Hope you fit in the back (Uh)
I'm pokin' it out
Nicki Minaj, the meek get dragged
Bitch, I'm upset, I- (Bruh)
Uh, bitch, I'm upset, I ain't mad

Say, say
Shit, yeah
Yeah, bitch, I'm upset, I ain't mad (Facts)
Woah, shit
Too much guap-

It's dirty
It's dirty, hah
It's dirty, yeah
Backlog on my personality
'Cause you thinkin' that you know me personally
You rehearse me, and it's surfacing
These ain't bars, I'm describin' a murder scene
This a big ting, money gettin' fucked up like he Ving Rhames
'Cause he don't know my name like the ting, tings
Chuck Berry, big strap, that's my ding-a-ling
Really come from the heart when I sing tings
Finna get this bitch shaking like jingling
R.I.P. Bernie Mac, legend in the game
R.I.P. Bernie Mac
When I die, hope my music gives cowards pain
Pray Allah, Christ, and Buddha, you'll never be shamed
My little kids gonna inherit this fame
E+, my celebrity name, I'ma tell you now
If I go plat' best believe, little bitch that Peggy gon' change
Y'all better pray I stay in my lane
Never switch my ideals for position or fame
If you do dirt, keep it quiet like Pootie Tang
Lose it all for the nut, like Louis C.K
Gag order on him, we ain't tryna be civil
Hoe, I'm aimin' for your head like Martin Luther King
Shoot at your tour bus, we gon' increase your streams
Big strap like Portia de Rossi, I know

Oh, yeah
Damn, niggas just shitted on me
Sorry baby, sorry
Sorry, sorry
Sorry babe, sorry
Sorry babe, sorry
Sorry, sorry
