Said, "Baby, it's all"
And we're way on
Say, "We'll all be feelin', we'll all be feelin', can you feel?"
I'm so sad to be such a negative, a negative refugee
This, uh, uh

At the end of the day, I know your bitch-ass ain't gon' fade
Can't let these niggas talk to me, no fuckin' way
It's so sad to me, these boys so make-believe
Shoutout my refugees, your fans just, uh
