Sin city
Sin city, yeah, I'm in it, man
Rest in peace, rest in peace, Kelly T, all my niggas
Yeah

I lost my license this year
But most these niggas never had one
I'm speeding down the highway looking for grand outcome
My daddy moved back to Jamaica, told me I'm the man son
He said he want a grandson, but he gotta be black
You only fuck these crackers bust it in they throat or they back
Not the inside, grandma passed, I never said bye
Fell out with my sister, I see her, I'll never say hi
Got off the plane in Okinawa, now I'm stateside
Moved to Baltimore 'cause I figured it was a goldmine
Met a girl in Hampden, I figured she was the only
But mama told me these bitches is bitches
Let 'em be lonely, 'fuck em
Car crash putting me in a tough position
Worst credits but more debits, I'm fuckin' wishin'
No TV or WiFi
I'm scrolling down my timeline, thinking about how much a life I'm missing
Bank account looking damn, only get overdraft
New job 
Same shit, different staff
Unlock my phone and go straight to the Instagram
Need to see these crackers living lavish just to get me mad
So I can open notepad and bomb on a nigga
Young black mutant bringing storm to you niggas
2016, I'm still a legend in my own mind
'Cause niggas got expensive tastes but never pay you no mind...
