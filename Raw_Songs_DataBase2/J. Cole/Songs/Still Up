Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Shoutout to Meez 'cause he noticed me, nigga

Got a long ass text message, took the time, yeah, I read it
Sensitivity not my best strength, but I get it
Say she love me, real special, but my heart is real heavy
Try to lighten up the load for the speakers in my Chevy

Big money, damn, still up, yeah
Ten summers, fuck, still up, yeah
Spend it, yeah, still up, yeah
No shit, blah, still up, yeah

I got bitches on my line, I got a million on hold
And I love 'em all the same, gon' be the death of me though
I took two more to the brain and never stepped on the floor
Baby, baby, I'm an angel from my head to my toes

Big money, damn, still up, yeah
Ten summers, fuck, still up, yeah
Spend it, yeah, still up, yeah
No shit, blah, still up, yeah (Wait, wait, like wait-wait)

Top Dawg, yeah, still up, damn
Dreamville, damn (Still up), what's up?
I done worked hard, got bucks up
Loud money, niggas got hushed up
I'm with EARTHGANG and niggas got wavy
Now we got whole game fucked up, yeah
Made it to the top position, work 'til I'll take Top position
'Til every car off the lot we whippin'
I'm in a high position, I ain't used to have a pot to piss in
Nigga, I been so focused
Nigga, move foward, niggas ain't loafin'
I'ma bring change like diggin' in sofas
Squeeze on game like niggas turned cobra

Ain't shit changed, nah, we still us, uh
She ain't cute, hah, but we drunk, yeah
Fat ass, shit, still fucked, still fucked

I got bitches on my line, I got a million on hold
And I love 'em all the same, gon' be the death of me though
I took two more to the brain and never stepped on the floor
Baby, baby, I'm an angel from my head to my toes

Big money, damn, still up, yeah
Ten summers, fuck, still up, yeah
Spend it, yeah, still up, yeah
No shit, blah (No shit), still up, yeah (Still up)

The 0-1-2, I was in a Pontiac with my dude
Braggin' 'bout a ho we bagged, that we screwed
Sippin' on the cognac with the juice
Swerved, jumped the curb, lived to talk about it, nigga
Roll a blunt, nigga, lucky you
Jesus saved the world, money make the rules
Nigga livin' dirty, feel like Bonnaroo
Feel like I was told, feel like I could choose
Feel like gettin' blown when I got the blues
Used to walk home, Reebok soldier
Quick hop the fence, holes in my shoes
Holes in your story, I smell a rat
You don't see money 'til we see the proof
Bitch, I'm rare, it's a million yous
For the internet shit, what you really gon' do?
I've been in my bag and my carry-on too
My day-ones barbarians too
I walk through, glow like aquarium do
Marry my job, paradise go wherever I move
Feelin' like 'Pac, but I'm livin' like Snoop
Die in denial, then live in your truth
Givin' no fucks, still spillin' like, "Oops"

I got bitches on my line, I got a million on hold
And I love 'em all the same, gon' be the death of me though
I took two more to the brain and never stepped on the floor
Baby, baby, I'm an angel from my head to my toes

Big money, damn, still up, yeah
Ten summers, fuck, still up, yeah
Spend it, yeah, still up, yeah
No shit, blah, still up, yeah
