Started out a hustler
Now I keep it simple, barely move a muscle (Uh)
I was with the chicken
It was hella temptin', like I'm David Ruffin (Uh)
I come from the struggle (Yeah)
Don't mean I'ma struggle (Look)
Took my dreads and cut 'em
Used to do the butters, now I just do better

Uh, need you, yeah, they need you
Flow on Mercury
Ayy, I don't mean seafood
It's in my gene, my DNA, then my Evisu
I get the fee, send me the pay
That's just the things to you

Brag about my blessings very often
Like a jellyfish, I cannot get it off me
Tell my grandmother that you can get the car keys
Know my niggas got me, if they ever try me
G-Star with the high cuff, yeah
She say my dick is to die for, yeah
We are not doin' no cyphers, no
We in the booth with the white chalk

Ayy, need you, yeah, they need you
Ayy, need you
Ayy, ooh, yeah
Need you, yeah, they need you


I'm high off altitude, I had to do this shit to free me
Was shackled by the lack of action, I'm a loaded gun
Apply my aptitude to raps and now my family see me on the TV
Got me feelin' like I'm momma's favorite son
Lampin' with this foreign chick, she look like Nefertiti
She spoke about her summer travels and how far she come
She climbed up Machu Picchu, lookin' for herself
But really found that does not limit what you could become
None (Oh)
Leave the past where it really happened
Half the time you was really cappin'
Other half you was learnin' somethin'
That in ya' eyes I could see the passion
Greener pastures, to see ya' blessings is hard enough
I see ya' glasses all foggin' up


Ayy, need you, yeah, they need you
Ayy, need you
Ayy, ooh, yeah
Need you, yeah, they need you
(Turn me up, turn me up)


I got a thing for checks (Oh-oh)
Check off a list of things I got, shit
I got a thing for sex (Oh-oh)
I got a thing for seein' the text before I read it back, dyslexic (Oh-oh)
I got a thing later on, I'ma probably can't even hit you back, shit
I got a thing for you and I guess you can't really get into that ish
Complicated like a carrot and Nana, got that thang in my whip
I got that bitch so bad you'll cry for me if she ever did dip
Ooh, Ceviche, fuck what he say
Me, her, her we do that threeway, okay, okay
Free bass, we charge for treble
Heat up and tip the kettle
She want the tea on me
Her lip done touched my bezel
Fuck 'round and juke the devil

Spin move
Spin move
Spin move


Midnight in the dark, I'm with your body
Is it cool if I end it?
Let me know if it's alright
Always cooler in midnight
In the dark I'm with your body
Is it cool if I end it?
Let me know if it's alright
Oh, you're a blessing
How could you forget this?
In every way you tell me, I'm okay
When you know I'm not
You know I'm not
You know I'm not
You know I'm not, yeah
