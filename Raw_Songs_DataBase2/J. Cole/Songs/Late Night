Lil', lil' sauce, lil' drop
Yeah, yeah
Yo, yeah, look

Lately, I've been feeling like whatever (Whatever)
I think that's been spreading to my niggas (My niggas)
'Cause all that nigga ever do is smoke weed
And all he ever do is kill his liver (His liver)
I told my nigga to stop mixing that liquor
I told him it's only gonna make him sicker to kill you
Now hurry and pass me that fifth of tequila
'Cause I'ma kill it, come on, dawg, let me get it
Cozz is an idiot, I shouldn't hit raw, but I'm hittin' it (I'm hittin' it)
Lately, I've been using prayers for condoms
But I'm clean but my God is so awesome
Fuck you mean I ain't toppin' your roster?
Listerine, when I'm talking it's toxic, this hot shit
So when you start talking, don't get out of pocket
Like a bean or dolphin, we poppin', that's obvious


I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close
I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close


Politics, gotta get dollars quick, I can't stall
Momma need a crib with a big backyard
I ain't got time for your text, can't talk, gotta make art
Dog I'm a silent, cocky, heart like Rocky
Ball from the Chi, not a carbon copy of Common
But respect dog, he's a G.O.A.T.
Got my own drip, dope bar on a coat
Follow my thesis
I just been tryna live decent
Dodging the precinct
Mindin' my P's & Q's
Dreamville season, we been due
People was bleedin', needed some truth
Who left they sleep, it made me a beast
Now it's a feast, the trees have bloomed
My niggas need M's, I need some too, yeah


I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close
I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close


Yeah, I need to get my shit together
Lately, I've been out here fuckin' on whatever
When you hit the pussy raw, it feel better
Acting reckless, I think I should get a check-up
Check-up, check-up
Niggas say I'm next up, fuck that, fuck that
Nigga, I'm the best out
I can't have these niggas treat me like a stepchild
Never graduated college but I'm set now
Thank God
This a living heaven
I think I'ma need a halo and some feathers
Dancin' with the devil, I should get a scepter
Mom and daddy always giving nigga lectures
Question, question, baby, what's your preference?
I can hit it from the side or you could ride it a little
Girl, I got a backstroke that's cold as the winter
I might make you breakfast but I'm never gonna take your ass to dinner


I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close
