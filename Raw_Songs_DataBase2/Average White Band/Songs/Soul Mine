Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine

You make me work, just love to see me sweat
The hotter baby, the rougher that it gets
You're a heart's stopper, you must be made of stone
Sometimes I swear I wish, you'd leave me alone

It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
Working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Can I have some fun, yeah

You make it seem, you're having fun when I hurt
I'm like a dog, just digging in the dirt
Sometimes I think you don't know what you're doing to me
Back on my knees, got a mind to set me free

It's like working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
When can I have some fun

Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine

Believe me baby, I don't wanna be this way
You bring me trouble girl, what more can I say
Give me soul, blood and roll, my fingers to the bone
Give me back my soul babe, I wanna take my spirit home

I'm working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
I gotta have some fun

It's like working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
I gotta have some fun
