We didn't come around here to sit around and mope, no no
We didn't come around here to sit like this and lookin' bored
We came down here to party
That's what we're gonna do
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away

I know that times are tough
But it ain't here, not tonight, no no
Get up off your backside
Got to d it right
Let's roll up the carpet
Time to get down
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away

Now that we got started
Let's keep keepin' on till dawn
I won't stop until I drop
Got to get it on
We came down here to party
That's what we're goin' do
Groovin' the night away
Groovin' the night away
