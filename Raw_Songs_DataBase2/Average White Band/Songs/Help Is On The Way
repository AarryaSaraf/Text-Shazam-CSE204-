Seems to me you've been hide far too long
Watchin' the sands of time trickle away
Won't you talk to me
Tell me what's eatin' at 'cha
Even if you don't know what to say

You know that the time is right
To turn this thing around
It's getting closer to you
Don't give up because pain is all you've found

Lighten up 'cause help is on the way
Have a little faith in someone new
This is not a line I'm throwin'
Lighten up 'cause help is on the way

You and me, walking down easy streets together
Is a dream I cannot see slippin' away
Why don't you get to me
Over this distance you've created
And I'll put you in, set you free

You know the time is right
To turn this thing around
You're getting closer to me
Don't give up because pain is all you've found

Lighten up 'cause help is on the way
Have a little faith in someone new
This is not a line I'm throwin'
Lighten up 'cause help is on the way
