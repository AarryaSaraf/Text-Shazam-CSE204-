I used to wake up at night
With this song going through my mind
Tried so hard to write is all down
But the melody was hard to find
Then one night about a week ago
I was passing a nightclub door
I heard something
That made me turn around
I had to go inside for more

It was the same feeling
A different song
Thought I'd heard it before
But it must be wrong
Same beat, just a different groove
Whatever it I
Makes you want to move, move, move

Those people were dancing a new thing
Going crazy before my eyes
I felt the shivers come over me
Knew I had to take a run outside
I went back home and turned my radio on
The D.J. had just begun

He said this song is a mystery to me
But I know it has to be a number one

It had the same feeling
A different song
Thought I'd heard it before
But it must be wrong
Same beat, but a different groove
Whatever it is
Makes you want to move, move, move

I thought it was the same old thing
But as I listened
Something changed
Now everywhere I go it keeps on
Haunting me
It was that same feeling
To find out what the secret is
Is easy said but hard to do
I leave it up to you to solve the mystery
It was the same feeling
