Woman I can understand you
Although I love you to my soul
You got me so confused
That I don't know which way to turn

What can I do?
(I wish I knew)
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay (yeah, yeah)

Say you love me deeply
But you still got somebody else
Seems like distance
Circumstance is keeping us apart

I just don't know
And I'm wondering
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay

Little, little bit
You's a little bit too much
Makes you stop and think
As the best really, really come and go
Ooh

If only this (if only this)
If only that (only that)
If only thinking
I could hold you one more time

Would you stay?
Would you stay?

Ooh
If you came back
Would you stay? (Would you stay?)
Would you stay? (Would you stay?)
Stay

Ooh
This uncertainty is killing me baby
I gotta know
Would you stay? Yeah
And hold me

You gotta let me know
Would you really
Would you stay, stay, stay
I wanna know, I gotta know baby
If you came back baby
Would you stay?
Stay
