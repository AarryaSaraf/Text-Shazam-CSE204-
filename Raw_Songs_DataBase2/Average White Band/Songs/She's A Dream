Yes, she was beautiful
And she smiled at me
As she passed my way
In the heat of the noon day sun
Oh the promise of those eyes
Got me hypnotized
I ask her to stay
And continue what she's begun
She stayed and I wondered why
As the time flew by
Day faded away into the night
It all felt so perfect
When it dawned on me
I saw the light

She was a dream
Disappearing as quick
As she came into view
When I awoke to find
She was a dream

Tried to get myself back to sleep
To chase her shadow along the night
Keep this illusion alive
I felt that we'd met before
On another shore some other time
She was a love of mine

Oh she was a dream
Thought that my ship had come in
Then I awoke to find
She was a dream

Every night I lay me down to sleep
I pray that I'll find her again
Though I know in my heart
She's a dream
She's a dream

When I think of that island day
The ocean spray the burning sand
It all seems so real
And if we ever meet again
Somewhere out there
I know just how I feel

She was a dream
Every night I lay me down to sleep
I pray that I'll find her again
Thought I know in my heart
She's a dream
She's a dream
Oh, I know
She's a dream...

Just my imagination running away with me
Ooh I don't even know her name
Ooh gonna find her, gotta find her
She's a dream
She's a dream
