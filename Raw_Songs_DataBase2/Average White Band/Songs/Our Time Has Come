Looking back on the road we left behind
I wonder just what it is we've done
Seems like we've earned the right
To throw the dice again
Let's make the pieces fit together as one

To be masters of our own fate
Is all we're asking for
Looks like we don't have long
To wait, no more

Now, now that our time has come
Let's take our chance right now
Now, let's finish what we begun
No time to hang around
Now that our time has finally come around

Looking ahead, just one step at a time
I think that by now we should know enough
Seems like we've learned the way
To keep it all in line
There ain't no way that we will let it get too tough

To be running in our own race
Is all we're asking for
Looks like we don't have long
To wait, no more

Now, now that our time has come
Let's take our chance right now
Finish what we begun
No time to hang around
Now that our time has finally come around
