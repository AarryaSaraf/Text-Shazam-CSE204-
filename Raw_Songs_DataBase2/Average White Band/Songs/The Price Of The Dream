The price of the dream is dear
Let me make it clear
Let me make it clear to you right now

Look at me, do you think I would try
Breaking your heart
There is no reason to tear yourself apart
No, no
The price of the dream is dear, let me make
It clear
Let me say that I would do all that I can
For you

You know what we got to do
I can see through your eyes too
It takes some understanding

To see it through without demanding
A little bit of give and take is what it needs
You and me that's the way I always want
It to stay

Please tell me baby
Do you think we can make this sacrifice
The bumpy road to love, is worth all that
It costs
The price of the dream is clear
It's already here right now, right now
Right here and now
The price of the dream is dear
Let me make it clear, right now
The price of the dream is clear
