Oh my

I got to leave but something within won't let me turn around
Don't look at me, those eyes just pull me in and now I'm going down
It's getting late, the hands upon the wall begin to beckon me
Don't make me hesitate, you know there's somewhere else I really ought to be

But no matter how much I try to resist
You're making it hard to deny

That I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
I got to stay

Because I'm in too deep

Don't let me go, you're killing me with love and now I'm losing ground
I can't say no if this is how I'm gonna die then let me drown

And no matter how much I try to resist
You're making it hard to deny

That I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away, oh no
I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
I got to stay

You know I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
You know I got to stay baby

I'm way in over my head, believe me
I may be out of my mind
Its weight has hold of my say, but leaving
The ship won't sail out this time
'Cause I'm in too deep

What happens now, we've been loving, been talking half the night
No, there's no doubt, we've got to face it, there's gonna be a fight

Beause we're in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, we're in too deep
My heart tells me
Oh, I really wanna stay with you baby

In too deep
In too deep
I'm in too deep
I'm losing sleep
That secret side can't keep on
In too deep
My heart tells me
