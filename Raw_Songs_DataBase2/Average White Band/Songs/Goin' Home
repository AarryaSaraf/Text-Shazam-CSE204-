Goin' home, goin' home

Goin' home, goin' home
Take a little bit of funk, little bit of soul
And tell them that, I'm back gettin' ready to roll
Take a little horns, let them blow
Just put it on the game, goin' home

Ah, the guitar's calling

Ah yeah, goin' home
Ah yeah, goin' home
Ah yeah, goin' home
Goin' home
Goin' home
Goin' home
Ow!

Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?

Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Because we're goin' home
Are you ready?
