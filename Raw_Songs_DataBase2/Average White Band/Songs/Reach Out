Reach on out and touch me
Give me thrills like I never had
Reach on out and touch me
You got something that is driving me mad

My head is reeling
Nobody ever had me feeling this way

Reach on out and touch me
Well I'm having a bad time waiting for your love
Reach on out and touch me
Keep it moving till I tell ya I've had enough

So come on keep it rising
The feeling is surprising to know (oh.. yeah)

You can take it all
Take it any way you like (oh.. yeah)

I said you can take it all
When you give it back sure gonna do it right (yeah yeah)

(That's what I'm talking about...)

Reach on out and touch me baby
This is what I wanted to know (yeah)
Reach out over here and thrill me with your love
Cause I ain't never had it this way before

Now you can feel it coming on
Just shake it one more time and I'll be gone

Reach out touch me
You better reach out (out, oh baby touch me)
