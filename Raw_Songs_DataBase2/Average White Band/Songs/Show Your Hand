I've been watchin' how you look at me
Tryna figure out what have I got to do to call
But you won't give me a clue
Now, people say I'm a gambling man
That I don't give away more than I can
But the stake's gettin' heavy
And I don't know if you're ready
For all the things I have in mind
I'll have to wait my time
Until you show your hand

Well, I've been advised not to mess around
Everybody said that you are a hard nut to crack
You say you don't give your love away
'Cause you might not get it back
But, this time I feel that I'm gettin' in deep
But in my heart, where my money used to be

Now the stakes are much higher
My soul is on fire
There's nothin' I can do
But seein' through

Show your hand
Would ya, show your hand?
Let me be a lovin' man, yeah
Show your hand
Well, just show your hand to me
Now, now, don't be afraid to lose, yeah
So even if it breaks me
You know you can take me
There is nothin' I can do

I've been advised not to mess around
Everybody said that you are a hard nut to crack
You say you don't give your love away
'Cause you might not get it back
This time I feel that I'm gettin' in deep
But in my heart, where my money used to be

Now the stakes are much higher
My soul is on fire
There's nothin' I can do
But seein' through

Show your hand
Would ya, show your hand
Let me be a lovin' man, yeah
Show your hand
Well, just show your hand to me
Now, now, don't be afraid to lose
So, come on, show your hand
Baby, I can make you understand
Show your hand
Show your hand
Even if it breaks me
You know you can take me
There is nothin' I can do
Still in love with you
