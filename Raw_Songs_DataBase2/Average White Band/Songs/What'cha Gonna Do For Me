All night and all day, just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone
The ground that you lose exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
Still, as deep as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

Whatcha gonna do for me
What are you gonna do for me
Whatcha gonna do for me, when
The chips are down

In the cool of the night, when nothing seems right

The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true
If you try to conceal the way
That you feel
You're askin' for trouble
Just as sure as you'll cry
I'm keepin' my eye on you

You don't have to tell me I'm to blame for this
The thing you hold against me is the thing that I miss
