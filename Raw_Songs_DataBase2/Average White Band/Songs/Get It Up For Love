It's a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you saw the riddle you can save your soul
Chase love's shadow 'til the river's running cold

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

There's a longing in the people
No one knows just when the heartaches will cease
You can free and tell her, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream, "Hey, it's just my right"

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

So, a smile, another fallin' star (ooh)
Tell us by the right side (ah, ah, ah, ah)
So long until we find
Just put your hand in mine, oh yeah

It's a tricky situation
Heaven knows just where the struggle must end
If it takes forever, I'd got the time above
I won't desert you when the tables have turned

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh)

Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
All the way for love, get it up all the way

Aw, get it up (get it up for love) all the way
Get it up for love (get it up)
All the way (get it up for love) all the way
Get it up (get it up)

Oh baby, get it up (get it up for love)
(Get it up)
Get it up for love, get it up
(Get it up for love) get it up
(Get it up)

Get it up for love
Get it up for love
Get it up for love (get it up for love)
(Get it up)

(Get it up for love)
(Get it up)
