Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh
Now here something new

You can play the game
You can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't written for you
Tell me how can you stand there
With your broken heart
Ashamed of playin' a fool?

When one thing can lead to another
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Father and mother
Sister and brother
If it feels right
Don't think twice

Just shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel (show them the way that you feel)
Things are gonna work out fine (things are gonna work out fine)
(If you only will) if you only will

What I wanna say to you is
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way you feel, oh
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will, hmm
Only will

You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do
With your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone

Once you tell somebody
The way that you feel
You can feel it begin to ease

Its true what they say
About the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease
And it's better to

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel (show them the way you feel)
Things are gonna be just fine
If you only will
What I wanna say to you is

Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way (show them the way you feel)
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will
Only will, only will hmm oh-ooh-oh

In every life a little bit of rain must fall
No one can have it all, no

So let me tell you
Shower the people (in every life yeah)
Show them the way (some rain must fall, yes it will)
Shower the people (just like a pouring rain)
Show them the way you feel (make it rain)
Shower the people you (make it rain with love, love, love)
Show them the way (said shower yeah)

Shower the people (oh make it rain, oh Lord)
Show them the way that you feel (make it rain)
Shower the people you love (you gotta love somebody)
Show them the way you feel (don't be afraid to show them how you feel)
Shower the people (with the real love in our heart now)
Show them the way (way)
Show them the way
