I wrote a song to sing you
But I couldn't find the right words
When I tried to call you
There was no reply
So I had to keep on hoping
We might meet again somewhere (where)

In this world as you drift into my sweet mind
I wonder as the daylight fades
And the nights grow colder without you
Will I find your kind of love again
Until then

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think...

You have a way about you
That is difficult to replace
Reaching out to find you
If you hear this song
You will understand what I'm saying
Could it be just like it was before
Once again

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you

Could it be just like it was before?
Once again baby

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Every little thing you do

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Ooh every little thing you do girl yeah

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think of you
Ooh my baby

Funny thing love can bring
Sunny days make me think...

Makes me think of you...
