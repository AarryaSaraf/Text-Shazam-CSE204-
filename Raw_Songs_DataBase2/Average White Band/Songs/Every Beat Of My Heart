Each day goes by, doing all the simple things I must
It takes most all that I have, waiting only for the nights
We'll be together, darling
We know what little time, we have baby
Let's make each minute seem, like it could be our last one alive

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

As daylight comes, the morning steals the shadows from your face
Soon I'll be far on my way, taking along this memory
With me wherever I go, darling
Whatever little time we share, baby
There's not a minute, I don't realize just how much I care

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

Closer to you darling, with every beat of my heart
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart
