Back in '67 I could see my way to heaven with a rock 'n' roll band
Time was right for choosin' and working seemed like losin', some folks don't understand
Well, it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another 22 down below
But there's only one way to go, so we're movin' on

Now we have lunatics and crazies and 15 move and shakers, but jokes are clean
And from Egypt to Stonehaven the scenes have been amazing, well you know what I mean
But it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another thousand miles still to go
The company is getting slow, yes it is

As long as it's freezing that song keeps just squeezing me on, squeezing me on
But we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
Hm, you show me

Oh, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on

Well now, you name the places, we can show our faces anywhere that you want
And if the room has got a floor then there's room for thousands more, the field is there if you want
God, it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another 22 down below
But there's only one way to go, listen now

As long as its freezing that song keeps just squeezing me on, it's just squeezing me on
Well, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
Ah, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on, yes we have
Yeah, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
