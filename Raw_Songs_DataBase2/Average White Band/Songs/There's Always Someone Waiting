There's always someone waiting
Looking over your shoulder
When you go to pick up the prize
That you've been working for
But don't tell me you've been taken
Everyday you get older
If you take a look inside
You don't have to look no more

There's always someone waiting
Trying to pick up your woman
And the time you think it's safe
Then she's been spoken for
Better watch out where it's going
Just in case it don't come back
And the money that you spend
Turns into days and nights
So I wonder, yes, I wonder who
Yes I wonder, well I really do
Who is waiting, who is waiting for me

There's always someone waiting
Looking over your shoulder
When you think you got it made
And everything is lemonade
But you never seem to get there
Someone's taken the cream
And you don't realize that
You're still stuck in between
There's always something creeping
Taking over you body
When you think you got control
It's getting closer to you
But you know that there's a reason
For the time that it takes
Trying to cut you down to size
Just when you start to fake

Yes I wonder, I wonder who
Yes I wonder, yes I really do
Might it be your next door neighbor
Maybe your agent or even your friend
I said be careful, tread wary
Be careful on who you depend

Well I just wonder, who is waiting for me
