You never made it your business, no
You never said that you'd take me there
You never told me you loved me
Yet I know that you care, oh yeah

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Makes you wonder why (why)
It's a heartache (heartache) oh, oh
Give it one more try (try)

The sudden death in the jungle
A true believer in paradise (oooh-oh)
You never answer your feelings, no
But I see it in your eyes, oooh

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Once you come alive
It's a heartache (heartache)
That you love so much (love so much)

All we lack (all that we lack)
It's a bridge of words
Call me back (call me back)
There's too much at stake

I can't bear to love alone
Oooh

Ohhh ohhh

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Once you come alive
It's a heartache (heartache), ohh
That you love so much (love so much)

Shine on me, don't wait
I don't seem to know myself of late
I know part of me is you
I can't seam or separate the two

Love's a heartache (heartache), oh, oooh
Once you come alive
It's a heartache
