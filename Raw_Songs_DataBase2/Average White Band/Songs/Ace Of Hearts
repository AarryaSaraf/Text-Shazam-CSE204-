Just to be with you now
Is one thing I can't imagine
'Cause the part you play today
Is the one that was missing
And from where I stand right now
I can see, so clearly
That with every passing day
I want more of this magic

You're the ace of hearts
Number one in everything
That comes to mind
I think about it all the time
How you won my heart, easy
Easy was the game you played
Easy 'cause you had it made

So you see what you have done

And there's no way to undo it
I have only just begun
To understand it
Now on thing is clear to me
There is love and there is real love
And the only way to know
Is feel what I'm feeling

You're the ace of hearts
Number one in everything
That comes to mind
I think about it all the time
How you won my heart, easy
Easy was the game you played
Easy 'cause you had it made
