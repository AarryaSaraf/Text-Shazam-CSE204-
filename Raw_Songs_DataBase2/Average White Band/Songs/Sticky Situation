I told my girl
I had some business to attend to
I won't be stopping by tonight
I got sidetrack
Some place I've never been to
Taken in by the music and the lights
I saw this lady
Giving me the eye
I mean, for too long
She had me on the floor
Moving to the rhytm
Deep into the groove
When I saw my baby walking through the door

Now everytime I push my luck
Seems to snap right back at me
Now everyone could see
It was a sticky situation
It was, look at him girl
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

I look at her
She look at me
From the look we give each other
That was history

Out of nowhere
Two drinks in my face
And then on and on
They walk out of that place

And when they stop me with the bill
At an answer to injury
I didn't have enough to pay

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love mine
Oh, no good
I'll tell you what it was

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

It was a sticky situation
Couldn't look at the crowd
Got me with my face down
It was a sticky situation
Why do this things happen to me?
I don't know baby

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face (in my face)

Sticky situation
