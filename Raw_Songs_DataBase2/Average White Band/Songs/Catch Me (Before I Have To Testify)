I stand accused, I have designs on you
I can't reveal what I've a mind to do
I am no angel, can't you see
No wings have I

So what would you want your man to be
Tell me, tell me
A saint or a sinner, a little of each

Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away

I didn't want to give the game away
Would you?
Ain't that ever true
The mystery's there to keep us hooked
No need to do it by the book

So where would you want my strength to be
Tell me, tell me
A friend or a lover, a just little of each

Catch me away...

Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away
Catch me before I have to testify
Don't make me give it all away

I did not want to give my game away to you
Don't make me give it all away
Catch me before I'm called upon to testify
Don't make me give it all away
...
