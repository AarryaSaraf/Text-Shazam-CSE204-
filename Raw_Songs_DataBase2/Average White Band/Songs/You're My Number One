When it gets up the sunshine, is that what I'm about to go
So if I tried to get my love to someone else
I know it's love I'd be without
And love like us won't come around every day
And I need you all the way

Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love
Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love

I admit that I am in love yeah
Confused that I have place to go
No need to tell you I've been cheated in my mind
It's written on our face yeah

But now I know our love is real
Understand it
I don't want nobody else

Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love
Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Ooh, ooh

You're my number one (you understand)
Number one (ooh, ooh)
I don't want nobody else
You're my number one (you understand)
Number one
You better believe it, yeah
I don't want anybody else

You're my number one
You're my number one and only love (my love)
Oh
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Oh (oh)
You're my number one (you're my number one)
You're my number one and only love (number one and only love)
You better believe it
Oh (ooh)
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Oh
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love
