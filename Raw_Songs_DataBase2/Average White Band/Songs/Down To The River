Take me down, baby, oh

I've been searching high, I went so low
Anywhere love could be that's where I go
If you give me the answer, I wouldn't know

I've been out in the cold, please take me in
There's a whole lot of love I have to give
And I want you to save me from my sins

Now I'm ready to turn the page, baby (Turn the page)
You can show me a better way

Why don't you take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power over me

They say the water is deep, but I don't care
I can swim against tides, go anywhere
Just as long as it's you that takes me there
Tell me 'bout it

Now I'm ready to justify, baby (Justify)
You can show me a reason why

Why don't you take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power over me

So come on, take me down to the river, baby
Let me go to the other side
We can do this together, if you
Let me take that heavenly ride

Let me take a ride, baby
Won't you, won't you, won't you, come, come, come, come, get me now

Now I have you here at last
I was hoping you would find me
Whatever happened in the past
There's no need to remind me

It's time to take me down to the river, baby
Bathe my soul in the midnight hour
I've been waiting forever, baby
You got the power that I need

So come on, take me down to the river, baby
Let me go to the other side (The other side)
We can do this together, if you
Let me take that heavenly ride
Let me take that heavenly ride

Won't you let me, let me take that heavenly ride
Let me take that heavenly ride

Take me down to the river, baby
Take me tonight
Take me down to the river, baby
Take me to the other side (Take me to the other side)

Take me down to the river, baby
Take me tonight
Take me down to the river, baby
Wash my soul and let it dry (Let it dry)
