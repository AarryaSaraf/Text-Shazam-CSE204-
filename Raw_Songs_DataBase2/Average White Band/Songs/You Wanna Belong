You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to
You wanna belong
There's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do

Sometimes you see me coming
And you go the other way
Running from a love you know that you need
But I'll keep right on coming, day after day
To capture your attention and finally make you see

You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to
You wanna belong
There's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
You wanna belong

Know that I
Have slaved through times and hills
When you touched the bound
But you passed me by
But I'm the one who cares enough to stay around, oh
You're always hesitating like you can't make up your mind
But you're the one who's waiting
And surely you would find

You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to (oh-oh)
You wanna belong
And there's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
Come on and belong

Sometimes you see me coming
And you go the other way
But I keep right on coming
Day after day (day after day) oh

You wanna belong
Belong to someone who will love you
Like you want them to (oh-oh)
You wanna belong
And there's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
You wanna belong, oh-ooh

You wanna belong (come on and belong oh-oh)
You wanna belong (come on and belong)
Hay-ayy-ay
You wanna belong
