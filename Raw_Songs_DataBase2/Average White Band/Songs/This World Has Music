When no, ain't no melody
One line to phrase
Everybody (everybody) got to have a song to sing
One beat and no rhythm
One mixtape beat no groove
Everybody (everybody) get on and make a move
(Make a move)

That this World has music
This World has music
This World has music, but you got to listen (oh-oh)
Na na listen (you better listen)
Na na listen
