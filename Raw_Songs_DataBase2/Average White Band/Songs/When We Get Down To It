Funny how, I was there at the beginning
But you never heard my cry
Reaching out to the ones, who were not giving
They were never on your side

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it babe
You're gonna want the world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing else but love will do
When we get round to it babe
I wanna be down, get down with you girl

Ooh deep down with you
When we get round to it

Can't you see all the chances we've been missing
All the nights that passed us by, baby
Now we're alone, your lips are mine for kissing
No time to wrestle with your pride

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it babe
You're gonna want the world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing else but love will do
When we get proud to it babe
I want to get down, get down with you girl

Oh baby
Oh, it's no ordinary thing that we share
What you give to me, girl
Oh, there's no reason, we should try to hide it
Take love when you find it, oh

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it, babe
I want the whole wide world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing but love will do
When we get round to it, baby
I want to be down with you
When we get down to it
