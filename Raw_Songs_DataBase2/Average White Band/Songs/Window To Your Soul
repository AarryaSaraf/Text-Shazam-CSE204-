Did you ever stop to wonder
What it's like to be on the other side
Looking in on all the things you try to hide
You don't wanna know
Whatever else you take for granted
Don't ever sell yourself short
That ain't fair
I can turn around the mirror in your heart
You'll come to know the one who really cares

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
There's so much more you have to offer me
It's like a stream that's running deep under the ground
If digging deeper helps me bring it to the light
You'll be glad I was around

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Don't try to fight it baby, don't say no

Don't say no, baby
No use denying I hold the key
Just let go, baby
No use in crying when you can lean on me...

They say love can last forever
That means we take the bad, not only the good
Even if sometimes you have a frightened heart
At least you know you'll be understood

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Don't try to fight it baby, don't say no
