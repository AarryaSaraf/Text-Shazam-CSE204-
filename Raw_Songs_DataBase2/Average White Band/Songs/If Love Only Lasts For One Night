Here we are
You and I together for the first time
Though heaven knows, I've wanted you
And I guess you knew but we just never said
Or never had the chance

And if love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

Holding you
Seems like this is what the night was made for
Though who can say what lies ahead
Will this flame that flickers in the darkness
Survive the light of day

And if love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

If love only lasts for one night
That would still be all right

If love only lasts for one night
We've got the morning to remember and decide
That if love only lasts for one night
We will have tested something
We always wanted to try

And if love only lasts for one night
We got the morning, oh yeah
If love only lasts for tonight
If love only lasts for on night
We will remember, oh yeah
If love only lasts for tonight
