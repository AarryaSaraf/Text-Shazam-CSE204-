I always thought I'd have the answers
Nothing would get in my way
I always thought we would last forever
Till my love changed
And all the things that were promised
I know I let you slip away
This is the hardest thing I have to say

Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye

Looking for a way to justify it
But coming up short of things to say
I always thought we would stay together
Till my love changed
Maybe if I did you different
Maybe you'd still be in my life
But we both know that I didn't do you right, no

Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
And even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Ooh baby...
Ooh... even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye
Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye
