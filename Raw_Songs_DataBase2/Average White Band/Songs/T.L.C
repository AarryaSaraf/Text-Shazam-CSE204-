When we make music, we gotta make that with a swing
If we all keep it up, we can all get it out somewhere
When we make love it ain't no different, no
All a woman needs is a tender love and care

T L C it's short for tender love and care
It's all you gotta know (tender love and care)
But if you don't believe, it's not gonna get you anywhere
Keep pushing, still got a long way to go

T L C
And when you're working hard and there ain't much left to give
You know your love ain't going anywhere
That woman won't care about how much it takes to live
If you just get down and give her some of that thing that you got there

T L C
Tender love and care
That's all it needs
T L C
Tender love and care
Certain affection guaranteed

And when you feel that groove you better not miss what's going on
She's giving you the chance you gotta keep giving it all you can
No stop to think about it 'cause if you leave that girl without it
She's gonna find her TLC from some other man so keep on giving her

T L C
Tender love and care
It's all you need to make it
And you know she can thank it
T L C
Tender love and care
Whatever you do, you gotta do it right

'Cause you don't leave a woman lonely at night

Here it comes now
Whatever you do, you gotta do it right, yeah
T L C
As if only the woman lonely night
Gotta give her the action
T L C
You wanna get some savage back
Be the love you got
T L C
Do what you can, know where the flame is a heart
T L C
Whatever it is much to give
But whatever it is it's the way to live
