I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

Baby, what I've seen, I like a lot
Nothin' gonna change my mind
You're the one
Now I wanna find what else you got
Come on 'cause I know
You're the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

No pushin', no shovin'
Gonna get me a loving that easy
The slower I go there's a chance that you might get away
Gotta say

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I've been watching you from day to day
Thinkin' to myself, "She's the one"
Girl, need nobody else, you say to me
Amen, you got hunch
She's the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I've seen it from a distance
That there's no existence to my eyes
(No, no, no)
Your smile kinda tells me
That I might just be the one for you

I'm the one
I'm the one

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you
I'm the one
I'm the one who wants you

I...
I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you

I'm the one
I'm the one
I'm the one
That wants you
