Album: ShowYourHand

// Jugglers //

It might be my imagination
But I can feel the spirit moving up on me
I get the creepin', when I should be sleeping
And the music isn't like it use to be
What am I gonna to do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
I had a word with the Joker my friend
Here's a game that you might like to play
We call it running business and then, blow the opposition all away
You do it
What am I gonna do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
How am I to get by, well I can't even try

How am I to get through, don't know what I'm gonna do
You might be afraid when the Jugglers in town
That's because they try to see my face
But they got a shock, on what I'm putting down
There'll be Jugglers lying all over the place
What am I gonna do about it sister
How am I to take the strain
What am I gonna do about it sister, yeah
The needle brings it all back again
What am I gonna do
I'm asking you, what am I gonna do
Play on it
Play on it
Play on it...
Don't let it get you down, down
Don't let it get you down, down

// Twilight Zone //

Don't it feel bad
When your woman is mad that you don't come home
And you try to pretend that it doesn't affect you
Still you wait by the phone

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Nothing that you can do
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

Something is wrong, she's been gone so long
I wonder where can she be
And you stop to imagine
About the bone left stucken
And if it still become much stronger than me

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Love is just standing still
Caught in a twilight zone
But you never quit

How I wish that I could hear her key in the door
Yeah that would please me
Jump at every sound, every scrape at the floor
Just try to tease me

Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
Somethings have just got to change
Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
These things got to be talked about
Plans to re-arrange

Bad as it seems
This must be something I can raise above
Because it comes to each and everyone
Rich or poor, every mother son
Whoever fell in love

And you're caught in a twilight zone
Nothing that you can do
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

How I wish that I could hear her key in the door
Yeah that would please me, hmm
Jump at every sound, every scrape at the floor
Just try to tease me

But I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
Somethings have just got to change
Well I wanna let you
I'm gonna let you know
These things got to be talked about
Plans to re-arrange

And you're caught in a twilight zone
That is just bad at scale
Caught in a twilight zone
It's great it happen

Hey (I know) oh yeah, yeah

// Put It Where You Want It //

Put it where you want it
That won't take much time
We can make the best of it and I could make you mine
Put it where you want it
Bring your love over here (bring it here)
One thing that I'm sure of, honey, mine won't disappear

Put it where you want it
Lay it on the line, (lay it down) you can share your love around
And I can share my time (can't share with nobody)
Put it where you want it, well that ain't hard to do
One man has to win your love, one of us has got to lose

I've been searching the whole wide world
But love like yours is so hard to find
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it
Put it where you want it, I just want you to know

Put it where you want it
That won't take much time
We can make the best of it and I could make you mine
Put it where you want it
Bring your love over here (bring it to me, bring it to me)
One thing that I'm sure of honey, mine won't disappear

I guess there must be a thousand guys who want you
But I'm the one who wants you the most
Put it where you want it...

// Show Your Hand //

I've been watchin' how you look at me
Tryna figure out what have I got to do to call
But you won't give me a clue
Now, people say I'm a gambling man
That I don't give away more than I can
But the stake's gettin' heavy
And I don't know if you're ready
For all the things I have in mind
I'll have to wait my time
Until you show your hand

Well, I've been advised not to mess around
Everybody said that you are a hard nut to crack
You say you don't give your love away
'Cause you might not get it back
But, this time I feel that I'm gettin' in deep
But in my heart, where my money used to be

Now the stakes are much higher
My soul is on fire
There's nothin' I can do
But seein' through

Show your hand
Would ya, show your hand?
Let me be a lovin' man, yeah
Show your hand
Well, just show your hand to me
Now, now, don't be afraid to lose, yeah
So even if it breaks me
You know you can take me
There is nothin' I can do

I've been advised not to mess around
Everybody said that you are a hard nut to crack
You say you don't give your love away
'Cause you might not get it back
This time I feel that I'm gettin' in deep
But in my heart, where my money used to be

Now the stakes are much higher
My soul is on fire
There's nothin' I can do
But seein' through

Show your hand
Would ya, show your hand
Let me be a lovin' man, yeah
Show your hand
Well, just show your hand to me
Now, now, don't be afraid to lose
So, come on, show your hand
Baby, I can make you understand
Show your hand
Show your hand
Even if it breaks me
You know you can take me
There is nothin' I can do
Still in love with you

// Back In '67 //

Back in '67 I could see my way to heaven with a rock 'n' roll band
Time was right for choosin' and working seemed like losin', some folks don't understand
Well, it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another 22 down below
But there's only one way to go, so we're movin' on

Now we have lunatics and crazies and 15 move and shakers, but jokes are clean
And from Egypt to Stonehaven the scenes have been amazing, well you know what I mean
But it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another thousand miles still to go
The company is getting slow, yes it is

As long as it's freezing that song keeps just squeezing me on, squeezing me on
But we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
Hm, you show me

Oh, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on

Well now, you name the places, we can show our faces anywhere that you want
And if the room has got a floor then there's room for thousands more, the field is there if you want
God, it's a 20-piece travelin' show, there's another 22 down below
But there's only one way to go, listen now

As long as its freezing that song keeps just squeezing me on, it's just squeezing me on
Well, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
Ah, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on, yes we have
Yeah, we just got to keep it movin', got to keep it movin' on
...

// Reach Out //

Reach on out and touch me
Give me thrills like I never had
Reach on out and touch me
You got something that is driving me mad

My head is reeling
Nobody ever had me feeling this way

Reach on out and touch me
Well I'm having a bad time waiting for your love
Reach on out and touch me
Keep it moving till I tell ya I've had enough

So come on keep it rising
The feeling is surprising to know (oh.. yeah)

You can take it all
Take it any way you like (oh.. yeah)

I said you can take it all
When you give it back sure gonna do it right (yeah yeah)

(That's what I'm talking about...)

Reach on out and touch me baby
This is what I wanted to know (yeah)
Reach out over here and thrill me with your love
Cause I ain't never had it this way before

Now you can feel it coming on
Just shake it one more time and I'll be gone

Reach out touch me
You better reach out (out, oh baby touch me)

// T.L.C. //

When we make music, we gotta make that with a swing
If we all keep it up, we can all get it out somewhere
When we make love it ain't no different, no
All a woman needs is a tender love and care

T L C it's short for tender love and care
It's all you gotta know (tender love and care)
But if you don't believe, it's not gonna get you anywhere
Keep pushing, still got a long way to go

T L C
And when you're working hard and there ain't much left to give
You know your love ain't going anywhere
That woman won't care about how much it takes to live
If you just get down and give her some of that thing that you got there

T L C
Tender love and care
That's all it needs
T L C
Tender love and care
Certain affection guaranteed

And when you feel that groove you better not miss what's going on
She's giving you the chance you gotta keep giving it all you can
No stop to think about it 'cause if you leave that girl without it
She's gonna find her TLC from some other man so keep on giving her

T L C
Tender love and care
It's all you need to make it
And you know she can thank it
T L C
Tender love and care
Whatever you do, you gotta do it right

'Cause you don't leave a woman lonely at night

Here it comes now
Whatever you do, you gotta do it right, yeah
T L C
As if only the woman lonely night
Gotta give her the action
T L C
You wanna get some savage back
Be the love you got
T L C
Do what you can, know where the flame is a heart
T L C
Whatever it is much to give
But whatever it is it's the way to live
