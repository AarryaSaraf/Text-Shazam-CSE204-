// The Spirit Of Love //

Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love

People say that it's the spirit of adventure
That keeps me here by your side
Drifting in and out of love the way that we do
Me and you, girl

They don't know about the things that we get up to
To keep our love in a line
Who could ever try to tame a spirit like you
I don't know

Just when I think I know you better
You turn and change your mind
But you don't even think about yourself
So why should I be so inclined

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love
Do it in the spirit, baby

People say that we're too crazy for each other
But I don't see it that way
They don't know about the spirit the way that we do
Me and you, girl

If anyone can do it better
Then let him speak his mind
But we don't need anybody's help, girl
I know we'll do just fine

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love
In the spirit of love

Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love
Do what you do, I just can't get enough
Take it from me in the spirit of love

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're thinking of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love

Do me right, do your stuff
Do anything that you're capable of
Treat me nice, play it rough
As long as you do it in the spirit of love

// Sticky Situation //

I told my girl
I had some business to attend to
I won't be stopping by tonight
I got sidetrack
Some place I've never been to
Taken in by the music and the lights
I saw this lady
Giving me the eye
I mean, for too long
She had me on the floor
Moving to the rhytm
Deep into the groove
When I saw my baby walking through the door

Now everytime I push my luck
Seems to snap right back at me
Now everyone could see
It was a sticky situation
It was, look at him girl
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

I look at her
She look at me
From the look we give each other
That was history

Out of nowhere
Two drinks in my face
And then on and on
They walk out of that place

And when they stop me with the bill
At an answer to injury
I didn't have enough to pay

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Love mine
Oh, no good
I'll tell you what it was

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face
It was a sticky situation
I got myself into another fine mess

It was a sticky situation
Couldn't look at the crowd
Got me with my face down
It was a sticky situation
Why do this things happen to me?
I don't know baby

It was a sticky situation
It was looking good
When it blew up in my face (in my face)

Sticky situation

// Aftershock //

Wo, wo, wo, wo-ah

Never, never should've let you go
Something got a hold of me
Sun don't shine, grass won't grow
Is this my reality?

I miss your flamin' red glasses
I miss your faded blue jeans
Baby, no warning
I break up this morning
Fallin' apart at the seams

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

Tellin' tale, what did I do wrong?
Can't you forgive and forget?
Never thought a day could be so long
Guess I ain't seen nothing yet

I miss your flamin' red glasses
I miss your faded blue jeans
Gone is the touch that I needed so much
All I've got left is the dreams

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

I wanna see our love
Get back on solid ground
Don't want to stand and watch
The world's now crumbling down, alright, hey, hey

Run to sunset boulevard
Girl, you're now sittin' right next to me
Knock the earth with your foot down hard
Make a living of history

Sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

I'm sufferin' from a
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Just about who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

Stuck in a holy wood
Aftershock
Ooh, I love you baby
And I just can't rub

See you get the world to do it
Who knows for
Look out, here comes another
Aftershock

// Love At First Sight //

I felt love when I walked into the room
Could it be
Love at first sight
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight

There was a certain look
From across the room
I knew I had to have you
Was this a feeling sign
You must know
I see that look in your eyes

The closer we get
Each beat of my heart
Keeps getting faster
This love you made me feel
Must be real
'Cause nothing else matters

I felt love when I walked into the room (I felt love)
Could it be
Love at first sight (Love at first sight)
I felt love, I'm not easily fooled
I know (I know)
It's love at first sight
Tonight

Girl won't you take a chance
On a new romance
I won't be too demanding
I'll give my heart to you
And all of my love
So please don't misunderstand me
Now (now) now that I felt your love (love)
What a special feeling
Now (now) now that I have your love (love)
Well girl I'll never leave you

I felt love when I walked into the room (I felt love)
Could it be (Could it be)
Love at first sight (Love at first sight)

Girl I'll never, never leave you
No I'll never leave you

Could it be

// I'll Get Over You //

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

Thought we were flying high
No sign of stormy skies in our way
But then a flash of light
Turned around and I was shot down in place
You expected a different reaction
I can't give you that satisfaction
Oh baby

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you
When I get over you, babe

What you gonna say when you see I'm already back on my feet? (Back on my feet)
What made you think that I would fall apart and be down on my knees? (Down on my knees)
You didn't hear me when I was callin'
The way you look, you're the one who's fallin'
Oh baby

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

You might find you're really out of my head
Oh, ask yourself, baby
Is this what you meant when you'll get over me?

I'll get over you
Over get over
I'll find someone new
I'll get over you
Over get over
And when I do babe
I'll get over

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over

I'll get over you, it won't take long
You'll see somebody who'll be twice as strong
Now I'm looking through different eyes
Honey, don't be surprised when I get over you

Oh no, baby
I tell you, it won't be long
I'm gonna be twice as strong
Uh-uh-uh-uh baby when I get over you
You expected a different reaction
I can't give you that satisfaction
Don't be surprised when I get over
Flying high on my body

// Later We'll Be Greater //

Later we'll be greater
Later we'll be greater

Later we'll be greater
Later we'll be greater
Later we'll be greater
Later we'll be greater

// Let's Go All The Way //

(All right)
I never knew what I was missing in love
For each time I had it right
And like a spirit that was sent from above
You are a new, inspiring light

Wanted to show me
Alone I couldn't find
The answer to these questions
Was with you all the time
And baby I know this
Is what I'm looking for
There's only one way
We can now for sure

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away
For you and I
Let's go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way

To satisfy love's greatest demands
Wherever they might lead us to
Make this feeling last as older we can
I wouldn't be here without you

Wherever we're going
I'll be by your side
There'll be no more questions
And nothing left to hide
Baby I know this (I know)
Is what I'm looking for
And what I'm up for it is so much more

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away
For you and I
Let's go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go baby

All the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's just a breath away
For you and I
We'll go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way
All of the way (oh baby)
(Stick to living)

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me please

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's not so far away (not so far away)
For you and I
We'll go all the way
Come with me, together
We will find a way
Let's go (let's go)

Let's go all the way
All the way 'cause
Heaven's just a breath away (just a breath away)
For you and I
We'll go all of the way, baby
Come with me, together
We will find a way
So, let's go all the way

Oh baby let's go all the way
All the way
Let's go all the way

// We're In Too Deep //

Oh my

I got to leave but something within won't let me turn around
Don't look at me, those eyes just pull me in and now I'm going down
It's getting late, the hands upon the wall begin to beckon me
Don't make me hesitate, you know there's somewhere else I really ought to be

But no matter how much I try to resist
You're making it hard to deny

That I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
I got to stay

Because I'm in too deep

Don't let me go, you're killing me with love and now I'm losing ground
I can't say no if this is how I'm gonna die then let me drown

And no matter how much I try to resist
You're making it hard to deny

That I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away, oh no
I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
I got to stay

You know I'm in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, I'm in too deep
My heart tells me
You know I got to stay baby

I'm way in over my head, believe me
I may be out of my mind
Its weight has hold of my say, but leaving
The ship won't sail out this time
'Cause I'm in too deep

What happens now, we've been loving, been talking half the night
No, there's no doubt, we've got to face it, there's gonna be a fight

Beause we're in too deep
In too deep
I can't break away
Oh no, we're in too deep
My heart tells me
Oh, I really wanna stay with you baby

In too deep
In too deep
I'm in too deep
I'm losing sleep
That secret side can't keep on
In too deep
My heart tells me

// Stocky Sachoo-A-Shun //

(Come on)
Let's go on the beat
Let's go on the beat
Still gets me
Let's go on the beat
Let's go on the beat
Let's go on the beat
Let's go on the beat
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Finessing on the beat)
(Finessing on the beat)
(Finessing on the beat)
