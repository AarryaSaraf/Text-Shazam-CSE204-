// You Got It //

Well you're making a big mistake, girl
Trying to hold back your love from me
'Cause there's nothin' I can't do for you
Sure got the love that you need

Everything, anything, in the world
If I can be your man
I would beg, borrow
I would steal for you, honey
As long as you understand

You don't have to worry
What more can I say
To make you understand
Oooh, I don't give a damn who knows it
You are the one, the one I truly need
Baby won't you listen to me

You got it, any way you want it
Any way you want it to be
You can have it, take it from me
'Cause it's waiting for you
You got it, any way you want it
Any way you want it to be
You can have it, take it from me
'Cause it's waiting for you

Now if something is on your mind, girl
Got to let me know right away
I will try my best to smooth it over
Nothing's gonna stand in the way
Anywhere, anytime, day or night
Don't make no difference to me
I will come running, way across town
As long as I know that you need

What I have to give
All that I can to make you feel all right

You got it, anyway you want it
Any way you want it to be
You can have it, take it from me
'Cause it's waiting for you
You got it, anyway you want it
Any way you want it to be
You can have it, take it from me
'Cause it's waiting for you
You got it, anyway you want it
Any way you want it to be
You can have it, take it from me
'Cause it's waiting for you
You got it, anyway you want it
Any way you want it to be...

// Got The Love //

Babe, you been gone such a long time
I've been thinkin' 'bout what it is we've got
Not all the time in the world, but we got a lot
There is much, much more than a ghost of a chance
We can make it right this time
'Cause you've got to stay mine

Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hid

You might not think that I care at all, but I do
You know me so much better than anyone else
It should be easy to convince you that I got the love

Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hid

So come on girl, let's work it out
C'mon and take my hand
'Cause I got the love

Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hid

// Pick Up The Pieces //

Pick up the pieces, uh-huh
Pick up the pieces, alright
Pick up the pieces, uh-huh
Pick up the pieces, woo!

Woo!

Pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces
Pick up the pieces
Woo!
Pick up the pieces
Wow!

// Person To Person //

Telephone line, bad connection
And I'm half asleep
Makin' conversation with you should be easy
But it ain't
Wish you could be with me
There would be no problem
Our communication's bad
And I want to see you again

Person to person, face to face
Person to person, one to one
Person to person, touching hands
Person to person, that's what love demands

Six weeks, long time to be without you sugar
But what can I do

Working hard on the other side of the world
Might as well be on the moon
Wish that I could write it all down
And put it in a letter to you
Feelin' like I do right now
Won't make it any better to you
Just got to be

Person to person, face to face
Person to person, one to one
Person to person, we can't replace
Person to person, that's just how it gets done

Person to person, line to line
Person to person, just keepin' time

// Work To Do //

I'm taking care of business, woman can't you see
Got to make it for you, got to make it for me
Sometimes it might seem that I've neglected you
But I would love to spend more time
I've got so many things to do

Oh I, got work to do, I've got work, baby
Got work to do, I've got to give it
Got work to do, I've got work to do
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah
I've been trying to make it, woman can't you see
Takes a lot of money to make it, let's talk truthfully
Keep your love light burning, and a little food hot in a plate
You might as well get use to me coming home a little late

'Cause I got work to do, I got work, baby

Got work to do, I've got to give
Got work to do, I got to work
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah
Work, work, yeah, work, work
Work, work, yeah, work, work
I'm taking care of business, woman can't you see
I got to make it for you, got to make it for me
But sometimes it might seem that I've neglected you
But I'd love to spend more time, I got so many things to do

'Cause I got work to do, I got work, baby
Got work to do, I've got to give
Got work to do, I got to work
Got work to do, got so much work, yeah yeah

// Nothing You Can Do //

It's real, you know you're with me all the time
No matter where you are
No one can steal your love
You gotta realize they won't get far

I can't give you up
No, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hang in tight
C'mon fill me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin'
You got to set it up
Ain't no use in runnin'

'Cause there's
Nothing you can do could make me
Stop lovin' you baby
Nothing you can say
Could make me break away

You're mine, but I can't do a thing about it
It takes time to get there
And I just wanna sing about it to ya, yeah

I can't give you up
No, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hang in tight
C'mon fill me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin'
You got to set me up
Ain't no use in runnin'

'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you baby
Nothing you can say
Could make me break away

// Just Wanna Love You Tonight //

I've got one evening left before I go
Don't want to spend it one my own
This time tomorrow I'll be on the road
So I got to get on the telephone
I need to see you girl, before I go away
Just got to have your love to remember
Your precious company, ooh
That's what I need today
I won't be back until September

You give me pleasure like I never had
I guess you know just what I like
Even if I'm not your only man
You make me feel as if I am

So tonight I want to have you to myself
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning light
Don't want you running to no one else
Just wanna love you tonight

There is a saying you better not forget
It's always come true for me
They say that what you see is what you get
And woman, you're all that I can see
That's why I'm asking you, oh just try and
Understand me, baby

This ain't time for silly games
And I'm a desperate man, can't you hear it in my voice
Without your love I just wouldn't be the same
So I'm putting my heart out to you, my love
Doing everything within my power
Now I've done my best - did I hear you say yes
I'll be round at your door within the hour

'Cause tonight I want to have you to myself
I'm leaving in the morning light
Don't want you running to no one else
Just wanna love you tonight

// I Just Can't Give You Up //

Got a message here that I hope you'll understand
When I met you keeping my distance was the plan
But hey, I never thought you'd get to me this way
I got you, and that's good

I was so scared that I would fall for you at first
Holding back with my love just trying to gain your trust
But now I'm not ashamed to say that
You've got my love in your pocket
And I'm hooked, can't you see

I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you 'n' my blood

I got to let you know that you really
Got a hold on me
I'm hooked can't you see

I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you 'n' my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my blood

// There's Always Someone Waiting //

There's always someone waiting
Looking over your shoulder
When you go to pick up the prize
That you've been working for
But don't tell me you've been taken
Everyday you get older
If you take a look inside
You don't have to look no more

There's always someone waiting
Trying to pick up your woman
And the time you think it's safe
Then she's been spoken for
Better watch out where it's going
Just in case it don't come back
And the money that you spend
Turns into days and nights
So I wonder, yes, I wonder who
Yes I wonder, well I really do
Who is waiting, who is waiting for me

There's always someone waiting
Looking over your shoulder
When you think you got it made
And everything is lemonade
But you never seem to get there
Someone's taken the cream
And you don't realize that
You're still stuck in between
There's always something creeping
Taking over you body
When you think you got control
It's getting closer to you
But you know that there's a reason
For the time that it takes
Trying to cut you down to size
Just when you start to fake

Yes I wonder, I wonder who
Yes I wonder, yes I really do
Might it be your next door neighbor
Maybe your agent or even your friend
I said be careful, tread wary
Be careful on who you depend

Well I just wonder, who is waiting for me
