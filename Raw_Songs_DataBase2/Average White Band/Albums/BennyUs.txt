// Keepin' It To Myself //

Now and again it occurs to me
I'm giving away much more than I ought to be
Oh, yes I am
And then today I get a letter
Telling me things that I better not believe
But I don't know if I can (just don't know if I can)

But you're the last in a long, long line of mistakes I've made
(They gonna do it again)
I'm tired of giving my heart and soul to a masquerade
So I'm gonna be

Keepin' it to myself
Let it build on up inside of me, yeah
I'll be keepin' it to myself
Baby, I tried, I tried

Well it makes no difference
I always thought that it was planned
When you get everything a man has to give
You know you got to return it (got to return it)
But every time I build my dreams (every time)
Find that love is not what it seems to be
And I keep on getting burned (keep gettin' burned by love)

But from now I'm gonna quit
Before I commit myself
To any woman I meet
And I'll get by without love for a while
And get into something else

I'll be keepin' it to myself
Let it build on up inside me, yeah, yeah
I'll be keepin' it to myself
Woman, I tried, oh babe

So I'll be keepin' it to myself
All to myself (never be alone, yeah inside of me)
Well, well, I'll be keepin' it to myself
Yeah honey I, I...
Don't you know, don't you know I try? (Keepin' it to myself)
Hey baby I try (all to myself) oh baby
Hey, yeah, I try! (Keepin' it to myself) yeah well

Sure though, I try
Say I ain't, ain't gonna tell nobody (keepin' it to myself)
I ain't gonna tell no one (all to myself)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be (keepin' it to myself)
Well yeah, I'll be...
Hey, ain't gonna tell nobody (keepin' it to myself)
I'll be keepin' it (all to myself)
Hey, hey, I'll be keeping it (to myself)
Sugar, I'll be...

// Get It Up For Love //

It's a tricky situation
Hard to say just what the outcome will be
If you saw the riddle you can save your soul
Chase love's shadow 'til the river's running cold

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

There's a longing in the people
No one knows just when the heartaches will cease
You can free and tell her, you can stay and fight
You can stand in line and scream, "Hey, it's just my right"

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

So, a smile, another fallin' star (ooh)
Tell us by the right side (ah, ah, ah, ah)
So long until we find
Just put your hand in mine, oh yeah

It's a tricky situation
Heaven knows just where the struggle must end
If it takes forever, I'd got the time above
I won't desert you when the tables have turned

Hey babe (hey babe), get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh)
Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh)

Get it up, get it up for love, babe
(Get it up, get it up for love)
Get it up, get it up for love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
All the way for love, get it up all the way

Aw, get it up (get it up for love) all the way
Get it up for love (get it up)
All the way (get it up for love) all the way
Get it up (get it up)

Oh baby, get it up (get it up for love)
(Get it up)
Get it up for love, get it up
(Get it up for love) get it up
(Get it up)

Get it up for love
Get it up for love
Get it up for love (get it up for love)
(Get it up)

(Get it up for love)
(Get it up)

// Fool For You Anyway //

Oh baby, oh baby
I thought I could make it without you, you know that
But I found out, found out
I need somebody to wake up with me early in the mornin'
And I found out I need someone to fix my food
Take good care of me

I'm so lonely
See I'm lonely
But I'm not lonely for anybody but you
And I gotta have you
I need your loving so bad
Woman I'm not ashamed
Not ashamed to say I need your lovin' so bad
Oh girl, mm-hmm

Well, I miss you, honey
A little more every day
And I know if I kiss you, oh babe
You'd be comin' back home to stay, yes you will

'Cause I know I was wrong, oh
But how long do I have to pay?
Oh babe
Do you know you belong here beside me?

I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, baby)

Well, I cried for you so long
Tears ran down like rain
And I tried to be so strong, so strong
But I felt every bit of the pain

You know your love left a mark on me
I don't think it would fade away (fade away) oh babe
I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home, baby
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
(Oh babe, oh babe)

You know your love put a mark on me
I don't think it would fade away (fade away)
I'll sit here and wait 'til you come home, honey
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, babe)
I'm a fool for you anyway (just a fool)
I'm a fool for you anyway (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)

I can't help myself (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Honey, I don't know what else (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)
I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Oh baby, I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)
I can come turn you on (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Sugar 'cause your love is strong (I'm a fool for you, I'm just a fool)

I'm a fool for you (I'm a fool for you, babe)
Oh baby, I'm a fool (I'm a fool for you, I'm just-)

// A Star In The Ghetto //

Broadway, you never shine a light on me
I may never live to see my name in lights on a Carnegie Hall marquee
Oh, but that's alright; Lord, that's alright with me
I'm as happy, happy as a man can be

Folks in New York may never know my name
I may not win that music Hall of Fame. (Music Hall of Fame)
Gonna keep on singing my song just the same
If I don't make it there, I won't be ashamed

'Cause I'm a star in the ghetto (I'm a star in the ghetto)
If I never make Broadway, that'll be OK (Keep on shining)
I don't care what the folks up there in New York...
(I'm a star in the ghetto)... got to say, oh no (Oh no)

Hollywood, (Hollywood) Hollywood will never be my style
But I know I'm good, oh yeah, not just alright
City lights, city lights (city lights) may never shine for me
I may never make it to the top, no, win myself a Grammy

Folks in New York may never know my name
I may not win that music Hall of Fame (Music Hall of Fame)
But I'm gonna keep on singing my song, whew baby, just the same
If I never make it there I won't feel ashamed

'Cause I'm a star in the ghetto (I'm a star in the ghetto)
If I never make Broadway, sugar, that'll be OK (Keep on shining)
I don't care what the folks up there in New York...
(I'm a star in the ghetto)... what they got to say, oh no (Oh no)

Think I'm gonna make it funky
Feel like getting down, y'all
Think I wanna make it funky
Feel like getting down, yeah

Blow your horn
Yeah, it's alright
Well, go blow your horn
They say it's alright
Feel the music
Feel the music

I'm a star in the ghetto (I'm a star in the ghetto)
If I never make Broadway, that'll be OK (Keep on shining)
I don't care what the folks up there in New York...
(I'm a star in the ghetto)... I don't care what they got to say Aww nah
I'm a star in the ghetto (I'm a star in the ghetto)
If I never make Broadway, sugar, that'll be OK (Keep on shining)
I don't care what the folks in Hollywood got to say
(I'm a star in the ghetto) I don't care anyway, aww no
I'm star (I'm a star in the ghetto) and I'm shining, and I'm shining
I'm a star (I'm a star in the ghetto) Yes, I am, yeah, yeah
(Keep on shining) I'm a star in the ghetto
If I never make Broadway, that'll be OK
If I never make it to Broadway...
(Keep on shining, keep on shining)... said that will be OK
People in New York City, ah, they don't bother me...
(Keep on shining, keep on shining)... not at all, not at all
I'm gonna make it the top (Keep on shining, keep on shining)
Among the distant stars, alright (Keep on shining, keep on shining)
Sugar, it's alright
I'm a star in the ghetto (Keep on shining, keep on shining)
I'm a star in the ghetto

Hold me so tight, so tight I can't breathe

// Someday We'll All Be Free //

Hang on to the world as it spins around
Just don't let the spin get you down
Things are moving fast
Hold on tight and you will last

Give yourself respect, your manly pride
Get yourself in gear
Keep your stride
Never mind your fears

Brighter days will soon be here
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

Keep on walking tall
Hold your head up high
Lay your dreams right up to the sky
Sing your greatest songs
And you'll keep growing, growing on

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Just wait and see, some day we'll all be free
Take it from me, someday we'll all be free

Take it from me
Take it from me
Just wait and see, someday we'll all be free
(Just wait and see)
All you have to do is wait and see
Wait and see

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free
Take it from me, oh, oh
Just wait and see, someday we'll all be free
(One day we'll all be free, just wait and see)

Take it from me, someday we'll all be free (take it from me)
(Take it from me)
Just wait and see, someday
One day, we will all
We will all be, we will all be free, free
(We'll all be free)
(We'll all be free)

// Imagine //

Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
I

Imagine no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine the people
Living life in peace
You

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll come and join us
And the world will be one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of men
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You

You, you, you may say I'm a dreamer
Oh, God knows that I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll come and join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine
A world of peace, imagine
No greed but harmony, imagine
Just sit down and think about it
We can live in harmony
If you just sit down and think about it

Imagine
Living in a world of peace
Sit down and think about it
Living in a world of peace
Use your imagination
