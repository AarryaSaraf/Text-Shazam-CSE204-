// GOOD TIMES //

Morning dew
Vaporised
Rays of sun
Blinding my eyes
I feel alive

Good times
(Don't you leave me now)
You'll find
Good times
(Got me crying out)
Down in the street

Lights out
Super power (Super power)
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
It feels like
There ain't nothing to lose

Good times
(Don't you leave me now)
You'll find
Good times
(Got me crying out)
Down in the street

Lights out (Lights out)
Super power (Super power)
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up (Light up)
The Eiffel Tower (The Eiffel Tower)
It feels like
There ain't nothing to lose

Good times
(Don't you leave me now)
You'll find
Good times
(Got me crying out)
Down in the street

(Good times)
Lights out
Super powers
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
(They're trying)
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
It feels like

Don't you leave me now
Got me crying out
Down in the street

Good times
(Don't you leave me now)
You'll find
Good times
(Got me crying out)
Down in the street

Good times
Good times
Good times
Good
Down in the street

Good times
Good times
Good times
Good
Down in the street

Good times
Good
Times, good-good
Times, good
