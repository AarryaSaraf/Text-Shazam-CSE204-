// Smile //

When you smile
When you smile the world feels a little better
I just wanna see you smile
When you try, when you try
The world moves over baby
I just wanna see you try

You better know one day
A little closer now to find in your way
Oh let the sons lead, let the sons lead the way

When you smile
When you smile the world feels a little together
This day wanna see you smile
You and I
You and I can take all the world
I just think of you and I

You better know one day
A little closer now to find in your way
So let the sons lead, let the sons lead the way

Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, no
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
I won't let you fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, oh, no
I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you

// Heavy, California //

(One day, she'll take the world from you)

Running baby, down the beach, yeah
They all tell me, I don't need ya now
Running baby, hold on
I'll be here for you

Just hold me, I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Just hold me, and we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California

Miss the sunlight, I was saying
Your love is amazing, so hold on to it for me
Come on baby, hold on
I'll be here for you

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California

Just hold me, I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Held up at the border
Just hold me, and we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away

Heavy, California
On the levee, can't afford you
They say heaven's waiting for you
So I'm headed for California

Oh Lord
California
Oh Lord
California

California

// Beat 54 (All Good Now) //

One love
You had it on your own love
Time up to be there
She said she won't care
And now you have something
Before you had nothing
And I want you care
But you lost real
And it's nothing
I cannot be your whole world
And sit on a fake grass
And I won't believe that
And I never had enough for you
But you said someone
Would come and replace me
How can you replace me?

While it's true, It's all good now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I
And this tears
Falling inside now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I

Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop
The video stop

One love
You had it on your own love
Time up to be there
She said she won't care
And now you have something
Before you had nothing
And I want you care
But you lost real
And it's nothing
I cannot be your whole world
And sit on a fake grass
And I won't believe that
And I never had enough for you
But you said someone
Would come and replace me
How can you replace me?

While it's true, It's all good now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I
And this tears
Falling inside now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I

I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
There's no time for me
I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
There's no time for me
I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
There's no time for me
I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me

While it's true, It's all good now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I
And this tears
Falling inside now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I

// Cherry //

You never gonna change me
You ne'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You ne'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

I wish I could protect you
That was all wasted
Flower something new
I wish I could perfect you
I was wrong they say
Now I'm over you

Flowers in the garden
That won't grow
Flowers on the train
It's not the same
Flowers in the garden
Life won't grow if we didn't change

You never gonna change me
I'm missin'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

You never gonna change me

I wish I could protect you
I was wrong they say
Findin' someone new
Now we stop the pretendin'
Kinda hard to listen
While they're talkin'

Flowers in the garden
That won't grow
Flowers on the train
It's not the same
Flowers in the garden
Life won't grow if we never change

You never gonna change me
I'm missin'
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'
You never gonna change me
You never gonna change me
I was already changin'

You never gonna change me

// Happy Man //

I'm a troubled man, I'm changed by the things I do
True but it's funny how they all remember you
It all could be different, try to do something new
Give it everything, oh, to be a happy man too
Got to understand, blamed by the friends I lose
Who's getting out of hand to think they depend on you?
It all could be different, try to do something new
Give it everything, oh, to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and you won't need nothing

Gonna run it 'round, strange but it just won't do, no
When it's coming down, taking a hold on you
It all could be different, try to do something new
Give it everything, oh, to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream

No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on

Closer
Turning it over
It all could be different
Closer
It's time to do something new
Give it everything, oh, to be a happy man too

Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream

No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on

// Casio //

Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year that's not original or cynical
Alright, let's go now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

Play it cool
I just want the keys back to my vehicle
They're just gonna tell you that it wasn't real
And I just wanna tell you this how I feel
I know you feel
I know you feel it too

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know It's over

Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year that's not original or cynical
Alright, let's go now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
(Alright, let's go now)
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
(Alright, let's go now)
Don't think that my love is gone
(Casio, alright, let's go now)
It's all up in your head now

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say
I know, you know it's over

When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long

Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now

// House In LA //

House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now

House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that
House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
House in L.A
Truly you care if I'm getting on that plane
So ask me to stay
Oh God, in the hope that you can heal my pain

I feel alive in the sunlight
All my fears are only real life
Yeah, I feel alive in the sunlight now
Two whole years on the rewrite
Tell my friends I'm gonna be right there

House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that
Cut through the haze
Lost in a camera and the whole night changed
Lost in L.A
But you won't care about that
Eyes full of rain
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
I should've stayed
Woke up in the hope that it could be alright

I feel alive in the sunlight
All my fears are only real life
Yeah, I feel alive in the sunlight now
Two whole years on the rewrite
Tell my friends I'm gonna be right there

House in L.A
You be the sunshine and it's alright now
Ask me to stay
But you won't say it like that
Ride down Sunset Boulevard
Try to find out who you are
Ride down Sunset Boulevard
Try to find out who you are

// Give Over //

Give over
You're not getting closer
It's over
You and I are so much older

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

Never gonna chase it
Never gonna chase it now

Give over
You're not getting closer
California
And all the times you were out there

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

Run free
Run free
Run free
Run free

Never gonna chase it
Never gonna chase it now

Give over
You're not getting closer
It's over
You and I are so much older

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone
I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone
I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone...
I said, said, said...
I know you're seeing someone...

// Cosurmyne //

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
How d'you do, baby?

Follow the memory
Reading my hand
I wanna feel you
To know I'm alive
'Cos I want a family, uh-uh-uh-uh

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't disappear

Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again
Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again

On my own
Hot spell on the roof I'm on
On my own
Tryna give in to find someone
Cosurmyne

Long as you're near me
Leading me there
A kiss on the surface
Then I got high
Decide what you're feeling
Tell me I'm dreaming

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear

Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again
Just get out of bed and forget it man
You're getting ahead of yourself again

On my own
Hot spell on the roof I'm on
On my own
Tryna give in to find someone

Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear
'Cos time has a way with us that makes me think it could all go wrong
Hope that cosurmyne
It won't dissapear

// Home //

Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights
Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights

Going nowhere
Hold tight
'Cos I don't know man
I ain't lying
Got a place to rely on
To get you home in ivy

Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home
Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home

Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights
Seems like I'm going nowhere
Streaming traffic lights

Going nowhere
Hold tight
'Cos I don't know man
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Hadn't told me
No one ever told me

Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home
Hands on a pistol only get you hung
A hand on her face will always get you home

Don't worry girl I haven't changed

// Pray //

Give me a reason to love you
Every night
'Cos I've seen life without you lately
And it hurts me
I've seen the visions
Of the bad times
In my head
But I won't let them take control of me

Every single night I pray
(I pray...)

Giving you a reason to trust me
Every day
But no one said this would be easy
And it hurts me
That I ever lied to you
In the bad times
It was in my head
But I won't let them take control of me

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by

(I pray...)

Tell me you need me
To love you
Anyway
It's not like we'll be here forever
And all of the decisions
You expected
That I never made
Come with the visions and the truth is

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by

'Cos I've seen life without you lately
And I wanna know just what the truth is
I've seen life without you lately
And I wanna know, I wanna know just what the truth is

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by
I can feel it
Passing by
