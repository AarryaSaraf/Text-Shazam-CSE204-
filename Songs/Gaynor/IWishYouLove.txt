Album: IWishYouLove

// Gotta Be Forever //

Let me hear a little backingtrack

I'm giving it up
I'm giving it up

I know you're wondering where I've been
Sweet songs of love got me comig in
Wanted to leave yeah, just walk away
But this is real and I'm here to stay
So afraid of being sad and blue
Talked to myself and said I'm over you
But now it's time for me to make you see 
These chains of love got a hold on me

I never felt this way before
Can't get enough, want more and more
Love will keep together
Got to be forever
Got to be forever

Never knew love would make me feel this way
You make me happy and I'm gonna stay
Whenever life was getting out of hand
I turned to you and you would understand
You lift me up when I'm feeling down
I got my feet back on solid ground
You make me smile when I wanna cry
I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die

I never felt this way before
Can't get enough, want more and more
Love will keep together
Got to be forever
Got to be forever

I'm giving it up
I'm giving it up
And I'm here to stay

I never felt this way before
Can't get enough, want more and more
Love will keep together
Got to be forever
Got to be forever

// Gone Too Long //

You said you'd never love another
Sweet words, empty promises
You swore you'd always be my lover
Look close, look into my eyes
You will realize... 
My heart just ain't for hire
Times change, a new day dawned
I ain't got time for your whim and desire
Look close, look into my eyes
You will realize (Oh oh oh oh)

You want my love but there's nothing on
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong
But you've been gone, gone, gone
Gone too long

While you were away, things got turned around
I found somebody who won't bring me down
No never again
No, look into my eyes you will realize (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

You want my love but there's nothing on
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong
But you've been gone, gone, gone
Gone too long

(While you were away) Oh, I learned to smile again
(While you were away) Oh, I learned to laugh again
(While you were away) Oh, baby everything's changed
For better, I got it together

(Can't change the way that I feel
This time my heart says it's real)

You want my love but there's nothing on
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong
But you've been gone, gone, gone
Gone too long

You want my love but there's nothing on
I wanna give but the feeling's gone  
We used to be right, baby don't take it wrong
But you've been gone, gone, gone
Gone too long

// Just No Other Way //

Here we are, alone again
In your arms again, and keeps on getting better
Well I don't need to read your mind
'Cause baby in your eyes, I can almost see forever

But before you go too far, before I fall too fast
Baby you should know, I need love that's gonna last
You gotta promise to be here
Through the laughter and the tears
Let me know that you're mine
Everyday, every night... 'cause

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me

Let me show you how much I care
And baby I swear, I'll be right there when you need me
But I gotta know that you'll always be true (always be true)
That you're gonna see this through
And give your heart completely

I wanna feel it when we kiss, believe when we touch
Babydon't just say you love me, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna see it in your eyes, believe it deep inside
I gotta know you'll be here
Everyday, every night ('cause)

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me

I will never ask for more than I'll give to you
(Gonna give me everything)
I wanna give him my everything
But I gotta know that my heart is true
Every day (every day)
Every night (every night)
For the rest of my life... 'cause
Commitment baby that's what I need
A heart that belongs only to me

I wanna feel it when we kiss, believe when we touch
Babydon't just say you love me, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna see it in your eyes, believe it deep inside
I gotta know you'll be here
Everyday, every night ('cause)

'Cause there's just no other way to love me
Just no other way to love me

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me

// I Never Knew //

It's really been a long time
Since I let somebody hold me
Since I felt safe in somebody's arms, emm emm
You were a good friend I could confide in 
But after all the lies he told me
I couldn't let nobody in my heart
I was torn apart
All this time you've been right here
He's been doing nothing but wrong
And though the best thing in my life was
Here with me all along

I never knew
Right beside me there was an angel
I never knew
You'd give my heart the wings to fly
Because of you
Everything in my life is changing
Turning it to 
The kind of heaven that I never knew

He kissed away my tears
And now they've disappeared
You made me feel safe in somebody's arms
You're the kind that can do me no harm
Can't let up
Can't tell anybody that you're not from around here
They don't know that you're an angel
But now it's all so clear

I never knew
Right beside me there was an angel
I never knew
You'd give my heart the wings to fly
Because of you
Everything in my life is changing
Turning it to 
The kind of heaven that I never knew

Is this a dream
Are you for real
You got me honey
Feeling things that I never thought I'd feel
You taught me love 
Don't have to break my heart in two
That's just one more of those things
That I never, never knew
I never knew
Right beside me
There was an angel 
I never, never knew (that my heart could fly)
It's all because of you baby
My life is changing
Turning it to
The kind of heaven that I never knew

// All The Man That I Need //

Precious darling, you know you're my man
All you got to do is wave your hand
Yes, I cherish all you got to give
I don't need nothing' else to live

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love

Taste that honey flowin' from your lips
I start shakin' from your fingertips
[?] steady, movin' right on time
Feel so warm in these arms of mine

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love

Now darlin', when I'm with you
Say, it feels so good inside
It's just makin' love to you
I'm so satisfied

All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is to feel it comin'
All I need is your sweet lovin'
All I want is your love
Yeah, baby

// Just Keep Thinking About You //

Alll...the time
Tell me why, just keep thinking about you baby

Tell me if you can
Why I keep thinking about you baby
Ain't at all like I just wanna
I just keep thinking about you baby
Lord knows I got things to do
But they are all neglected
Pushed aside by you
There is just no time
And my head gets crowded
Ohh yeah, you're always on my mind

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

There is no way
I'll stop thinking about you baby
You go with me day to day
I can't stop thinking about my baby
Just a simple story
About a lonely lady
Finding herself in love
And that is amazing
I won't be complaining
That means I would not change a thing 'cause

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

A happy ending to my story
And all because of you
You tell me that you loved me
And I believe you doo
I'm gonna be so patient
Baby just take your time
Our love keeps growing stronger
And stronger all the time

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

Just keep thinking about you baby (day and night)
Tell me I (Just keep thinking about you baby)

// Stronger //

Used to hear me say
Baby, I need you, I'm lonely and deprived
And without your love I can't get through the day
When you're gone my world just slowly fades away
And I

Gave you my lovin' every time you asked
Gave my heart, held nothing back
Now I see that you couldn't handle that
Oh, how things have changed

Maybe it was that I was insecure
That won't happen anymore
That was before
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same

I've feel stronger than you know
Strong and now I can do without you
The pity that you show

So don't mistake me for a fool
Made a mistake
My only problem was loving you
I'm stronger now

Used to cry and cry
Sit around and wait for you to dry my eyes
And I know you're thinking here we go again
Your broken heart that I have to mend

Gave you my lovin' every time you asked
Gave my heart held nothing back
Now I see that you couldn't handle that
Oh, how things have changed

Maybe it was that I was insecure
That won't happen anymore
That was before
No, I'm not, no, I'm not the same

I've feel stronger than you know
Strong and now I can do without you
The pity that you show

So don't mistake me for a fool
Made a mistake
My problem was loving you
I'm stronger now

Oh, you know I used to love you
But oh, my friend, I can live without you
Don't need your sympathy
I'm letting you go free

It used to be so predictable
So innocent and so simple
I can tell that you're surprised
I'm someone you don't recognize

I've feel stronger than you know
Strong and now I can do without you
The pity that you show

So don't mistake me for a fool
Made a mistake
My problem was loving you

I've feel stronger than you know
Strong and now I can do without you
The pity that you show

But don't mistake me for a fool
Made a mistake
My problem was loving you
I'm stronger now

// No One Can Love You More //

Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love (give you all my love)
Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love

I used to be on my own
Every night, every day by myself
Feeling so far from home
How would I know I would go
Down the road that would lead me right into your arms
Destiny told me that you were the one
Stars fill the sky now I've finally found you

No one can love you more
No one can give it all
I'm gonna give you all my loving
No one can love you more
I'll give you my heart and soul
Feel it deep down inside

Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love (give you all my love)
Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love

I thought I was wasting time
Living in hope that I'd find a new love
Love can be so unkind
How could it be you and me took so long
To discover that dreams do come true
Everything's changed since the day I met you
The sun's gonna shine every time we're together

No one can love you more
No one can give it all
I'm gonna give you all my loving
No one can love you more
I'll give you my heart and soul
Feel it deep down inside

No one can love you more
No one can give it all
I'm gonna give you all my loving
No one can love you more
I'll give you my heart and soul
Feel it deep down inside

Yesterday has gone
And from this moment on you will see
This will be a forever lasting love

Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love
Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love

No one can love you more
No one can give it all
I'm gonna give you all my loving
No one can love you more
I'll give you my heart and soul
Feel it deep down inside

No one can love you more
No one can give it all
I'm gonna give you all my loving
No one can love you more
I'll give you my heart and soul
Feel it deep down inside

Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love
Give you love [2x]
I'm gonna give you all my love, all my love

No one can love you more [3x]
