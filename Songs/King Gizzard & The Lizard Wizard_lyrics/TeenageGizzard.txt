// Good To Me //

Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me

Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me

Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
Girl hear what I say, girl hear what I say
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me
You ain't good to me, you ain't good to me

// Tomb / Beach //

Wooooo, woooooo

Lie in the whirl
Makes you hurt
Lie in the sky
Makes you high

In my tomb, in my tomb
In my tomb, in my tomb

Lie in the whirl
Makes you hurt
Lie in the sky
Makes you high

In my tomb, in my tomb
In my tomb, in my tomb

Going down, now
To the beach, now
You look fine, yeah
Like a beach, yeah
Going down, now
To the beach, now
You look fine, yeah
Like a beach, yeah
