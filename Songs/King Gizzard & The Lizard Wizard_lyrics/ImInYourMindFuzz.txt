// I'm In Your Mind //

Everybody's lazy when they're tired
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride
And everybody's filing into line
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh

While everybody wants to suck you dry
And dig a little deeper in your mind
C'mon, deeper
Everybody's lazy because they're fried
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind, oh

// Cellophane //

Do do do do...

You can watch your movies in 3D
It's so strange

With cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, oh
Do do do do...

You can colour everything you see
It's so strange

With cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, oh
Do do do do...

You can watch your movies in 3D
It's so strange

With cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, cellophane
Cellophane, oh
Do do do do...

// I'm In Your Mind Fuzz //

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind

When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind

Everybody's lazy when they're tired
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride
And everybody's filing into line
Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

When I'm in your mind

// Empty //

Empty
Love is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Love is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty

Life is death
It's because I shot it through its head
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
Feeling so empty

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Love is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty
What I got myself into
What I got myself into
Empty

What I got myself into
What I got myself into

// Hot Water //

Water, hot water
Hot water, hot water...

Eat up, vomit
Date line, repay
System, failure
Wish for old way
Straighten, bend it
Decline, spend it
Believe, sceptic
Everybody's standing in

Hot water, hot water...

Sheet of paper
Mountain raper
Moment silence
I am spineless
Echoes, ending
Whispers, trending
Heat is coming
Everybody's stranded in

Hot water, hot water...

// Am I In Heaven? //

I've got ideas in my brain
About the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain
Will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

Well everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear even the oceans changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear even the sky has changed, its blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

Well everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear even the ocean changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
Come on, suck our mother's breast!

I've got ideas in my brain
About the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain
Will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh if we save her, we'll live on a star
'Cause Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

// Slow Jam 1 //

I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low

And when it feels like coming on
Boy it makes it hard to talk
For me, for me

I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low

And when it feels like coming on
Boy it makes it hard to talk
For me, for me

// Satan Speeds Up //

You brought us to your gift of generosity
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils

When I stop to think of all that..

Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils

When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door

Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
He's watching you
And passing judgement to everybody you hold dear

And when I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door
Who's he looking for?

// Her And I (Slow Jam 2) //

I had to put up some kind of a fight

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

Because everyday I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

Because everyday I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

Because everyday I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
