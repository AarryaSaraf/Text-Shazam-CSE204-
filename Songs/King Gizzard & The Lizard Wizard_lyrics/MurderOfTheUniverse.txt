// Altered Beast II //

[Narrator:]
Now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you weep crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread, oh

I won't quit
If you quip
See to it
That you slip, oh

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator:]
To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast, oh

[Narrator:]
What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home, oh

I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head

[Narrator:]
I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast

// Alter Me II //

[Narrator:]
Your dumb human head is full of naivetÃ©
Your impending fate, is to be one with me

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

[Narrator:]
Now we cross to our friend on the monster's plate
In time he will turn and reincarnate

// Alter Me III //

[Narrator:]
No more consternation, no longer insalubrious
The beast's DNA has dug into your nucleus

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

// Altered Beast IV //

[Narrator:]
You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you

I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never!

True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never!

I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator:]
You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac

Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And gone is all that's visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything

[Narrator:]
The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
I think I see
An altered beast inside me, oh!
I am an altered beast

// Life / Death //

Are you you? Are you me?
Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than you are worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the Earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die

// The Lord Of Lightning //

Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in his wake

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[Narrator:]
One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh!

[Narrator:]
And from the Lords electric snare
One goes in his electric chair

Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake

[Narrator:]
His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

[Narrator:]
And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught a light
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night

// The Balrog //

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep!

You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!

[Narrator:]
Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored

Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!

You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog

[Narrator:]
I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at it's expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot

Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, oh!

Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, yes, oh!

[Narrator:]
For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemathe
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned
