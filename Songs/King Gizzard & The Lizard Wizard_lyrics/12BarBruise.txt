// Elbow //

You want? You got?
You are such a big shot
You cunt, you know me better
Than to bend my elbow back

Oh, hey, hey, hey...

You want? You got?
You are such a big shot
You cunt, you know me better
Than to bend my elbow, bend my elbow
Stab me in the back!

Oh, hey, hey, hey...

// Muckraker //

Clear the cobwebs off my brain
Ants have caves, it's not that great
And piss and shit upholds the flood
I'll rake them up, it's just my luck

Oh no...

Ah ah ah...
Muckraker, oh muckraker
Muckraker, muckraker, oh!

Clear the cobwebs off my brain
Ants have caves, it's not that great
And piss and shit upholds the flood
I'll rake them up, it's just my luck

Oh no...

Ah ah ah...
Muckraker, oh muckraker
Muckraker, muckraker
Muckraker, muckraker, oh!
Ah ah ah...

// Nein //

Never, never, never, never again
Had much, too much, I'm sick of it
My body's full of poison shit
Never, never, well, ha ha, ha, ha! (Shit, never again)

Shit, never again

One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!

Shit, never again

One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein!

Well, never, never, never, never again
Had much, too much, I'm sick of it
My body's full of poison shit
Never, never, well, ha ha, ha, ha! (Shit, never again)

// 12 Bar Bruise //

I'd better be slave
I'd make some money
And so when it gets ruff
We can bruise some stuff
But look at my dick
I bet you it's limp
Should I quit drink
It makes me think that...

12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise, oh

I've gotta be strong
Make me live long
I'd better not wait
For a bottle's sake
All of my friends are
Looking up dresses
They have not seen
The bruise that I've seen

Bruise... wooh!

I'd better be slave
I'd make some money
And so when it gets ruff
We can bruise some stuff
But look at my dick
I bet you it's limp
Should I quit drink
It makes me think that...

12 bar booze is 12 bar bruise, oh

I've gotta be strong
Make me live long
I'd better not wait
For a bottle's sake
All of my friends are
Looking up dresses
They have not seen
The bruise that I've seen

Bruise... wooh!...

// Garage Liddiard //

My head, oh my head
My head's all bleak
And it makes my love so rough
My knees, oh my knees
My knees are weak
And it makes for walking tough

Ow! Ow! Ow!...

My head, oh my head
My head's all bleak
And it makes my love so rough
My knees, oh my knees
My knees are weak
And it makes for walking tough

Ow! Ow! Ow!... Ouch!...

// Sam Cherry's Last Shot //

Early that morning, the wagonmaster of the train came into the post, pretty excited and reported the dead body of a man and horse had been found in the road about six miles from the post. A company of infantry was immediately ordered out and proceeding to the spot, found the body of Sam Cherry, pinned fast to the ground by the dead body of his horse. The search was continued, and in the lateral canyon, they found the bodies of Sargent Love and the three privates loaded with bullets, mutilated and disfigured. Getting every evidence and having sold their lives as great men should, trails were examined and the whole story worked out. The party traveled along the road, nearly to the entrance of the canyon of the Olympia, then was a wild rose pass, and suddenly about 39 Indians dashed from the bushes along the stream, cutting off the retreat towards the fort, and trotted it up the lateral canyon. Suspecting a trap, Sam Cherry suddenly turned, dashed through the line of Indians, regained the road, and ran for life away from the fort, followed by a number of yelling savages. He was evidently doing well when his horse stumbled and fell, breaking his neck, bringing Sam's leg to the ground. In an instant, he was surrounded by the exact Indians. Raising himself slightly, Sam fired five shots at these Indians. Turning the muzzle against his own temple, he escaped the tortures of their vindictive rage by his last shot. The baffled and terrified Indians went away as fast as their ponies could carry 'em, not touching the body, not even taking the arms. Such is the way out in the west. People die, extreme barbaric ways. If you're taking their land, in turn, they take out viscera, spread it across the desert.

// High Hopes Low //

Well I ain't dumb
But I ain't that smart
And I can't spell
But I can sound it out

Gotta keep your high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low

Well I ain't dumb
But I ain't that smart
And I can't spell
But I can sound it out

Gotta keep your high hopes low
High hopes low, high hopes low, oh!
High hopes low, yup

Well I ain't slow
My high hopes low
My high hopes low
My high hopes low
My high hopes low, oh
High hopes low

// Cut Throat Boogie //

As a child I felt inclined
To fold my ears in twine
Never once was I confined
I picked and choosed about my ride
So buckle me in before we set sail ahead
For it smells like cabbage
Got way too stale like death

Oh you're white as a ghost, I never felt so pale
As the blood dripped across the floor

So put it buried in your chest
With the rest of your drunken regrets
Inches from your jugular
As the room fills in front of ya
It took them long enough
For them to stop and suggest
Hey we better get him some help
We better get him out of here

How did I manage to cope as the blood soaked
Through my clothes and to the floor
From outside to the bathroom door
I was inches from my life
Yeah that's what keeps me up at night

Oh how did I survive you should'a died
How did I manage to cope being alive
After all it was just a innocent play fight
I hope they don't stop to sympathize
Oh, stitch up the past to cure their whoremented heart, ah
Oh, tormented dreams it's all left in between

// Bloody Ripper //

Push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
Oh, it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"

And push me down, I will not crack
You're just a monkey with your claws in my back
I said it, and you heard
That Vecky bottle's cutting me some slack

But it's like all I wanna do
Sink my teeth in you
You already told me to
You said, "It's alright"
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, oh, oh, oh...

// Uh Oh, I Called Mum //

Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!

I bought a funny glob
I put it in my gob
I had anxiety
I couldn't help myself
But call mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!

Mum mum mum...

I bought a funny glob
I put it in my gob
I had anxiety
I couldn't help myself
But call mum, oh!

Uh oh...
I called mum!
Uh oh...
I called mum!

Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum-mum-mum-mum-mum!

// Sea Of Trees //

Oh hell, I'm feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I'm feeling kinda sick
I don't know what's the use in it
And when you're feeling suicidal
Sometimes you've just got to unfold

Oh hell, I'm feeling underwater
My head is sinking like a stone
And hell, I'm feeling like a prick
I don't know what's the use in it
And when you're feeling suicidal
Sometimes you've just got to unfold

I love to go down to Waverley Park
I'm gonna sit on the wing
I'm gonna eat a pie
I'm gonna buy a Footy Record for a dollar-fifty
I'm gonna have a full-strength beer, you girl
I'm gonna take a specky
I'm gonna kick a banana
I'm gonna eat a banana
I am gonnaâ¦ loving every second of it
I hate what this game has become
Footy
