// Third Eye (Live) //

"Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself, you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself, question authority. Think for yourself... Think for yourself... Order... Regulations... Rules... Think for yourself, question authority. Order... Regulations... Rules... Comfort us..."

Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

In... out... in... out... in... out...

A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

"So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?"

Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

"So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?"
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?"

Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding
And you thought that I had run away
Chasing the tail of dogma

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
And there we were

I opened my eye
I opened my eye
I opened my eye
And there we were

So good to see you once again
I thought that you were hiding from me
You thought that I had run away
Chasing a trail of smoke and the reason

Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye
Prying open my third eye

// Part Of Me (Live) //

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

You are a part of me

You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me
You are just a part of me

Give it up

You don't speak
You don't judge
You can't leave
You can't hurt me
You're just here for
Me to use

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you better than I know myself
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself
I know you well, better than one might think
I know you better than I know myself

I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than anyone
I know you well. You are a part of me
I know you best, better than one might think
It's time for you to make a sacrifice
It's time to die a little. Give it up

I know you best, better than anyone
I know you better than I know myself

A part of me

// Pushit (Live) //

"We've been... we've been trying something a little different this tour. We've been looking at one of our songs from a different angle, under a different light, so we can hopefully kind of see it almost for the first time. We'd like to try that for you tonight, is that okay? We're gonna need your help though. We're gonna need your help and your permission, so we need you to find a comfortable space, that's not only comfortable, but vulnerable. I want you to shut your eyes and go there, and we'll meet you on the other side..."

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear
If I do, we both may disappear

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you as well, my dear
And you as well, my dear
Pushed you away, my dear
Pushed you away
Pushed you away
Pushed you away, my dear

I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What are you but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you

Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You'd better take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear
If I do, we both may disappear

But you're pushing, and I'm shoving you
And you're pushing me, and I'm shoving you
You still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And we're pushing, and I'm shoving
And you still love me, you still love me
You still love me, you still love me
You're pushing, and we're shoving
And I'm pushing, and you're shoving

And I'm slipping back into the gap again
I feel alive when you touch me
I feel alive when you hold me
Down

Slipping back into
Slipping back into

I am somewhere I don't wanna be, yeah
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again

Saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear

If when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way

Pushing and shoving
Pushing and shoving
Pushing me
There's no love in fear

Staring down the hole again
Hands around my back again
Survival is my only friend
Terrified of what may come, yeah

Remember I'll always love you
As I claw your fucking throat away
It will end no other way
It will end no other way

// Message To Harry Manback II //

// You Lied (Live) //

Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant? Oh...

Time heals, time congeals around us
Endless hours of wasted moments
Understanding, not demanding
Your eyes tell what you feel inside

Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone
Inside sleeping, my heart beating
You know that you tried to hide it
Shouldn't you have said what you meant?

You lied!

// Merkaba (Live) //

It's some kind of psychedelic experience...

Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is light, we are immortal
Our body is love, we are eternal...
Eternal...

Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, without judgment...

// No Quarter //

Lock all the doors, kill the lights.
No one's coming home tonight.
The sun beats down and don't you know?
All our lives are growing cold, oh...
They bring news that must get through.
To build a dream for me and you, oh.

Locked in a place where no one goes.

They ask no quarter
They have no quarter.

Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight

It's getting colder [7x]
Locked in a place where no one goes.

Lock the door, kill the light
No one's coming home tonight

They bring news that must get through.
Dying peace in me and you

Locked in a place where no one goes.

We have no quarter
We have no quarter
We ask no quarter

// Maynard's Dick //

It's all an open center
Opens up and lets the wind lift him away
It doesn't have to feel water
It's just a place that feels right with him 
Kinda like the way you're breathing
I kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to glide on
Slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard's dick

There's a shyness found in reason
Apprehensive influence swallow away
You seem to feel abysmal take it
then you're careful grace for sure 
Kinda like the way you're breathing
Kinda like the way you keep looking away
Would you like to climb on
Climb on my six inches and go down on Maynard's dick

Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Put it right on top of your forehead
Took you out in the back of the toolshed
Now you know what you're fuckin with... Maynard's dick!
