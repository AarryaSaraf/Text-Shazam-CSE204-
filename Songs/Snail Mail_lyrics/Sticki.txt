Album: Sticki

// Untitled //

I had a dream it was on my ceiling
I had a feeling it was in my head
If I walk outside every time it's freezing
I have to wonder if it wants me dead again

And it's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

I'm not afraid to walk without a way
If I close my eyes I'm scared I'll never get to leave the grey
I wanna sleep and never leave my bed
And then I won't hesitate to call it my friend again

And it's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over
It's not something I can run my hands over

Oh, never sleep again
Oh, never sleep again

// Feeling Better //

I thought I was dreaming
'Til the light came through the door
It was more than just a dream
I believed I was drowning
So what'd you wake me up for?

I don't see anyone
Standing in front of me
There's a voice in my ear
Sees what they're not supposed to see
I thought I knew better
Feeling like so much more
Now that I feel so much better
I know that I don't feel any different

I've been anxiously staring at walls for days now
Just waiting on a reply
Oh god will you tell me that I'm not just screaming into silence
So I can know when I've tried

I don't see anyone
Standing in front of me
There's a voice in my ear
Says that I'm not all I'm supposed to be

And all the silence
Cause I'm the only one asleep
It's all dying down
And I know cause I don't feel any different

// Ghost //

Oh, sweet voice
Where have you gone now?
I know if it were your choice
I would be beside you

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room

Do you feel trapped in being your own shadow
I don't see it like that but what would I know

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

Ghost in my wall
Do you see you wither to no one at all
Guide me to nothing
To places where there is no one
The world will lead your body
To [?] the ground that binds you
So you'll fall above your shoulders
And now I can't even remind you

I am alone in this room
There is no you
I am alone in this room
There is no you

Headfirst now
Go on turn around
Leave it to yourself
No one's gonna help you now

Headfirst now
Leave it to yourself
No one's around
No one's gonna help you now

// Fluorescent Heights //

Quiet hours
Nothing now
Always an absence
Drowned out
What if instead
No one hears whatâs unsaid
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
Glow of the bug light
How they always fly
To fluorescent heights

I canât see me in my own my eyes
Only boxes to run and hide
Five AM and I know it now
I need to find a way out
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
I lose myself every night
To fluorescent heights
I want to be alright
Fluorescent heights
