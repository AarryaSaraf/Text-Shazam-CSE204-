// Play The Game //

Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide

It's so easy
When you know the rules
It's so easy,
All you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game,
Everybody, play the game of love (yeah)

When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go

This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game,
Everybody, play the game of love
Ooh, yeah

My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane
Come, come, come, come, come play the game, play the game, play the game, play the game

Play the game
Everybody, play the game of love

This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, yeah
Play the game of love

Your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Play the game of love, of love

// Dragon Attack //

Ooh, yeah

"Take me to the room where the red's all red
Take me out of my head"'s what I said

// Another One Bites The Dust //

Oh! Let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm gonna get along
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Look out!

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey!
Oh, take it
Bite the dust
Bite the dust, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh

Shout!

There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he's down, yeah

But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat

Oh, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright

// Need Your Loving Tonight //

Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey

No, I'll never look back in anger
No, I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines

I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

I must be strong so she won't know
How much I miss her
I only hope as time
Goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love
Love, love, love her

Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you, baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?

Ooh, I need your loving tonight
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving, baby, tonight
(Hit me)

Ooh, I need your loving tonight

No, I'll never, look back in anger
No, I'll never, find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

// Crazy Little Thing Called Love //

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing (this thing) called love (called love)
It cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night
It swings (ooh, ooh), it jives (ooh, ooh)
It shakes all over like a jelly-fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock-n-roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

Yeah

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
(Ah hum, ah hum)
And take a long ride on my motorbike
Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie)
Crazy little thing called love

This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it
I ain't ready
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Crazy little thing called love

Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah
Crazy little thing called love, yeah, yeah

// Sail Away Sweet Sister (To The Sister I Never Had) //

Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?

Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away, sweet sister
Always be in love with you

Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
Ooh, you know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah

Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who loves you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down my friend
Sail away, sweet sister
Back to my arms again

Hot child, don't you know, you're young?
You got your whole life ahead of you
Ooh-ah, you can throw it away too soon
Way too soon, yeah

Sail away, sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you find somebody
Who's gonna love you half as much as me, yeah
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away, sweet sister
Always be in love with you

// Coming Soon //

I get some headaches
When I hit the heights
Like in the morning
After crazy nights, yeah
Like some mother-in-law
In her nylon tights

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

You take them, the same old babies
With the same old toys
The neighbors screaming
When the noise annoys
Somebody nagging you
When you are out with the boys

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

They're, they're
They're, tonight

They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

// Save Me //

It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried

The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I'll love you 'til I die

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted?
All that love?

I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you 'til I die (Ow!)

Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah)
Yeah, save me (Yeah)
Save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh (Save me)
I'm naked and I'm far from home
