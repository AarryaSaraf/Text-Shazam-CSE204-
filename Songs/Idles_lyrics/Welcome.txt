Album: Welcome

// 26/27 //

I've been on the back seat
Driving around for days
There's nothing more to see here
Look up with a glaze
I was told that life is too short
You reap what you sow
But they jump in the cold wind blind
What the fuck do they know?

I did what I was told
My body's getting old
I don't want to go your way
I woke up too early
With visions of the sea
I will never go to school

Today's the day we wait

We are not both the same
But we will fade away
We are not both the same
But we will fade out

Don't know my own weathered hands
And much of what they do
My faith was put in reprimand
And much of what is new
I can see my grave here
Holding onto you
Baby if you draw me out
You'll confiscate the view

Got my own ideas
I'll try to be sincere
I will never go your way
Who the hell are you
To celebrate your views?
Your cowardice on weak display

Today's the day we wait

We are not both the same
But we will fade away
We are not both the same
But we will fade out

Brothers in the back
Waiting for lungs
Waiting for lungs
Waiting for...

Hey look here
With your holocaust lovers
And your old pullovers
And you faux first smiles again
Claiming you're a nonconformist
To rags, wheels, hide what you feel

What a fear
What a fear
What a fear

Falling into the ocean as it chops and cracks
Dance in eternal darkness
Your lungs are harnessed never to see day again

What a fear
What a fear
What a fear

Fallen on the bathroom floor
Tired of the rising shore
Bleeding on the bathroom floor
Laying on the bathroom floor

What a fear
What a fear
What a fear

I love it how you love me so
Then you come and take my culture and go
I'll never tell you what I know
I'll never tell you what I know

What a fear
What a fear
What a fear

Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?
Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?

You'll never be another lover
Another lover, another lover
You'll only be a poor relation
Poor relation, Poor relation

You'll never find your powerful roar
Powerful roar, powerful roar
You'll never find your powerful roar
Powerful roar, powerful roar

What a fear
What a fear
What a fear
What a fear, fear, fear

Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?
Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?
Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?
Hey, mayday
You wanna save me, save me?

Better son, better son
I know I should have been a better son
Makes me feel like the one, the one

Surrey, surrey
Sat in the dark in his latter days
Makes me feel pretty strong, strong

Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum

Murder, murder
You said you're too soft for murder
Makes you feel pretty strong, strong

Can't lay, can't lay
Mother of two kids from Adelaide
Makes you feel pretty strong, strong

Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum

Medicine, medicine
I know that I need some medicine
But it won't make me feel strong, strong
Holiday, holiday
I know you want to go on holiday
But it won't make you feel strong, strong

Away/Oh why

Don't be afraid son, you're not alone

You gotta love me! Love me! You gotta love me!
I'm the one that hits you in the face
I'll be the one who puts you in your place
D- d- d- d- d- d- don't you think?
Don't you think?

Huoh!
