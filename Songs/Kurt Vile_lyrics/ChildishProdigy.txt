// Hunchback //

I've got a hunchback big as a humpback whale
ain't a damn man on earth now who could cure it

In the morning I'm begging please don't make me wake it
but I've got a will, know what big as my hunchback

Floppin an flippin around like a fish on the sheet
floppin an flippin around like a fish along the sand
floppin for dead uptown like when a fish drowns outta water

Left a man neck deep in dirty wood
turned your back when he was down bound

Oh I've got a hangover make you just wanna keel over
You don't gotta stick a four-leaf clover in your pants you got no chance

In the morning I'm pleading please
but I've got a will we all know by now, big as my hunchback

To get up on top these days you gotta be a low life trick just to
slither up just like a snake upon a spiral staircase

// Dead Alive //

You're telling me a good man is hard to find well what are you blind?
Well never mind let's try and have a good time
There was a war of independence if a man's a hindrance well you know where you've got a right to go

Better take a breather till you're better till you're breathin till you stop sweatin
Better take a breather till you stop sweatin and knit me a sweater

You're tellin me a good man is hard to find,
What was that? you better rewind
Cos there's me mama, I'm showin everybody a good time
You're always lookin for a few good men well here's one
Baby, won't get wasted on a gun

Call me old dog when I'm gone but when I'm back it's always
Oh man where ya been so long, where ya been so long
And then since then it's just been alright, a-okay
Ain't always oh man where ya been so long where ya been so long
In a world that gets me high I'm tied up in all the time

// Overnite Religion //

You were all alone got into this song
Anyway it's strung to, it wont quit
Never mind time, let the good times

Hear my my guitar, chiming and climbing
Finding all the notes that nobody wrote
In all that time, making it my religion

Thinking is rhyming
And click track timing
Finding all the words, that nobody's heard
And in that time, emitting my sweet vision

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Talking and strumming
Swooning and tuning
When you looking sick, I'll alleviate it
Each chord I lay a shape
Make you awake, before you break

Overnight sensation, my all night and now a religion
Digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion

Keep all along
I wrote you this song
For the one's I know made it back
For the friend's I haven't had
For my sisters, brothers moms and dads
They are all my friends in a church beneath my chest
Hanging over me all night, it's alright

I'm digging on my sweet vision of overnight religion
Comes to me like, like
It comes to me like, yeah

// Freak Train //

Go ahead tell me hello or fuck you
Whatever introduction suits you
I ain't tryin' to fight
I'm just tryin' to ride this train to make it home tonight

Hey, I don't get it kid
Are you tryin' to break my nose
Or just stand around and stare me down in calm?
Where the hell do you get off anyway?

Well, there's people out there who tell you lies
They get off on giving wrong direction
Well, fabrication's my best friend
But I ain't never been so insulted in my whole life

Ridin' on the freak train, train, train, train
Well, there's a whole new story there

Let it hang out like you just don't care
And drag it everywhere, woo

One day I'm gonna get me enough gold to get me
Where I wanna go comfortably
They say sellin' [?] is a little faster but uh
But now it's freaks howlin' woo get off me

There's a man with hands for every finger claimin' he's a folk singer
And he's raring to bite his nails
Think I'd rather ride the rails
Ridin' on the freak train

// Blackberry Song //

Man I like your style
Make it last a little while
Put your self under the ground
And you come back around
I wanna see ya
Still the same

Girl your like a child
Your blackberries grow so wild
Pick the best ones off the bush
And relish and wish you were alright
Left
With lace 
With rightness

My beloved blackberry
My love for you floats free
Leave yourself in sound turn around
Sing me your blackberry song

// Monkey //

Oh, my darling
I was born when I met you
If you don't mind now would
I lie could I get you to redesign
And redeliver me again

I'll be your baby
And I'll be your father
Your little brother
Won't be no bother
Just born in autumn
Came and I am here

I see you saw me
In the mirror in half
It's so exciting that we both
Just laugh and laugh

The other night you were away
I missed you so bad
I found me doing something
Desperate, I was so sad
I swear I held my own hand
Pretending it was yours

Oh, my monkey love is funny
When it's so strong
It's so strong and it goes on
For so, so long
And it's long and strong
And funny and it pours
