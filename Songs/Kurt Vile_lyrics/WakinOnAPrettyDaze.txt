// Wakin On A Pretty Day //

Wakin in the dawn of day
I gotta think about what I wanna say
Phone ringin off the shelf
I guess he wanted to kill himself
Wakin on a pretty day
Don't know why I ever go away
It's hard to explain
My love in this daze

You can say I've been most all around
But honey I ain't goin nowhere
Don't worry bout a thing
It's only dying
I love along a straight line
Nothin always comes to mind
To be frank, I'm fried
But I don't mind

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Been diggin
Layin low, low, low
I'm diggin
Layin low, low, low
Dig, dig in
To these lives that we are livin
Livin low
Lackadaisically so

Risin at the crack of dawn
I gotta think about what wisecrack
I'm gonna drop along the way today
Phone ringin off the shelf
I guess somebody got somethin they
Really wanna prove to us today

Wakin on a pretty day
For any place
No use sayin nothin
To explain it
To my loved ones today

// KV Crimes //

i should have known:
my heart has overgrown
"do ya risk it exploding all over?"
well you better get a load o this one
with a load on
the time has come
and i believe i've come too,
for to tell you
but somethin's always in the way

all right, what now?
that's fine, i think i'm ready
to claim what's mine,
rightfully, yeah...

crestfallen
dejected with the
east coast crutch
day dreamin, thru the dark days
club mate, on holiday
with the Moon Duo
(space partners)

all right, what now?
...the time has come
and i think i came too
bleedin, bleedin
ever so slightly, yeah...

i could have called this
saw it a mile away:
"baby, stay."

// Was All Talk //

Spirit in the sky
Transparent to the eye
Talkin' trash on nothin'
The human eye can see anyway
So that's anarchy for you and me
When outta this world is outta mind

There was a time in my life
When they thought I was all talk
Now I'm bein' stalked by God, walkin'
I got the upper hand, walkin'
Now take a look at my hands
Watch em go, watch me go
Yeah I'm goin', yeah I'm gone

Freak in the fog
Through the dew in the dawn
All the words you sang were wrong
Now won't ya watch me?

Left-handed smoke-shiftin'
For my right-hand man
Can you sense the snag in my plan?
Spirit in the ether
For my right-wing sister
Safe to say she don't get out that much

There is a time in my life that is
Gone I sometimes still go back to
Not to be all stalkin' myself too much
When I get the upper hand
Here, in present days
Now take a look at my hands
Watch em go, watch me go
Yeah I'm goin... yeah I'm gone

Freak in the fog
In the sea of the storm
Makin' music is easy:
Watch me

// Girl Called Alex //

In the dawn observing light
I recall a girl named Alex
She and Mark they where happily wed
Hey at least in my head
I think about them all the time
[X4]
I wanna live all the time
In my fantasy infinity
There I will never be abandoned
There I'll ever handle against everything from ever happening to them
And they hate it when I say
I wanna
I wanna walk out into the night
Without it being running away
From a bad day in my brain
For the sake of this drift that I could be cruising
In the comfort of a sportscar illusion
I think about them all the time
[X4]
They hate it when I say

// Never Run Away //

You had it all my day, you had it all
You had it all my day
Each morning we marry,
It's just the most gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away!
You met a young man who was a wild child
who harmonizes keys in his droning mind
Saxophone sings from inside his head cryin'

I know you'll never run away

I'm living all the time, thanks cause your mine
You turn my dying days away
Each day we carry on like believers and lovers
Though there are others who would rather run away

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
If you wanna hear a secret ...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Pay pay pay close attention

I know you'll never run away

Holding you all night through to the dawn
You turn my dying days away
My steady diet of high on love
Then taking dope to cope, had to come down sometime

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey man
Pay pay pay close attention

I know you'll never run away

// Pure Pain //

Well I want to be with you
(when can I?)
I don't know, well I'm workin,
Babe, but I want you, too, there,
But I want to be around
And I want you around, deep down
Imbedded in my brain,
Inbedded in my-wow,
What pure pain

All of the roads that I travel down
Get lost and then found again
All bring me back to my baby
Yeah, that's what you are
Every time that I look out my window
All of my thoughts they go travelin
Out where the coldest of winds blow
Only to drift back to you, girl
Yeah, that's what you are...

And I want to be with you (when can I?)
I don't know, when I'm workin, babe, I want/wish you were here
Cuz I want to be around,
And I want you around
Deep down I'm breakin d-down...
Wow, it's the purest of pure pain

Every time that I look out my window
All my emotions they are spreading
Zip thru winding highways in my head
Pick up momentum then I'm coastin
Only to turn around abrupt
Come back for my love
Yeah, that's what you are
Yeah, that's what you are

// Too Hard //

Take your time,
So they say and that's probably
The best way to be, but what about
Those who are fathers and
What about their daughters?
I will promise to do my very best,
To do my duty,
For God and my country,
Hey but I'm just human after all.
I will promise not to smoke too much and
I will promise not to party
Too hard... too hard... too hard...
(it's too hard)

Did you ever bang on a xylophone
That took you everywhere from home?
Well I did... Well I've tried...
Life is like a ball of beauty that
Makes you wanna just cry, then you die.

I will promise to go outta my way
To do the right thing from now on.
(Believe me, baby.)
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta take hold of the hand
That ain't his but it is.
Take your time, so they say, and that's
Gotta be the best way, but what about
Those who are fathers and
What about the others?
I know that you don't know a stranger
But I'm no stranger than the rest
And I'm no stranger to you.

Take your time they say it's all around
And I think I'd say I know
Just where that I am bound.
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta hold tight
To the heart of the matter at hand.
So take your time, baby girl,
Cause that's, that's the best of all.
(One day you'll believe me, baby...)
I will promise to do my very best
To do my very best for you,
And that won't be
Too hard... too hard... too hard...

// Shame Chamber //

Everyone's sayin' I should probably give up
And hey, I wouldn't wanna waste no time
How can I even look myself in the mirror
Then again, why would I?

It's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can

Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Oh baby when you cry, it brings a tear to my eye
Oh shame on us

Chubby in the face in a world of muck and slime
Time for the comedown
How can I even look myself in the mirror?
Then again I guess I think I

Wouldn't really matter in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can

Yeah, it's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can

Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Oh baby when you cry, it brings a tear to my eye
Oh shame on us

// Snowflakes Are Dancing //

Bought a ticket from a tin man, he was my main man
He told me something, he told me everything
Through my dark day, he led the way
Again I stray away, again I stay

There is but one true love, within my heart
There is but one man, that I am
When I'm away out there, I wanna go home
When I am home, my head stays out there

Snowflakes are dancing, this man is pumping
Headphones are loud, chilling on a pillowy cloud
Comfort of codeine, and Springsteen pristine
You should sing just whatever

ooooooh
oooooooooh-oooooooooooh

// Air Bud //

Strange, strange days is inside
My mind is daily changin'
And it's charged by
The shifting tones of time flyin'
Just in case you were wondering where I
Was...

Strange, strange days inside
My mind... is daily changin'...
As result of the black cloud comin' down
Just in case you were watchin' the
Horizon...

(We want out and we want it now)
(We wanna take it outta town)

// Goldtone //

Sometimes when I get in my zone, you'd think I was stoned
But I never as they say, touched the stuff

I might be adrift, but I'm still alert
Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone
Golden tones

In the night when all hibernates I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark depths of my soul tone
Golden tones

Gold tones

There's a place in my heart for all of my friends
Some have stepped out but some check back in

Been livin' my life on the run, from day one
Every day is "hey, so are they"

But if I been lookin' back today
Lookin' back in gold tones

Yeah, yeah

In the night when all hibernates I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark depths of my soul tone
Golden tones

Yeah, yeah

I been all around, been up and down
This round world that is always turning

Til some day or so they say
When a-hey, hey, I wanna hear a gold tone

Sometimes as I'm floating away I wish I could stay
Then I arrive among the dropping flies

There's in my heart, been trying to locate
It's somewhere within and it's for them that is gold tones

Yeah, yeah

In the night when all hibernates I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark depths of my soul tone
Golden tones

Sometimes when I get in my zone, you'd think I was stoned
But I never as they say, touched the stuff

I might be adrift, but I'm still alert
Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone

Yeah, yeah
