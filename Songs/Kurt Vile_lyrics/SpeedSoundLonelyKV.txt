// Speed Of The Sound Of Loneliness //

You come home late and you come home early
You come home big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home curly
Sometimes you d-don't come home at all

Well what in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well I got a heart that a-burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind?

Well what in the world has come over you?
What in heaven's name have you done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

Well it's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow?
You ain't got no word to say

So what in the world has come over you?
What the hell you th-think you d-done?
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run

You're out there running just to be on the run
You're out there running just to be on the run

Run

// Gone Girl //

She is deliciously tall
Sort of a long girl
She is delightfully small
Sort of a song girl
She freely admits to the world
That she was a wrong girl
That's nothing compared to the fact
That she is a gone girl

Gone like a knock on the door
Gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind forevermore

She never laid claim to the fact
That she was a strong girl
So why should I loudly proclaim
That she was a wrong girl?
I'd rather think of her name
As some sort of song girl
And think poetical things
To think of my gone girl

Gone like a knock on the door
Gone with yesterday and before
Gone with the wind forevermore

// Dandelions //

Dandelions
For my girls

I ain't lyin'
Just bein' a little exotic
You can blow on 'em
Or you can just hold 'em
I ain't mindin'
Even when you're cryin'
Any which way you wanna go with 'em

I like the feeling
Of being sentimental
And also a little mental
I don't mind crying
But I prefer them be tears of joy over rage
Anything over rage
Anything over now
And everything over age
I'm over that
When I look back at my

Dandelions
For my three girls
Dandelions
For my three girls

You can throw 'em
Or you can merely hold 'em
Yeah, you can throw 'em
Or you can plain plum hold 'em

Sure I like tryin'
Comin' up with something a little extracurricular
But a lot of the timings
It's the simple things in life that do
They really do
They can blow on 'em
Yeah, you can blow on 'em
Or you can merely hold 'em

Dandelions
For my three girls
Dandelions
For my three girls

I ain't lyin'
Just bein' a little exotic
You can throw 'em
Or you can just plain plum hold 'em
I ain't lyin'
Just feel I'm coming up on a quick quixotic sentiment
On a slow slow burn burn tune tune
That I wrote for
You and you and you and

Dandelions
For my three girls
Three baby girls

// How Lucky //

Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get

I bronzed my shoes and I hung from the rear-view mirror
Bronzed admiration in a blind spot of regret
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get

Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, scratched my head and lit my cigarette
Well, there was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get

Today I walked down the street I used to wander
Yeah, shook my hand and made myself a bet
There was all these things that I don't think I remember
Hey, how lucky can one man get
Hey, how lucky can one man get
Hey, how lucky can one man get

// Pearls //

Where you been now, little girl?
Where you been now, little girl?
Did you get your purse all filled with pearls?

Where'd you go out all alone?
Where'd you go out all alone?
Why'd you come back looking stoned?

Where you been now, little girl?
Where you been now, little girl?
Roamin' in your own little world?

I see your eyes all filled with sin
I can see you in it up to your chin
Tell me, girl, now where you been?
