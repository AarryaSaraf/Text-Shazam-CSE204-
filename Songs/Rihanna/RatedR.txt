// Mad House //

Ladies and gentleman
To those among you who are easily frightened
We suggest you turn away now
To those of you who think you can take it
We say welcome to the mad house

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh (Mad house)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Come on, come on, come on in
Come on, come on in (Mad house)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh

// Wait Your Turn //

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
Wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
They already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe, you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this (Young!)
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades (Shades)
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop (Hold up)
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)
No fear
And while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)

Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)

Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now
Run through your town, I'll shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million (Young!)
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

So hard, so hard, so hard, so hard (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

Go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to em

Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard (Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

That I, I, I, I'm so hard (Yeah!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Yeah!)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)

// Stupid In Love //

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is "You Idiot" (Such an idiot)
Mm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
'Til I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love

Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

I'm a rock star (rock star)

Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

// Russian Roulette //

Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps."
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Ooh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

// Fire Bomb //

Gunfire left a hole in the tank
Losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail
And he's after me

Hope it don't get here
Before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breathe

You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going I don't need my brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So, I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold but, baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going we don't need no brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb

// Photographs //

Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey

All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart

My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs

// Te Amo //

Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Listen we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I'm moving through the light
Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way

Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
Without asking why
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?

Think it means I love you
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?

// Cold Case Love //

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold-case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love

Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold-case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love
We opened up a cold-case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold-case love
Love

// The Last Song //

Here we are
Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song, but baby we'll hear it when I'm gone

It's time to turn on the last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh

What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again holding hands with my friend again
But then again maybe we gave our all a song we'll never forget
Baby let them play it maybe it'll save the world
They gonna miss hearing it when it's gone

But it's time to turn on the last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh

What if we left every moment that we could spare
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful that's why I started singing it
But this song is our song
So it's playing until the end even if it's the last song

The last song
Ooh
The last song
Ooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
Ooh

// Hole In My Head //

Let go!
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head girl

No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talking about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feeling watered down
You're gonna drown

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
I'mma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feeling watered down
Baby might drown

Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)
Watch me, watch me
(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)

(Uh, uh, break it down) Ooh
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh" (Oh)
Uh, now go "Ooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh"
I hear voices in my head, they go "Ooh" (Oh)
Now go

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl
You got a hole in your head
You got a hole in your head girl (Oh)
