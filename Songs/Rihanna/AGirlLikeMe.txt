// SOS //

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(You know, I've never felt like this before) Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
(This feels, like, so real) Oh, oh

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see, it don't feel right
S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still, I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
Boy, you keep me hanging on, the way you make me feel

S-O-S, please, someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard (Y-O-U are)
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night

This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still, I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone come and rescue me, yeah)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said, boy, I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

S-O-S, please, someone help me (Somebody help me, yeah)
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard (Why you making this hard for me, baby?)
You got me tossing and turning, can't sleep at night (Ooh)

This time, please, someone come and rescue me (Someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me, but still, I'm losing it
This time, please, someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it (All of the time)
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it (Best of me, I'm losing it )

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh

// Kisses Don't Lie //

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lusting, yeah

So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missing
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Whoa)

You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life

So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missing
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (Listen, hey, oh)
And it's tearing me all up inside (Inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me (Crush me, baby)
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in? (Trust in, hey, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Don't lie, baby, kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why (Whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie (Whoa)
Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

So you see, you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between "yes" and "no"

'Cause when you kiss me (Kiss me)
I feel everything that I've been missing (Missing)
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen (Just won't listen, baby, hey)
And it's tearing me all up inside (Whoa, inside)
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in? (Trust in, baby, yeah)
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause, baby, kisses don't lie

Kisses don't, no, they don't, never don't lie (Kisses don't lie)
You can run if you want, but you can't hide (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no, they don't, kisses don't lie

// Unfaithful //

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

A murderer, no, no, no
Yeah, yeah

// We Ride //

Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin' (And my lovin')
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why you said

We ride (Mmm)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride (Yeah)
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)

We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
We used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die

We ride

But then they turn against you when you're not around

// Final Goodbye //

I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Mm

Hold on me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside, the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye

Promise you our love
Will carry on
Until you turn eternal
We belong

Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye

Goodbye

Hey, ay, yeah
Yeah, ay, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy, it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
(What you're giving me boy)
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day (Every day), I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)

Boy, you got me tripping
(Boy, you got me tripping)
I didn't know what I was missing (Know what I was missing)
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understanding

// P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You) //

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, mm

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinking 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
You, yeah, mm

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always something right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you) You, yeah, mm-mm

Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things, a girl can never forget

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, oh
(Still not over you)
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better (Don't get no better)
As each day goes by (As each day goes by)
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose

// A Girl Like Me //

Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Hey, yeah, yeah

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say (Nothing new to say)
Don't they realize
It's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why

When the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to?
Would take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be, with a girl like me (Girl like me)
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh (Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

The possibility
Got me tripping, thinking of what could be
Between you and me (You and me)
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real

'Cause a girl like me (Girl like me), just a little different from all the rest (Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to?)
To take all my dreams and then make them true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be, with a girl like me
Like me
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh (Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror, mirror, on the wall (Yeah, yeah)
Catch me now before I fall (Before I fall)
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

'Cause when the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right
I need someone who'll let me be just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you? (Could it be a boy like you?)
Can give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to?)
Would take all my dreams and then make them true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be, with a girl like me
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh (Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

Mirror, mirror, on the wall (On the wall)
Catch me now before I fall (Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
'Cause a girl like me, just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me (Girl like me), never gonna settle for second best

// A Million Miles Away //

Here we lay, face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto could have been's, that we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

Was it me? Or was it you that broke away?
From what we were
'Cause like the seasons, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ooh-yeah
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Hey, yeah
A million miles away

// Who Ya Gonna Run To? //

Baby, please, you don't have to explain the reasons
This is me, I know your mind can change like the seasons
Go your way, I know the world is calling your name, boy
It's OK, 'cause what we got, it ain't gonna change, boy

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?

You and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying too hard to play cool
I don't mind, I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time, sometimes the heart rearranges

As long as we've been together
You've always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
(Can't find your way back home)
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone (You're all alone)
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)
Who ya gonna run to? (Who ya gonna run to?)

There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do (I do)
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there, right there

When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?

// Coulda Been The One //

Looking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby

My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
Coulda been the one, baby
Coulda been the one

You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone

(Coulda been the one)
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
(Shoulda been the one)
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
(After all is said and done)
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been

// Should I? //

Boy, your standing real close to me
Tell me now, what's it gonna be?
You like what you see but loving don't come easily
Now your whispering in my ear, all the things that I wanna hear
Let me make it very clear, words are not enough for me
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?

Back and forth, baby, round and round
So high that I can't come down
It's too late to turn back now
Still, I'm scared to lose control
Feel the heat burning like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop 'til the night is done
Hold me close, boy, don't let go
Still, I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the morning, my true love is what I wanna see

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Feeling you baby)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now (Ooh, baby)
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? Yeah

I'ma need ya body so mi can't wait no longer
Haffi get ya body, gyal, you mi haffi conquer
So put it up 'cause mi nah guh pet it up
A girl like you does make a man feel like he inna love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dis is not a fantasy, dis is not a dream
Three drink a Guinness and mi deh pon the scene
Gyal, bruk out and wine to the beat
Let me stop put it pon her 'cause she a get it real deep

Did you think you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Feeling you right now)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now (Ooh, baby)
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Can't control what I'm feeling baby)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
