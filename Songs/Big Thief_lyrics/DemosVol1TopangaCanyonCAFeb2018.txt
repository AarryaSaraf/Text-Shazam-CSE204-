// Blue And Red Horses (Topanga Demo) //

Blue and red horses on the run
I think the angel is jumping the gun
Little red lantern watching the sun
Maybe the angel is jumping the gun

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed
Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon
Little red forest in your room
I hope the angel is getting here soon

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

Little red flower on your wrist
Maybe the angel fired and missed
Blue and red horses on the run
I think the angel is jumping the gun

I'm a lot of boy with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?
I'm a lot of with a lot of nerve
Do you want to toy with me?

// Mermaid (Topanga Demo) //

Only a matter of time
Before we lose our minds
Only a matter of days left
Only [?]

You make them feel so small
When youâre holding I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand

Only a matter of aches
Before the body breaks
Only a matter of timing
Only a matter of wasting for me

[?]
When youâre holding I seem to call
Just reaching for her hand

[?]
'Cause just today I smiled
And I saw the number of letters
From the debt collectors I left

[?]
Don't they know that I, I've seen it all
Just reaching for her hand

The mermaids gather around
In the blood of New York Island
It's only matter of timing, before

Before this land and your land, before
Before this land is my land, before
Before this land is her land, you know

That she's gonna gather a song
Give me guilt with nowhere to call
Just reaching for her hand

// Abysskiss (Topanga Demo) //

Try and get some rest
I'll do the rest
Think to what the roses find
With the arms of passion
This is how we fashion
Wars remind
In the hour I loved you
Like a dream it was true
In the base of my pine

Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

In her mother's fortress
She was brushing horses
Manes and tails, flicking flies
Naked as the window
Baby, if it's real so
No need to apologize

Wilderness
Vast abyss
Will we ever kiss?

Love is on her shoulder
Love is on the boulder
In the eyes, in the eyes
Love never leaves
Love is the leaves
In the sky, in the sky

// Over (Topanga Demo) //

On your tongue
You yearn so young
The fragrant night
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright

[?]
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright

What went wrong?
Your words were strong
Oh [?]
It's over but it's alright
It's over but I got you
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright
It's over but it's alright

// Live Young (Topanga Demo) //

[?]
Please turn around
Show me your weary green eyes

Her heart is mangled
She's got me in a fang hold
Please follow me around
Please stay with me awhile

[?] comes to divide the dreamer from the dream
To live young
To survive the one you canât outrun
To live young
