I don't wanna argue 'bout it, baby, I'm good
If she got a band let her in, yeah, she good
I ain't gotta worry 'bout shit, money good

Man, I hate a old big dick-riding ass bitch
Never let a sack chaser hang in my clique
Fuck getting clout, bitch, I'm tryna get rich
Better hide your wallet when I fall in the mix
Can't deny I'm a star, you can tell by my walk
I ain't even gotta fuck him, he just love how I talk
I'm embracing the fake, I'm accepting the hate
If I wasn't number one, they wouldn't come for my place

You ain't bringing nothing to the table but your plate
Bitch, I'm out here ballin' like I'm motherfuckin' fed

Hot girl, hot girl, hot girl
If they say I ainât the baddest then the motherfuckers lied
How you riding on a nigga who be asking for a ride?

Okay, running up them bands, tryna ball 'til I fall
Running from his bitch, he gon' come when I call
If it ainât 'bout money, then you know I ain't involved
Worry 'bout these motherfucking haters, not at all
Nine times out of ten, I'm the realest bitch you know
If you ain't want a pimp, then what you fucking with me for?
If you balling and you know it, then let the money show
If he acting scared to spend it, I'ma show him to the door
Okay, now shake with it, shake-da-shake with it
And if the beat live, you know LilJu made it
And when I pop it, he get stiffer than some fake titties
And don't be worried âbout who Iâm fucking 'cause you canât hit it
Yeah, running up them bands, tryna ball 'til I fall
If I'm with your daddy, then you know we at the mall
If I'm with a nigga, then you know Iâm in them drawers
You let a broke nigga talk you out the jaws
I don't even chase liquor, why would I chase a nigga?
He say I should be nicer, well your dick should be bigger
He said, "You better be good by the way that you bragging?
I hit him back and told him, "Well, that just depend who you asking"
I got an ex who say he gon' leave his new bitch whenever I call him
Got an ex that say that every time he see me it's gon' be problems
Got an ex that's on his homeboy IG tryna stalk me out
Got an ex that miss it so bad, probably praying for me now, ayy
Running up them bands, tryna ball 'til I fall
In the Gucci store, finna tear that bitch down
Money on my phone, yeah, like collect calls (Hello?)
Pussy like a drug, and he having withdrawals
Ayy, money, money, I need more
Get it, get it, watch me go
I be outdoing these bitches, I'm like Michael, they Tito
Not the one to compete with
You don't want it with me, bitch
gÃ¶t2b Glued can't save you
When I come for your hairdo
Got the moves like I'm Rigu
Yellow diamonds, Pikachu
When I switch my hair to blonde
I'm finna turn up like Goku
I go crazy in this bitch
I go crazy in the booth
He go crazy when he see me
And his girl go crazy too
And this pussy so wet, might have to eat it with a spoon
Always in bikini bottoms 'cause I got that goo lagoon
I don't wanna fuck him if he telling me what he do not
I will come over and spin it on your head like bantu knots, ah
Running up them bands, tryna ball 'til I fall
I be off that Henn', so you know I'm off the wall

Hot Girl Meg from the motherfucking South, ah
