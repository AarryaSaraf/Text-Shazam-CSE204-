// Tuned In Freestyle //

This goes out to all y'all tuned in
The hotties, the secret hotties, all you motherfuckers
(What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up")

Talk about something y'all like, stop talkin' 'bout me
Since y'all hate a bitch so much
The way broke bitches comin' for me, know it gotta be free
But I get paid when I show up
Pressed, stressed, obsessed, I got 'em
Everything I do keep another bitch talkin'
Watching my back 'cause these dudes be stalkin'
Watching my plate, got these broke hoes starvin'
Damn, you hoes hate me
Ridin' dick so hard, havin' babies
Y'all bitches so ugh, stop it
Making everything but a deposit, yeah
Killin' bitches, send 'em to the Gulag
Hot girl shit, never let 'em cool off
Make him do what I say, he my voodoo doll
Backshots, balcony, we don't care who saw
One thing about me that you need to know
I ain't nothin' like none of these average hoes
"'Cause I fucking want to," if they ask me, "Why?"
I'm from the Southside, niggas can't make me cry (Ah)
Nigga, this head game lethal
Use my tongue, put thread through a needle
Bitch, I'm a movie, these hoes my sequels
Keep a pussy hoe real tight like a kegal (Yeah)
Self-esteem high, bank account full
Hoes goin' blind tryna look at my jewels
Ass real fat and my pussy get chewed
If I worried 'bout the hate, I'd be a damn fool (Fool)

If I was worried 'bout y'all niggas how y'all be worried about me
I'd be fucked up, too, ayy

Your Instagram account seein' more interactions
Than your bank account seein' any transactions
Love to talk shit, whole time, I'm laughin'
I'll never give a bum bitch satisfaction
Why? I'm way too player
Hoes love sayin' they a demon, I'm a prayer
Drop a lil' verse when they get to actin' up
Put my hand in her face, send her back where she from, uh
Bitch, I'm 'bout my money
Pussy out when I'm feelin' real cunty
He like 'em thick with the accent country
Sell his soul for a sniff of my undies
I'll walk the soul out you like some tennis shoes
I'm finna bust that pussy wide like ten-to-two
I got a nigga, but I find some of you bitches cute
Cut the convo short, fuck an interview
And when I show my wild side, make 'em doo-doo-doo
I got these niggas blushin', lookin' like they Pikachu
I'm the hot girl, feelin' like Charizard
And he know he finna win if he get my card (Ah)

Real motherfuckin' hot girl shit, ah

// Megan Monday Freestyle //

Real motherfuckin' hot girl shit, ah
Still runnin' through the mall with your motherfuckin' daddy
(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)

I'm a hot girl, I don't do titles
If I do date, it'll be Michael
Keep shit spicy (Spicy, spicy)
Yellow bone chick look like Kehlani
Freak in the sheets, freak on the beats
Niggas been hooked since "Big Ole Freak"
I realized that I was the shit when R&B niggas wanna start rap beef
These niggas ain't got no name on 'em
Wish these hoes stop tryna put claim on 'em
He come around me, get game on him
If he on go, then I already came on him
These new hoes sound like my mixtape
Bitches love saying my name like it's clickbait
I don't take shit if it come with conditions
I don't rock shit if it come in his name
I'm not your bed or your couch, so don't sleep on me
Look like a lick, then I'm puttin' the freak on him
All of these niggas is beggin' to hang
'Cause my bitch a Young Thug and I am the Rich Homie
Boy, I ain't finna read all that text
Don't know what it said, but I sent, "That's a bet"
Lately, my patience been gettin' real low
Lately, I feel like I need more respect
It was the money for me, ayy
He gon' go dummy for me, ayy
He ain't that cute, but he could dress
It's the Patek for me, ayy
It was the knees for him, hmm
The way that it squeeze for him, ayy
He done fucked a whole lotta bitches
But it was the me for him, ayy
Y'all wanna take me out so bad, I make all of y'all hoes so mad
Hoes went and bought them big-ass teeth
Even y'all smiles still goin' out sad
Hoes got jokes, but don't ever wanna stand up
Hoes got balls, but you know I got handles
Damn, I must be Olivia Pope 'cause y'all keep puttin' me in all of these scandals
He wanna hit one more time, I ain't Britney
Don't need no closure, my diamonds got clarity
Tellin' his new bitch that he don't do Instagram
Really, he hate when he scroll and see pics of me
Like a new show, all these niggas is into me
Funny how besties turned into my enemies
I must be playin' peekaboo 'cause these hoes really can't see, ah

Real motherfuckin' hot girl shit
Real motherfuckin' Megan Monday shit
The motherfuckin' freestyle queen, the freestyle pro
Young Tina Snow for them hoes that ain't know, ah

// Southside Forever Freestyle //

What Juicy say? He be like, "Shut the fuck up"
Ah
And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it

Please, bitch, do not try to cap on me
Like I ain't the hottest out naturally
I go anywhere in my t-shirt and chain, ho, killin' shit casually
Like I ain't the hardest in Houston
Like bitches ain't hangin' to use me
Like niggas ain't beggin' to do me
From ballers to rappers, they bitches included, huh
Like I ain't the life of the party, hmm
Shit can't get started without me, huh
Like I ain't take over a season
The summer is Megan's, bitches ain't eatin', hmm
I bring the hood out a classy bitch
Out in Calabasas doin' ratchet shit, hmm
Thumbin' through commas, ain't worried 'bout comments, ho
I'm really havin' shit
Invite me, I'm bringin' the ghetto
I be with the ghetto, it's in me, I can't seem to let go
I'm goin' hard in this bitch, goin' hard for them kids
Doin' shit they ain't seen in the ghetto
I'm goin' hard for my mama, she knew I could do it
I pray every day just to prove it
I'm goin' hard for my granny, she want it, she have it
The hood goin' hard for Ms. Paxton, huh
Megan can't do this and that, ha
They hate to see where I'm at, hmm
They wanna put me in beef, shit
Them bitches ain't talkin' to me, huh
Southside shit forever, ho (Hey)
Get a Brisk tea from the Texaco (Huh)
Rockin' booty shorts to the corner store (Baow)
Niggas still trappin' out the Baygo, huh

Haha, like, I can't even take half of you bitches seriously, like
Half of y'all don't know if y'all don't fuck with me or if you wanna fuck me, haha
Fuckin' bitches, ah

Man, I done took off, bitch, I'm outta here
I'm on a ship, outer space, I'm a rocketeer
You ain't in my league, bitch, please, you do not compare
In the rap game, but I'm really playin' Solitaire
Even if we ever had the same dick before
Don't get confused, we are not the same hoe
I don't give a fuck what he did prior to me
Only thing that matter what he did when he knew me, ayy
Look at all this blue cheese (Ah)
Spent that on my jewelry (Hey, yeah)
He know I'm the whole coupe (Hmm, hmm)
She is just a two piece (Ha, ha)
First we were just fuckin'
Now that nigga love me (Ah, ah)
You need him for support
Together, we make money (Ah)
Take the pussy out his mouth then put it back in
'Fore I walk through, niggas know I need the backend
Real hot girl, use the pussy like a weapon
Make him think he finna fuck, then never let him
Iced out, got the whole freezer on my neck
Hoes actin' petty, but I got the new Patek
I ain't say it first, but I'm better than the rest
Hoes throwin' shots, but I stay with the vest
Hoes throwin' shots, but I'm duckin' like The Matrix
I ain't seen a bitch pop shit like me yet
Anything I ever seen you do is on the 'net
Every bar I spit hard so the beat erect
Hoes love to play with me until I let it eject
Stompin' hoes out in some shoes they ain't seen yet
Hoes love to sneak diss, yeah, bitch, I seen it
You ain't say it to me when you see me, you don't mean it, ah

Real fuckin' hot girl shit
You know, Young Tina Snow still goin' hard on a ho
Yeah, ah

// Outta Town Freestyle //

(And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it)

Ayy, I got a nasty lil' fetish, I'm a nasty lil' bitch
I love to shit on these niggas, I love to piss off a bitch
I don't announce my moves, I like to keep shit private
Just know a bitch been workin' when I been too silent
All you hoes can suck my pussy, disrespectfully
How a ho gon' punk me out my spot that can't get next to me?
Your vocab don't go past "Period," ho, don't question me
Any nigga publicly hatin' is makin' less than me, I bet you
They should call me Dr. Miami because I body them
Hoes gotta dick-ride niggas to get co-signs from them
Bitches buy one lil' purse and think we proud of them
The bar gon' stay in Hell 'cause them Twitter comments gon' lie to them
I am not the new her, I am way cooler
Megan is a force so you know I need two pair
Told you I'm Regina, but these bitches ain't gon' Cady me
If she movin' funny, then I get the ho away from me
Head game crazy, yeah, I don't want no babies yet
So every time he bust, I tell him, "Aim at my esophagus"
All these niggas on my body like a Fashion Nova set
Only time they trendin' when they diss me, but I'm on to that
Hoes don't get responses, yellow tape, I'm movin' cautious
All these niggas actin' pussy, probably learned it from they fathers
Fuck your mama too if she birthed a pick-me-ass daughter
I'll go to war, finish it with any bitch who started, yeah

Real hot girl shit, ah
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, mwah

// Megan's Piano //

And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it

Big-ass chain 'round my neck so these niggas know I'm rich
And I don't need shit but the dick
Big-ass stack in this purse so these niggas know I'm workin'
I'm holdin' this Glock in my Birkin
Niggas gotta hold that L tryna come for my pen
I'm really finna make another M
Now, tell me how the fuck I'm in the wrong
If I don't want the nigga and he still ain't fuckin' with the bitch?

I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÃ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit (Ah)

Sorry, hoes hate me 'cause I'm the it girl
I ain't never asked to be the shit, girl
Don't call me "sis", 'cause I'm not your sister
You really need to come and get your mister
Seein' all my opps linked up in a picture
Everybody look busted, injured
Stalkin' my page, bitch probably wanna scissor
All in her mouth like I kissed her

I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÃ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit

Bad bitches run in my pack, gang shit
Cartier frames, spot a bitch on some lame shit
Broke niggas all in my way, clear 'em
Chains ain't makin' no noise? They ain't big enough
Wildin', on a boat on an island
When I throw it back, bet I make him throw the towel in
I got a nigga, but I don't need one
He fuck up, I'ma have my fun

Teacup, I can fit a bitch in my purse
Which one of y'all wanna go first?
Spicy, ain't a bitch out built like me
I run shit, probably how I got a deal with Nike
Beefin'? You just mad we ain't speakin'
And I'm the one that put the roof where you sleepin'
Phoney, I don't need no new homies
I'm the reason all of my opps ain't homeless (Ah)

// Vickeelo And Dino Btw Skit //

How many times have I heard that a nigga a dog
But scared when he play with the kitten?
How many times have I heard that somebody last long?

Perforated from the guts to the door pannels to the booth
We don't ride raincoat
If I got the top up on it, that motherfucker cover with the rain
Double-stitched Daytona carpet, ten coats of clear on that paint
Bitch thicker than Megan, get it?
See, that's how you talk slayer
Have you ever seen a bitch so bad a nigga spend his last on that shit?
Big titties, flat stomachs, fat asses, welcome to the culture, nigga
Slabs, bikes, muscle cars, Bentleys, Benzes
If I'm in it, I own it
Come from nothin', paper plates to paper plates
Mixtapes, fried chicken, double cups, squares, everywhere
"Ke, what you sayin'?"
I say it all to say, how you like me now, nigga?

Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it, still tryna drag me

My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
