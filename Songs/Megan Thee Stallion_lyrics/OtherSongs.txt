// Beautiful Mistakes //

[Adam Levine:]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Making beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from looking soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh eh
Making beautiful mistakes

[Megan Thee Stallion:]
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doing something different, got me looking stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm coming back to you is if you dream it, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doing just fine without ya
Looking fine, sipping wine, dancing on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You running outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressing out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishing I was there (I was there)
Sliding down the shower wall, looking sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

[Adam Levine:]
Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, making beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah
Making beautiful mistakes
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Making beautiful mistakes

// Fire In The Booth, Pt. 1 //

Ay, ay
Okay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Runnin' from his bitch, he gon' come when I call
If it ain't 'bout money, then you know I ain't involved
Worry 'bout these motherfuckin haters, not at all
Nine times outta ten, I'm the realest bitch you know
If you ain't want to pimp, then what you fuckin' with me for?
If you ballin' and you know it, then let the money show
If he actin' scared to spend it, I'ma show him to the door
Okay, now shake with it
Shake the shake with it
And if the beat live, you know Lil Duke made it
And when I pop it he get stiffer than some fake titties
And don't be worried 'bout who I'm fuckin' 'cause you can't hit it

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
If I'm with your daddy, then you know we at the mall
If I'm with a nigga, then you know I'm in them drawers
How you let a broke nigga talk you out the drawers
I don't even chase liquor
Why would I chase a nigga?
He say I should be nicer
Boy, your dick should be bigger
He said, "It better be good
By the way that you're braggin'"
I hit him back and told him, "Well
That just depend who you askin'"
I got a ex that say he gon' leave his new bitch whenever I call him
Got a ex that say that every time he see me it's gon' be problems
Got a ex text on his homeboy IG tryna stalk me now
Got a ex that miss me so much, prolly prayin' for me now

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Hittin' the Gucci store, finna tear that bitch down
Money on my phone, yeah, like collect-calls
Pussy like a drug, he be havin' withdrawals
Money, money, I need more
Get it, get it, watch me go
I be outdoin' these bitches
I'm like Michael, they Tito
Not the one to compete with
You don't want it with me, bitch
Got too big, you can't save you
When I come for you hairdo
Got the moves like I'm Ryu
Yellow diamonds, Pikachu
When I switch my hair to blonde
I'm finna turn up like Goku
I go crazy in this bitch
I go crazy in the booth
He go crazy when he see me
And his girl go crazy too
And this pussy so wet, might have to eat it with a spoon
I was in bikini bottoms 'cause I got that blue lagoon
I don't wanna fuck him if he tellin' me what he do not
I will come over and spin it on your head like bantu knots

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Bitch, I'm off the Hen', so you know I'm off the wall
Bitch, I'm not the one, so watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Hot girl Meg from the motherfuckin' South, ah

Bitch I look gooder than a motherfucka
I be with niggas that's hooder than a motherfucka
We will come right in this bitch and then tear it up
I'm from a city where niggas ain't sharin' nothin'
I had to figure shit out on my own
Momma at work and my daddy ain't home
Don't listen to shit because, bitch, I been grown
I got a temper, so, hoe, watch your tone
He tryna dog me, but I got the bone
Don't got the money? Don't pick up the phone!
He can talk down, he can say what he want
He was just mad he didn't get what he want
Hoes love to try 'cause they think that I won't
Bitch, I will run through your shit like a cone
Bitch, I ain't mad, I get what I want
I'm lookin' for somebody to take it out on
You wanna talk or you wanna get to it?
'Cause when it come down to who 'bout it I'm fluent
Bitch, you was hatin' on me and I knew it
A hoe wanna give me some beef, I chew it
Givin' these rappers the business, I'm suited
These bitches look better to me when they muted
Tellin' these niggas that you got that water
But you ain't gon' tell 'em your shit is polluted, ughh

Riskin' all baby just to be down
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

Don't ask questions if we just sexting
I got situations no conformations
Everybody wants to know who Megan dating
That depends on whatever the day is
I got me a European papi out of Italy
And he like to model but he always likes to picture me
Flying over seas in these just hips be
Send him a pic from the back
Just to give him a tease
I got a man in Texas, that where the best is
Down south hottie and he's cool never stress me
West coast thang, I'm in love with his slang
And he keep it hood when we bang aye

I got a man but I'm fucking around
Cause I'm young and can't be tied down
You got a girl she got nothing on me
Because we young and we do the same thing

You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to get down
You, you, you, you, I know you're so wrong for it
What we've been doing this place seems to ruin
This love thang I'm only half as wrong you
You know that I know you're so wrong for it

What we've been doing this place seems to ruin
This love thang but I'm only half as wrong you
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down
You've got a man, but you fuckin' around
Riskin' it all baby just to be down

I got a man but I'm fucking around
Cause I'm young and can't be tied down

// Get Money Freestyle //

Ay, ay, ay

Bad bitch in the [?]
Trapping like I'm J-Zay
Ye fuck with Trump so I didn't buy the Yeezays
Think I seen Obama hooping in DC in these days
Rapping loops around your favorite rapper like a freeway
Hear a story 'bout me, then they spin it like a DJ
Playing telephone with that "He say" and that "She say"
Why in the hell are they fucking with the Huxtables?
Niggas turn 99, now they wanna say somethin'?
Just another hero turned to a zero
That is why they need to put more women in these lead roles
Let my niggas eat though!
Let the streets eat though!
Fiends rocking around like it's Resident Evil
Real bitch, pre-op, pictures with the peace sign
Low rise jeans barely chained like it's '05
Bachelorette getting that bachelor's degree
I ain't gonna be on my ass if a nigga leave me
I be trying to make A's while my niggas movin' P's
He know I'ma have his back 'cause that's how it's suppose to be
When your niggas ain't got you
Momma didn't watch you
Move with your granny but your granny couldn't stop you
Making all that money, now these bitches wanna top you
Go to sleep, then they pick your pocket, pied the piper
Huh

Ay, hold up, ay

Too hood for the 'burbs, too 'burbs for the hood
But I know anywhere I go I'ma be good
Big bank like I'm Hillary
Prissy bitch, but I still visit penitentiaries
'Cause I got some niggas that'll take care of my enemies
Don't play me like I'm pussy
How I [?] you in this Gucci
Yeah, I'm snooty but I'll lose it
They say Megan too raw and Megan too nasty
'Cause I make 'em eat it on my couch like he castin'
Walk in, make the dick salute like a captain
Walk in, in the-aah!

Kissed him on the cheek in the mall then he cashed out (Mwah)

Prolly 'cause I'm shittin' on them while they got they hands out

His last girl was cool but she ain't doin' it like Thee Stallion
Bitch, I know you can't stand it

Wanna take my style but you just can't grab it
You can't keep up with me, bitch, you know you can't compete

Coming to America, now it's coming to me
I'm not regular, a descendant of kings
Channel my father while I was speaking to you
Vision manifest speak it until it's true
Can't go to sleep, too busy living a dream
Not by myself, too busy building a team
Play with Magic just like my name was Kareem
I'm your majesty, roses under my feet, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my...

Big king, the ruler, smoke for intruder
Palace here in Dallas, the crib like Zamunda
You see we moving, I teach a student
Reach for the peak, elite how we do it for royalty
We teach peace love kindness and loyalty
Roots they run deeper than embroidery
Groomed for greatness accordingly
Legacy the story, we manifest who we wanna be
Obstacles in front of me, jump up and conquer
We the winner not the nominee, I'm not anomaly
Everyone can do it with hard work and honesty
When you reach the top just bring up the company

I'm a king, I'm a king, I'm a king
Where the throne at? Let me take a seat
Give me all that, give me what I need
When I fall back, give it to my seed, yeah

I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Wear a lot of gold, but I get a lot of green
Looking at the board, I'm the most important piece
'Cause you can't win the game if you ain't got me
Girl from the hood, and I want a Hakeem
We can't keep it low 'cause we both high key
Popping in the palace and popping in the streets
And my crown might tilt, but it ain't falling

Look at the gold medals, sit down you should know better
Drive the Rolls Royce through the red rose petals
Run my bath water, run a kingdom, run it smarter
Leave a legacy for my future grand daughters

I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Can't nothing move if they ain't got me
I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Give me what I want, yeah give me everything

I'm a queen, I'm a queen, I'm a queen
Can't nothing move if they ain't got me

Talk to me when you really make it, when you get done with all of that dick suckin'
I run shit, regulate it, niggas and these bitches hatin'
Don't compare me to these other rappers, keep us separated
They be tootin' white, I drink brown, bitch, we segregated
They be chasin' niggas through they city, I be chasin' paper
Yeah, now what you wanna do?
A bitch want beef, I'ma pull up, like, "Moo!"
But I don't wanna fight, we can take it to the booth
'Cause you know I blew a bag on my hair and my shoes
Bitch, you know I treat these niggas like hors d'oeuvres on the table
I take a little bite and I might get me some for later
But I don't get full 'cause there's way too many flavors
But if that shit was banging, I may have to pack a plate up

Ahaha, yeah
Megan The Stallion goin' crazy
Real motherfuckin' hot girl shit
Don't compare- Don't compare her to the other rappers
Don't compare me to these other rappers (You feel me?)

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Picture me rollin', cadillac coastin'
I can finally get my momma all the money I owe her
I been pumping myself up and now they watching me blow up
Used to have a bad temper now I'm trying to control it

Aye, send a text to my ex, told him I wish him the best
And I really mean it, and he ain't work for me but I know somebody gon' love him
But he gon' still give me hug when we see each other
Because I got that sticky, icky, like a sycamore
I hop up out that benz, finna make him sicker more
He ain't gon' get no sleep at night like a party next door
He trying to about less and now he see me more
I got that little shop of horrors, yeah that Seymour
And he ain't get the vision then now he see it more
And any bitch after me is just a decoy
You know you don't want her, you need me boy
And I wrote this on my way to a dick appointment
Ex nigga keep calling, and I keep ignoring
How you mad at me? You the one who cheating on me
And you don't need me, nigga, you need neosporin
I break it down, break it down, like a old man
Talk about me to his kids when he a old man
Like "she the one that got away", like "oh man"
All on me now but he ain't want me back then
I got that Mike Jones, 281-330-8004
He mad at me 'cause I like to play nice to some of these niggas
'Cause that's how you get all the funds from these niggas
Yeah, ahh
Aye, aye, I said you gotta play nice to some of these niggas
'Cause that's how you get all the funds from these niggas
Yeah, ahh

Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars

All the members made three bands, our pack live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit

She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

He'll leave out and come right back
'Cause he know them bitches can't fuck with me (Yeah)
I don't understand how they go to sleep
And then wake up in my bidness (Wake up in my bidness)
I don't know what chain I'm puttin' on
My Cuban link or my tennis (Ah)
I know bitches gotta be losin' money
How they keep watchin' me winnin' (Watchin' me winnin')
Told him, "Boy, since you keep looking at it

Make-make-make a move (Make a move)
Baby, you know what to do (You know what to do, ah)

These bitches biting my swag and I peep it
Hop off my pussy or go 'head and eat it
Cocky as fuck bitch you know I'm conceited

Open her mouth then I pour in a shot
Everywhere I go, I'm making it pop

Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat
I been tryna' be positive mama
They ain't fuckin' with' Jonathan, mama
Who you know put they motherfuckin' self on the map
And now they ain't on nobody shit
I slid one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit
Got pulled over with 55K in my pocket
The police they know I'm legit
The police they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'ma click
These niggas they know I'm a dawg, I ain't worried about him
I know he a bitch
The next nigga that come play with me
I'ma send him to go ask 2Pac for a pic
They say I'm the hottest new nigga
Go check the thermometer, that nigga sick
Nigga must have a fever or somethin'
Heard he was born up on Cleveland or somethin'
Let me give you a history lesson
We moved back to Charlotte, 1999
I ain't sayin that none of that matter
If somebody touch me, then somebody die
Why he talkin' so calm when he say that?
How you make him rewind and replay that?
Who you know get a fade once a week
And they try make it wave, fuck a motherfuckin' wave-cap
Everytime that the DJ play Suge
Niggas throw up they arm like a motherfuckin' racetrack
Everytime that my babygirl see me, she run
And say "Daddy", I love when she say that
Everytime I hit one of my moves, all the bitches go crazy
They like how I do that
I keep one in the head, if I don't let off first
I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah, I'm comin' like Blade in this bitch
Fuck around, and walked down in a trenchcoat
They gon' have to put me with the greats
Wanna fuck with me, she gotta wait
Only yacht, would mean me and the kids
There's four of us, we're on the sea eatin' steak
I ain't goin' ooh-ooh on a bitch
I ain't goin out sad 'bout no hoe, I'm a pimp
He keep bumpin' his motherfuckin' gun
We gon put his ass up like a motherfuckin' blimp
Like to talk on the pillow with' hoes' that's gon' get him
Exposed, he a muhfuckin simp
You know he keep that thang on him baby
Quit askin' him why that boy walk with a limp
I on't care bout this motherfuckin' chain
But I still bust your motherfuckin' brain
Just got head on a motherfucking plane
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth
And then fuckin' yo' hoe from the back
I knew hoe for a day, she won't ghost, she the swoup
And these niggas ain't livin like this, why he talkin' so gangsta?
Your boy, he a fluke
They know Baby gon' blow, he a flute
They know Baby gon' blow, he the bomb
They know Baby was just in Miami
Now he in LA, nigga think he LeBron
They know Baby go baby on baby
But five years ago, niggas say he was John
I touch down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton
While he drive me around, I be blowin' that pressure
I'm chillin' backseat with the iron

// Ya Feel Me //

(Young Tina Snow going hard on a hoe, ah)

Pussy so good got him talking like Yoda
I need a bae with a mouth like a motor
Her pussy nasty she drink too much soda

Walking 'round with all that hate let it go
