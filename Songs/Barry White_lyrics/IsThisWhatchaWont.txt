// Don't Make Me Wait Too Long //

Baby, it's really amazing what I go through without you
You know sometimes I find myself counting
Counting the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the moments

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

Please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

When I'm away from you
Seems like forever, yeah
Girl, if you only knew
What I go through without you

But knowing in a moment I'll
I'll see that face and see your smile (Give it here)
I turn the key (Give it here), open up the door (Give it here)
Girl, there you are, I can't take much more

Darling, please don't make me wait too long
I wanna love you, baby
Can't you see it's only you I want
And you I need

Please don't make me wait too long

// I'm Qualified To Satisfy You //

I know how to love you
I know how to do it to you
I know how to make you feel like you wanna feel
But I can't lose what I used

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Some times you need lovin'
Morning, noon and night
Makes no difference when it is
My darling, it's alright

I'm your man and you know I can
Make you feel the way you want to
Just tell me whatever you need
And that's what I'm gonna do

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

When it comes to lovin' you
No one could love you more
There's no contest, I know I'm the best
âCause you're all I'm livin' for

I'm your man and you know I can
Make you feel the way you want to
Girl, just tell me whatever you need
And that's what I'm gonna do

I'm qualified to satisfy you
In anyway you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Qualified to satisfy you

// Now I'm Gonna Make Love To You //

Get ready
Get ready
Get ready
Get ready

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Remember what I told you?
Now I'm gonna show you
How much I need
This love you're giving me

Forgive me, baby
But ooh, you're such a pretty lady
When I look at you
The things I wanna do

The lights are out, the music low
The time has come, and now you will know
What it is about you
Why I can't live without you
It's so good, you're so fine
Unreal, all mine

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it

Nice and easy does it
Ooh, it's how I love it
This night belongs
To you and me alone

Pay no attention
If I happen to mention
How good it feels
To feel the chills I feel

If you go first, before I do
It won't be long, and I'll be that too
That's the way I feel about you
That's why I can't live without you
It's so good, you're so fine
Unreal, all mine!

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, gonna get it

Sha-la-la-la...

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it
Can't you see that I'm over to
Gonna get it, gonna get it

Now I'm gonna make love to you
Gonna get it, I'm gonna get it

Sha-na-na-na...

Now I'm gonna make love to you
I'm gonna get it, I'm gonna get it...
