// Our Theme (Part I) //

We move, we run into the galaxies of space
We come in search of a dream
What is man without woman
And what is woman without man, nothing

How will I hold you? I wanna love you and say
How will I hold you? I don't even know your name

// I Want You //

I want you
So nice, and you're so right
I want you
So nice, and you're so right
I want you

Don't believe superstition
I only deal with the facts
(I want you)
Determination will keep our situation
So please baby, don't hold back
(I want you)
It's no illusion, love is our solution
Bank your money on that
(I want you)
Just let go, and instantly you'll know
That we just can't lose with that
(You're a part of every feeling in my heart)

I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us, yeah
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us, yeah

Love is what you make it
It's all up to us (I want you)
If I misuse you, I know I'm gonna lose you
There ain't no doubts or buts (I want you)
Satisfaction will always make reaction
Better every time (I want you)
(You're a part of every feeling in my heart)

I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us

I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right

I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us

You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky you, lucky me
Lucky us

You're so nice, and it's so right
Lucky us

Lucky us
I want you
You're so nice, and it's so right...

[Chorus until end]

// This Love //

I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This love will take us
To the top of every mountain, yeah
And find a pathway through the sky
And lead us to the path alone

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This love will open up the door
Straight in to heaven, yeah
And if you want the heaven that we know
The heaven that we'll all get to go

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This loving that we've got
Is something good to sing about
This love and there's no denying
I got a love that's flying high as the sky

And all this loving that we feel
Is something that is really real, it's love
And there's no denying, I feel merry
Good and high as the sky

This love, I'm talking about this love
This love, I'm talking about this love

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This loving that we've got
Is mighty good and nice and hot
This love, yeah and there's no denying
I got a love that is flying high as the sky

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

This love, I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love
I'm talking about this love

// The Better Love Is (The Worse It Is When It's Over) //

The better love is the worst it is when it's over
Baby, don't bother to love me like you do
The better it is the worst it is when it's over
If I had known I'd never would
Never let you love me so good, no, baby

Sometimes I wish I'd have never met you
You're so much better than all the rest
And that's why I know I could never forget you
Where do you go once you know you've had the best

The better love is the worst it is when it's over
Baby, don't bother to love me like you do
Like you do, like you do
The better it is the worst it is when it's over
If I had known I'd never would
I never let you love me so good, no, baby

I love you more than I've loved anyone
Couldn't love you better if I tried
That's why I just can't be with anyone
It makes me feel so empty and sad

Better love is the worst it is when it's over
Baby, don't bother to love me like you do
The better it is the worst it is when it's over
If I had known I'd never would
I'd never let you love me so good

The better love is the worst it is when it's over
Baby, nobody could love me like you do
The better it is the worst it is when it's over

// You //

You, still awake my desire
And you make my love perspire
You, your passion makes me weak
I shiver down to my bare feet

I'm so glad we found each other
I'm so glad that we're together
We got something very special
I will always be so faithful

For you, you're so incomparable
Yeah, you're so sensual
You, so suave and debonair
Ain't no other guy in my eye
Who can compare

You, I'm never gonna leave you
You, I'll never deceive you
You, I never wanna lose you
You, I'll never misuse you

I'm so much in love with you
You're so in love with me
This is the way it will always be
Just you, just me

You make me scream your name
You light fire in my veins
You captivate my mind so
And when you're loving me I swear
I just lose control

I'm so much in love with you
You're so in love with me
This is the way it will always be
Just you, just me

You and me
You, help us, please
Who? You

// We Can't Let Go Of Love //

When we make sweet lovin', baby
You whisper things, that blows my mind
It really makes me feel that we are
In another place and time
No other love I've found
Could make my head go 'round and 'round
Hey baby, hey baby...

When you're huggin', squeezin', teasin'
Chills rushes up and down my spine
It's so wonderful to share
The magic both yours and mine
No other love I've known
Has been this good and felt so strong
Hey baby, hey baby...

No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Look all around us
Love has truly found us
Ooh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day
Yeah...

No other love I've found
Could make my head go 'round and 'round
No baby, hey baby...

No, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Look all around us
I'm so glad love has found us
Ooh no, we can't let go
We can't let go of love
Believe me when I say
I love you more and more each day

// Didn't We Make It Happen Baby //

People in love are very special people to us
And we wanna let you know, that we're just like you
And sometimes, when two people fall in love
It isn't always easy, things don't always go just right
I mean, certain people will try and keep you
From being happy together
Yeah baby, they do more than try
Sometimes they, they really get in the way, but...
But I think, when two people really love each other
And really hold to life together
I think that, that they can endure
And they can overcome anything in the world
It's like a friend of ours once said:
"Life is for the living, and love is for the giving"

Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we

Our love together is so much better
Than they ever said it would
Mhm, we've stayed together through stormy weather
They didn't think we could, no
You fill my heart with love, oh boy
There's so much happiness and joy

Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we
Didn't we make it happen, baby, didn't we

It's really nice to have someone
Who's loving you this way, hey...
If people knew us, really knew us, they'd know
Just how much we believe the things we say
Girl, you're the reason I'm complete
You turned my bitter into sweet

Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby
Didn't we make it happen, baby)

We've got the answer to our life
When things go wrong, we make them right

Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen, baby)
Didn't we make it happen
(Didn't we make it happen)

Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever, ooh
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Just the two of us, together forever and ever and ever and ever
(Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)

Oh, oh! Yeah (Didn't we, didn't we, didn't we)
Oh! (Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby
(Didn't we make it happen)
Didn't we make it happen, baby...

// Our Theme (Part II) //

(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane
Hung up on you, I don't even know your name)

Our theme is trust
(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane)
Our theme is truth
Our theme is honor
Our theme is understanding
Our theme is love, believe it

Something inside me says I'm in love with you
Something inside me knows sure
Something inside me says I'm in love with you
Something inside me knows sure

(Hung up on you, I wanna love you insane
Hung up on you, I don't even know your name)
