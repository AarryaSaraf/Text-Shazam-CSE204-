// Standing In The Shadows Of Love //

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm just waitin' for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
'Cause you've taking away all my reason for living
When you pushed aside all the love I been giving

Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I
Don't you leave me
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
Might come today, might come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
Now don't your conscience kind of bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I done for you
Now hold on a minute

Didn't I treat you right now honey didn't I
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I
So don't you leave me
Standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

I want to run but there's no place to go
'cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
Now don't your conscience kinda, kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry
After all the things I done for you

Didn't I treat you right now baby didn't I
Didn't I do the best for you couldn't I
Didn't I do right by you didn't I
Didn't I screw you right now

Kept you in luxury didn't I
Didn't I do the best for you didn't I
Didn't I treat you right now didn't I
Didn't I do the best for you now didn't I

I'm trying hard not to cry
You know my crying ain't gonna help me now
Without your love the love that I need
It's the beginning of the end for me
So don't you leave me

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

// Bring Back My Yesterday //

Yesterday, I felt so good inside
The joy you gave
The love me made
Fulfilled my life
Today, I'm alone
Without you dear
There's no life here
I can't go on

You're all that I
I'm thinking of
I just can't forget
The way it was
Happy times were yours and mine
Now misery is all I see
Don't let it be
Oh, darling please

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away

I'd give the world
And all I own
For one moment
That we have known
It's strange
How you changed
Yet, I've remained
In love with you
I still feel the same

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away
Yeah

Bring back my yesterday
Bring back the love you took away

// I've Found Someone //

It's not everyday
You can find something in your life
That is worth all the money in this world
Happiness

And for the first time in my life
I find it hard for me to express myself
Or the way I feel
It's plain to see why I wanna scream
Makes me wanna holler
Makes me wanna shout
It makes me wanna sing lyrics of love
And joy and happiness

Never that I'd find someone who'd blow my mind..yea
Like you do
And never that I'd see the day
That it could be so true yea

Yes I found someone..yea
Someone that I can give my love to
And do all the things I've longed to do
Girl I've found out it's you, it's true
It's true..it's you

Never have I known the kinda love you've shown
In my life
An don't believe its something that I've ever felt
Yes I know why
It's all because I...
I've...I've found someone..yea yea yea
Someone that I can reach out and touch

Your smiling face...it means so much
Girl you'll be the one I need
When things go wrong
I'm gonna need your faith
To keep me strong

Oh I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what you do
Gonna take the rest of my life
Take a chance on you

// I've Got So Much To Give //

Don't do that
Baby, please don't do that
What are you cryin' for ?
Is it because you're sad, or mad
Or nothing's gonna go wrong ?

Sometimes we feel inside of us that
That everythin' we have is, only here for today
But every now and then two people get lucky
And find that certain thing that makes them wanna
Just keep it, just keep it that way

I don't want you to feel that
That you have to go through
These changes when
Knowin' no way

I know that, our love is different
Our lives will be different
Trust me baby, trust me

Now, that I'm here, no more tears
Come here, come here
And you won't find, things
That broke your heart
And blew your mind
Not here, no, not here

And my, oh, my
Girl, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you, my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years

To you my dear I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years
And years and years

And I'll fill you in your hopes and dreams
Believe me, girl, you got everything
Right here, right here
No one could offer you more
Than the love I have for you in store
It's here, oh, oh, yeah

And my, oh, my
Honey, can't you see, can't you see that I
I've got so much to give to you my dear
It's gonna take a lifetime, it's gonna take years

To you my dear I've got so much to give
It's gonna take my lifetime
It's gonna take years and years
And years and years

Believe me, baby
We've found that certain thing
That certain feeling
That lets two people
Express themselves, how they feel
Let your love flow inside of you
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, baby

// I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More Baby //

It feels so good
You lying here next to me
Oh, what a groove
You have no idea how it feels
My hands just won't keep still

Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you
I just wanna hold you
Run my fingers through your hair
Ooh
Outta sight
Uh-huh, right there, you like it like that
Closer
Come here, closer, close
