Album: Change

// Change //

Change, it's time for change
Change, nothing stays the same
Change, it's time for change
Change, nothing stays the same

Something new is happening in the 80's
Just for you but you can't get lazy
All you do is just make up your mind
It's time

The key to life is your attitude
Make sure you doing what you wanna do
And watch your goals unfold right before your eyes
Yes, oh, yeah

Education don't forget it
Cause if you do, you will regret it
Technology has gone stone mad
If you missed this that's tough to bear

But it talks no doubt about it
And push it more, nothing without it
Don't let your life just slip away
Oh, you've got to say it

Change
(You can do it, you can do it, you can do it)
Its time for change
(I can do it, I can do it, I can do it)

He can do it, they can do it, I can do it

Determination will keep you strong

Appreciate the life God has given you
You're gonna tind all things come true in time
Make up your mind

// Don't Tell Me About Heartaches //

[Barry:] Who can that be at one o'clock in the morning?
Hey man, come on in, what's happenin'? What's going on?
[Friend:] Hey man, I got to talk to you
[Barry:] Well, what's wrong?
[Friend:] It's my lady, man, she's gone
[Barry:] What?!
[Friend:] Yeah, she left four days ago
[Barry:] Are you serious?
[Friend:] You don't know what it's like, you have no idea what I'm going through
Can't work... all I think about is her, day and night, night and day
I don't know what I'm gonna do
You just don't know. You just don't know what I'm going through
[Barry:] You mean

You try every day
But you can't figure out
Why in the world she went away
She did not say

You miss her every night
When you reach out to touch her
She's not there to hold you tight
It doesn't seem right

Don't tell me about heartaches
I lived with one every day
So, don't tell me about heartaches
I lost someone I loved that way

I've been there. I know how it feels
I think everybody does, who's really been in love with someone

It's hard to sleep
As the night closes in
You realize you're in too deep
And you can't sleep

And you lay there awake
And you visualize her next to you
That's all it takes
And your heart breaks

So, don't tell me about heartaches
I lived with one every day
No, don't tell me about heartaches
I lost someone I loved that way
That way

Let me tell you this: it's not as bad as you think it is
Trust me, everybody goes through this
A misunderstanding, someone says the wrong thing in a passion of anger
It's obvious to me that you, you still love her, man...
And what I suggest you do is find her, and some kind of a way
Make her understand that no matter what problems you have
You can... you can overcome anything if you just communicate and relate to each other
It's love that has put you together

Believe me, man, I'm not an authority on this
But that's how I put my life back together
And I tell you, and give you the same advice I gave myself. Go for it, man
Find her and tell her that you love her and that you need her
Don't let nothing in this world keep you two apart from each other
Sure, you got ups and downs, and you got downs and ups
But don't you even think, my friend, that you're the only one that's going through this
I've been there myself. So...

Don't tell me about heartaches
No no no no, no no
Don't tell me about heartaches
I lost someone I loved that way

Don't tell me...

// Passion //

Make us see, make us free...

Moonlight
Shine down on our hearts
Make us free
Tonight
Let our hearts enjoy ecstasy
It feels so good, that I can't take it
Here's my heart, and please don't break it

Darling
There's a shooting star
Make a wish
For us
To go on and on
Just like this
We are free to start the party
Just come close and feel my body

Passion will come and blow our minds
Music will keep our hearts in time
(Passion)
(Music, will keep our hearts in time)

Heaven
That's not far at all
Wait and see
This night
Just belongs to you
And to me
It feels so good, that I can't take it
Take my heart, but please don't break it
We are free to start the party (yeah)
Just come close and feel my body

Passion will come and blow our minds
Music will keep our hearts in time
Oh yeah

(Passion)
(Passion)

Darling
There's a shooting star
Make a wish
For time
To go on and on
Just like this
It feels so good, that I can't take it
It's my heart, but please don't break it

Passion will come and blow our minds (oh yeah)
Music will keep our hearts in time
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...

(Passion [x6])

That burning up fever
Can't get enough fever

I, I've got that love fever

That Rated-X fever

Your touch of fire starts my flame
Inviting me to your love game
Hot blood is blazing
Intensities are raging

I feel your body heat
That makes me feel so weak
You make me feel so weak
You make by body freak

Can't get enough fever

I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

Said I, I've got that love fever
That hot enough fever
That burning stove fever

In your eyes, it's love I see
Arousing me to my highest degree
Hot fun is waiting
Intensities are raging

You provoke me, my baby
The way you stroke me, oh baby
You make me feel so weak
I feel your body heat
I feel your body heat
That makes my body freak

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

Oh I, I've got that love fever
That burning up fever
I can't get enough fever

Said I...
Fever

Said I, got that love fever
The real fever
Real deal fever

I, I've got that love fever
I mean the real fever
The real deal fever

I, fever, in the morning
Fever, fever, can't keep it
Fever, in the midnight hour
Fever, can't stand that hour...

// I Like You, You Like Me //

It's remarkable, it's incredible, it's unbelieveable, isn't it?
Just a few hours ago, we... we had no idea that we would meet this way
And I'm not gonna waste any time getting to the point
Because I know what you want, and you know what I want
And together we both want the same thing
I like you... and you like me

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Just us two
Alone to find
Dreams can come true

Honesty is the best policy
I just wanna say, that I've got this insane thing for you
A yearning inside of me
Something's burning inside of me

I like you
You like me
Can this be true?
Can you see what I see?

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone and free
To share our fantasies

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone to find
Dreams can come true

I want you
You want me
In our lives
Can you see what I see?

I like you
You like me
What a lovely night
This has turned out to be

Oh-oh-oh
Just us two
Alone to find
Baby, dreams can come true

I like you
You like me

Alone and free
To share all our fantasies

I like you
You like me
Oh, what a lovely night...
This has turned out to be

Just you and me
Girl, we're gonna share all our fantasies
You and me
Forever
Forever, oh

You know, I like you too
