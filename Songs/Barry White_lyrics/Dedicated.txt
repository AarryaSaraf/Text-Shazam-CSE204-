Album: Dedicated

// America //

As we turn the pages of our history, since America began
Many women, boys and girls of all nationalities and walks of life
Have been committed to the freedom of America

"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God
Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all"

America, what are we waiting for?
America...
(America, America)
...what are we created for?

I remember so well:
You said "God shed his grace on thee
And in this land all men shall be free"

When I was a boy - "one nation under God", you taught me
"Liberty and justice, it's for all"
But the writing's on the wall
Justice for some, but not for all

I wanna know, I wanna know
America
We've always done our part (well...) to keep America free
What are we waiting for?
We gave our lives in every war: from the air, on land, and sea
America...
I thought freedom for America meant freedom for me
...what are we created for?
America...
I wanna know
...what are we waiting for?

Every way you turn
People hurt, people say
All across the land
You're gonna know
Hungry and cold people there

But where's all the compensation, we...
We're tied up in all the lies and games
With ourselves [?]
Without twilight it don't mean a thing
And that's a sad damn shame

People got to pay
People got to pay for change

America
What are we waiting for?

"[?] ...47 years ago, our fathers fought for this continent
And new nation could seek in liberty and dedicate it to proposition
That all men are created equal"

America
What are we waiting for?
I wanna know, I wanna know
America
Mhm, yeah yeah
What are we created for?
I wanna know... oooowww

America
Human rights? Huh, for every woman, man, boy, girl
Black or white
America...
America, America
...what are we created for?
I wanna know... aaahh-wwhoo!
Somebody, please!
(America) I wanna know, I wanna know
What are we waiting for?
America...

// Free //

Freedom makes live worth living
And freedom makes live worth giving
To be free, free, to be me

(Free, free, free, free...)
Every living thing, that God made, is free

I'm free
And no matter
That's what it's gonna be
Free
I'm free
And no matter
God made this life for me

Everybody's got the right
To live the way they want to, the way they like
I don't intend to bother you
So don't concern yourself 'bout what I do

Telling you I'm free
(Free, free, free, free...)
I'm free
And no matter
God gave this life to me
I'm free
To win a loot [?]
And no matter
I've got that ride to truth
Yes I do

I'm not always right, sometimes I'm wrong
I know that I'm weak, and I know I'm strong
But God is the power that I've got (oh yeah!)
I don't pretend that I'm something, I know I'm not

That's why I'm telling you I'm free
(Free, free, free, free...)
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free

(Free, free, free...)
I'm free...

I'm free
And no matter
That's what it's gonna be
You're free
To live your life your way
And no matter
What I do, what I think, or say

Free
I'm free
That's what it's gonna be
Ha ha ha, ha!

// Don't Forget... Remember //

A great lady once, once asked us to reach out and touch
Somebody's hand, and make this world a better place, if you can
I know we can... because we, and we alone, possess the power
The power to reach out and touch physically
The power to reach out and touch spiritually
The power to reach out and touch mentally
We need to share, we need to care
(No, no no...)
Remember, this is just a reminder

Don't forget, remember (don't forget)
Everyone's a star (don't forget)
The color of your skin won't change, my friend (don't forget)
Remember who you are

And don't forget, remember (don't forget)
We're gonna reap just what we sow, oh (don't forget)
If we don't plant the seed of love (don't forget)
Can we expect for love to grow?

Yes, I'm White
And I'll do my share
Because I care
To make it right
My skin is red
And vision of peace and harmony
Still echoes in my head

Remember who is watching you
Remember, remember, remember
Be careful what you say and do
Remember who is watching you

Don't forget the hopeless (don't forget)
And don't forget the weak (don't forget)
People suffering everywhere (don't forget)
Living in the cold, cold streets

Don't forget the hungry (don't forget)
A child hungers with pain (don't forget)
If we can't feed the children (don't forget)
Then God made men in vain

Don't forget the ones who love you (don't forget)
Do you know, what I speak of? (don't forget)
It's not just about people giving life, no (don't forget)
It's about giving life and love
Remember

Remember, time is precious (don't forget)
And time won't wait on you (don't forget)
Good things come to those who wait, yeah (don't forget)
But you gotta make them all come true

Na na na, na na...
Oh lord, na na na...

My skin is brown
And there's a few things I'd like to help change
If we get it now
I'll take 10 steps up, not one step back
I live to give, by the way: I'm black

Remember who is watching you
(Remember who is watching you)
Be careful what you say and do
(Be careful what you say and do)

We need to love, we need to care
We need to reach out everywhere
We need to give, we need to share
God made it all for us
And gave it all to us

Don't forget the power (don't forget)
That guides you day by day (don't forget)
Never take life for granted, never (don't forget)
Just live life all the way
Forever

And don't forget, remember (don't forget)
Everyone's a star (don't forget)
But the color of your skin won't change, my friend (don't forget)
Remember who... you are

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Can you remember that?
Remember, don't forget, don't forget
Yeah remember, remember, remember...

// Life //

This song is... dedicated to my seven children
And all the other children of the world
To every little boy, and every little girl

Life has always been a trip
Watch your step - you might slip
Be careful

Life has always been a game
No one knows, what tomorrow will bring
Trust me

Distractions, the world is full of distractions

You want money? Then earn it
You want knowledge? Then learn it

There's nothing and no one
Greater than the God, that is within you
You have the power
Every minute, and every hour
The power... every day of your life

Young man, young woman
God is in your soul
You're the captain of your ship
So be the master of your goal

Life will always be a test
You wanna win? Then give it your best
Yeah... give it all you got

Life will always be unkind
To those, who just keep wasting time...

// Love Song //

Love song, love song
We've tried everything, let's...
What about love, what about love?

The words I have to say
They will be simple, but they're true (yeah)
Until you give your love
There's nothing more than we can do

Love is the [?] goal
And love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more

Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean? (...know, what I mean? oh lord)
Have your eyes really seen? (Have your eves really seen?)
(Do you know, what I mean?)
Do you know, what I mean?
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Have your eyes really seen?)
Have your eyes really seen?
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?

You say it's very hard
To live the life that we once knew (well)
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you

Love is the key we must turn (turn it!)
Truth is the frame we must find (bring it up!)
And freedom's the lesson we must learn

Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know, what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen?
Do you know (do you know, what I mean?) what I mean?
Have your eyes really seen? (Have your eyes really seen?)
Do you know (do you know, what I mean?) what I mean?
Have your eyes (have your eyes really seen?) really seen?
(Do you know, what I mean?)
Gotta give it up!
Do you...
(Have your eyes really seen?)
If you wanted to get it all, you gotta give it up!
Do you know, what I mean?
Gotta give it up!
If you want it, you gotta give it up!
Have your eyes really seen?

I remember Kentucky [?]

Do you know what I mean, what I mean
Have your eyes really seen, really seen
Do you know, what I mean?
Gotta give it up!
If you wanna get away, you gotta give it up!
Have your eyes really seen?
Have your eyes...

// All In The Run Of A Day //

My mother has a lot of favorite songs, that I've written
But you wanna know, between you and me? Heh... I think this is her favorite song
I guess it's her favorite song, because it deals with the things, so many things, that happen to you in a day
Remember that old Washington once said, "what a difference a day makes"?
24 little hours...
My mother has asked me many times during the years, "why don't you record that song"?
And... and it's one of my favorites too
Because it's real, it deals with... truth
Many things, that can change overnight
You can wake up in the morning, everything is wrong
By the time you go to sleep, everything is right
You never know, you never ever know
So this is my mother's song, "All In The Run Of A Day"

A new baby cries
Some poor soul dies
(That's the way life goes)
But that's the way life goes
(Everybody knows it's a)
It's a pleasure and pain
(Ooh...)
[?] broken chains
All in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

You can be down and out
And rise again (rise again)
Wage your dreams
Then cash it in (then cash it in)
We do it all...
We do it all!
In a day

It's a give and take (given, taken)
We hope that we will make it (hope we'll, make it)
But never, never let it go
You know love walks out on you (someone's leaving)
Then you found you someone new (stumble your grieving)
(All..) all in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

We move through life
At such a fast pace (such a fast pace)
Giving old Father Time
An endless chase (endless chase)
We do it all...
We do it all!
In a day

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh...

(All..) all in the run of a day
Yea-ey-ey

Sometimes just take
A little time out and say (we should say)
"Thank you", for Jesus has given me
Another day (for one more day)
He does it all...
He does it all!
In a day, yeah
In a day, yeah

Be down and out
And rise again (ooh)
Wage your dreams
Then cash it in
We do it all
We do it all
(Ah...)

Oh, yeah yeah
Mhm, mhm

// Don't Let 'Em Blow Your Mind //

Beware of their strange, funky games and thangs
Beware of the sly, the slick, and the wicked
Don't let 'em blow your mind

Don't let 'em, don't let 'em, don't let 'em...

They use tricks and games
And funny little things
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Keep your eye on your star
You know who you are
And don't wanna waste your time

They use tricks and schemes
To shatter all your dreams
But don't let 'em blow your mind
You hold the key to unlock your destiny
And you do it all in time

They use tricks and spoons
And little round baloons
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay in to yourself
There's nobody else
On that you can rely

When you touch the Moon
Sing a little tune
For me
You're free
To fly 
High
Ride the wind
To the very end
You'll see
You're free
To fly 
High

Pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Di-ah
Pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Pa-pa-pa-yah
Di-ah

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah

They use tricks and strange
Little, funny money games
But don't let 'em blow your mind
You know you can't be bought
Not a penny for your thoughts
And that's your bottom line

They use tricks and bombs
And little, funny guns
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Just take a little look
Inside a history book
And you won't believe what you'll find

They use tricks, and friends
Will try to do you in
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay cool, be strong
Keep moving right along
And leave the madness behind

When you touch your Moon
Sing a little tune
For me
You're free
To fly 
High
You can ride the wind
To the very end
You'll see
You're free
To fly
High

They use tricks and games
And funny little things
But don't let 'em blow your mind
Stay in to yourself
There's nobody else
On that you can rely

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...

Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah
Don't let 'em blow your mind...
Omu-pa-pa
Omu-pa-pi-ah
Omu-pa-pa, di-ah

// Dreams //

Well, yeah
Well... yeah...

As I walk through the city
Oh, what a shame and a pity
People don't believe in dreams anymore
Unlike they did before

Dreams are made for people who
Who believe that dreams come true
All our fantasies can be
Reality

Dreams are made for us to grow
When you find them, don't let go
On my mind I always dream
I'll find love in you

Oh, I believe in miracles (oh lord)
Like a bird that flies, that files
And I believe, any goal can be achieved
Only if it takes you and I

Living in peace is our power
The light of truth will guide our way, each day
Commitment will survive, any day the music thrives
Only... if we believe in dreams-

-are made for people who
Who believe, that dreams come true
All our fantasies can be
Reality

Dreams were made for those who know
When you find it, don't let go
All my live I always knew
I'll find love in you

Dreams, dreams...
