// As Time Goes By //

Time has always taught us, that most things are...
Are subject to change
But there's something mystical and magical about
Two people, and that thang they call love
No matter what comes and goes, that will always be the same

Mexico! ...ico!

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the fundamental things still apply
As time goes by
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-o-oes by

Moonlight and love songs (love songs) will never be out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate (oh no, no)
A woman needs man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's something (something) no one (no one) can deny (no one can deny!)

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die, oh
But no matter what the future brings
As time goooes by
Ai-ai-ai-ay
Ay-ay-ay, ay
Ay-ay-ay

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Moonlight and love songs, will never be out of date (oh love)
And hearts full of passion (oh yeah, yeah), jealousy and hate (oh yeah, yeah)
A woman needs a man, and a man gotta have his mate
And that's still (still), still (still) to this day

So we must remember this
Love, a kiss is still a kiss
And a sigh is just a sigh, oh
But the world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

As time goes by
As time goes by
As time go-o-o-oes by
And that's forever (forever)
And that's forever (forever)
And that's for... ever
And that's forever, ever
It's still the same old story (still the same old story)
Everybody fights for love and glory (fights for love and glory)
And that's for... ever

...ico! Let's go!

As time goes by...

// For Your Love (I'll Do Most Anything) //

I need to ask you something
I know my timing is probably bad
Baby, I really can't wait any longer, I...
I need to know what would it take
For me to convince you, that I would, heh...
I would love to spend some serious time with you
What would it really take?

Because baby, you are so radiant
Your eyes, your smile
You possess some king of mystical, magical fire
That attacks me, and attracts me to you
And maybe that's why I can't simply say
That I'm willing to do almost anything
Just to spend all of my time with you

I've got to let you know
Just how much you mean to me
Just to have you in my world alone
I'd give everything I own

Life has been a bore
But with you that is no more
You're what I need, oh-oh
With my eyes I can see
You're the only one that I've been waiting for, oh

It's not about the clothes you wear
It's not about the way you style your hair
It's just about the things you do
All I need, is only you

For your love - oh, I would do most anything
Any doggone thing
For your love, and all the joy you bring

Please don't say "no" to me
Come and end this nightmare
Hey there
Only you and you alone
You got to say you'll be there

I know I can make you love me
But you're gonna have to trust me
Say you will, oh
Please hear the words I'm sayin'
You gotta know that I'm not playin'
It's for free

Still, I'm not about just laying with you
With other guys that's all they want to do
You can have it all this time
If you would be only mine

For your love - oh, I would do any, any, anything
Anything, thing, yeah
For your love, and all that precious joy you bring

For your love - oh, I would do, know I would do
I would do any, any, anything
For your love, and all the joy, the sweet joy you bring

...Baby, I'm not talking about no short-term affair
I'm not talking about some "spur of the moment" thing or fling
I'm talking about serious, very serious time together
We can uncover and discover each other
You know, any guy would tell you anything you wanna hear
Just to... be with you
(For your love... and all the joy you bring)
All I'm doing... all I'm doing is expressing to you
The way I really feel
(I would do most any, anything)
For your love, heh... name it
Just name it

// There's A Place (Where Love Never Ends) //

Mmm... hm-hmmm...
You know, a kiss like that could really start something this evening tonight
I want you to go with me
It's your kind of place, it's very romantic
It's our kind of place
You know how you sitting there looking so beautifully, lady
And I, baby I really wanna feel your fire
I wanna see your passion, I... mm
Baby believe me, a kiss like that could really start something
I wanna take you there
I wanna be with you, and only you, there
Baby... trust me

There's a secret place
It's a love's hideaway
And it's not that far from here
Just imagine taking a ride
Streaking across the sky
And playing music as we fly

You would love the place where I go
It's the only place I know
Where we can lose all track of time
Loving each other, over and over again
Giving it all from within
Over and over, and over and over again

There is a place, where love just never ends
Can I show you just how it all begins?
Oh, it's magic, and also free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories

There is a place, where passion love never ends
Let me show you, just how we can begin
Ooh, it's wonderful, and I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it, how far do you want to go?

There's a place like you've got here
A [?], that must fear
And it's not that far away
It's in the other room
And we need to go there soon
'Cause baby, it's the only way to start

Oh, you're gonna love this place
I can see it on your face
And now is a perfect time
For making love, over and over again
Sexual healing within
All that it takes, is for you just to say "let's begin"

There is the place, where love just never ends
Let me hold you, this is how it all begins
We can make magic, and oh so free
Time is precious for it, and endless memories

There is a place, that only lovers share
Can I show you...? Oh, I want to take you there
Oh, it's wonderful, but I really need to know
How far do you wanna take it, how far do you wanna go?

Girl, there is the place... (forever)

Oh, what I would give, just to feel inside of you
Over and over... (over), I wanna get next to you

Baby we must, it's time for us
To do what comes naturally
And I really don't wanna wait any longer
And I don't think that you do either, I...
I get that feeling from just looking at you
Your face is so ready, and you... you're ready, aren't you?
(There is a place...)
Baby you're ready, I can tell you're ready
And I... and I'm ready too, so let me start here
(There is a place...)
Let me undo this, yeah...
(Oh lord, it's so good, it's so good)
I'll be there in a minute, baby, let me...
Let me do this
(Let me hold you)
Now let me do, this...
(There is a place, where love just never ends) Look at you... look at you
