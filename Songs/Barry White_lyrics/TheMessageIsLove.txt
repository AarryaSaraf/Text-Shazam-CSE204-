// It Ain't Love, Babe (Until You Give It) //

Na na na na, na na na na...

It ain't love babe
It ain't life babe
Give me your love babe
Live your life babe

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

"I love you" are three words
Often spoke but seldom heard
Girl you got to show it
You say you think it's love you feel
There's only one way to tell it's real
Girl, you got to know it

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, girl we can do no wrong
Come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

I know it's hip to just hang loose
I've had my share of all that too
Girl I want you
I just want you, to just want me
To share our love endlessly
Girl, don't you?

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, we can do no wrong
So come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Come give me your love babe, come on and give it
Oh, live your life babe, I mean really live it

I know we can get it on
We'll make it right, we can do no wrong
So come with me girl, before our chance is gone

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

'Cause it ain't love babe, not until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

Na, na na, na na, na na...
(It ain't love babe)

It ain't love babe, until you give it
No, it ain't life babe, until you live it
Give me your love babe, come on and give it
Girl, live your life babe, I mean really live it

'Cause it ain't love babe, until you give it
Girl, it ain't life babe, until you live it

Na, na na, na na, na na...
(It ain't love babe)

// Hung Up In Your Love //

The moon was full, the night was strange
I had no idea my life would change
And there you were, right before my eyes
Your beauty had me hypnotized

Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell

You're never bitter girl, youâre always sweet
An exotic, tasty treat
You're erotic, and yet just so discreet
Girl, you give my body so much heat

You fascinate, stimulate and captivate
You keep me wanting more, more
You invite, you excite and then ignite
I never felt this way before

I'm hung up in your love baby
Under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well
Hung up in your love baby
Under your spell, well
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well

Hung up in your love baby
Iâm under your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well
Hung up in your love baby
Caught in your spell
The higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
Oh well

I'm hung up in your love baby
Under your spell, girl
Higher and higher you took me
The deeper I fell
I'm hung up in your love, in your love, baby
Under your spell, girl

// You're The One I Need //

I need love
I need life
I need to know that
That I have someone that I can love
Baby, you're the one
The one I need

Can you make me feel the way I think you can
And girl, can you make me realize how good it is to be a man

Can you take the cold nights and make them seem so warm
Can you unfold mysteries and thrill me with all your charm

You're the one, you're the one I need
You're the one, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need

Is it possible for you to see the mistake I've surely made
Give me an accept for each one so I can make the grade

Girl can you see it's love I need
Can you see these things
And if you could, would you tell me

You're the one, you're the one I need
Girl, you're the on, you're the one I need

You're the one, you're the one I need

// Any Fool Could See (You Were Meant For Me) //

Any fool could see
You were meant for me
I just wanna be
With you, near you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
I love you, I need you

Have you ever stopped to wonder
What life is all about
Just when you think that you're going under
Love has a way to work it out

Girl, before you came
My life was full of pain
Everything was upside down, oh!
But then you, girl you pulled me through
You turned my world all around

Any fool could see
You were meant for me
Girl, I just wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
I love you, I need you

Now when I wake up in the morning
One thing is on my mind
Oh, that one thing is you, girl
I'm so glad I found you just in time

Heaven must surely be really mad at me
But it's gonna be alright, oh!
I just wanna let live on and forget
Give you the rest of my life

Any fool could see
You were meant for me
Girl, I just wanna be
With you, near you
Some fool is gonna try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Na na na na, na na, na na na
Early in the morning, babe

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
And I wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fool may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
I just wanna be
Near you, with you
Some fools may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
And I just want to be
Near you, with you
Some fool may try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

Any fool could see
Girl, you were meant for me
I just wanna be
Near you, and with you
Some fool is gonna try
Steal you girl, but I
Can deal with that guy
'Cause I love you, I need you

// Love Ain't Easy //

How many times baby have you heard people say that nothing good comes easy
Tell me how many times do we sit amongst our friends making up and breaking up
just trying to get their lives together
As simple as the word love is its,
its not easy for two people to feel and touch and hold and need each other,
its how bad we really want it
Whatever the mind can conceive, its possible
Love ain't easy baby, love ain't easy

We're so perfect for each other,
Still you have some doubts
You're holding back your love girl,
Just in case it don't workout

Yeah we know love ain't easy
Something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We wont know until we try

You, you say love is a gamble,
Well nothing guarantee
But if we give our love a chance girl,
Girl I bet we will succeed.

Yeah we know love ain't easy
That something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We just wont know until we try

He's gonna blow for...
Love ain't easy
Love ain't easy
We just wont know until we try
Let him blow some more for...
Love ain't easy
Love ain't easy
We just wont know until we try

Yeah we know love ain't easy
That something no one can deny
But we'll never know if we can make it
We wont longer knock until we try
We just wont know until we try

Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy
It ain't easy...

// I'm On Fire //

It's no surprise, the way I feel
When you look at me I know your love is real
I never thought that I could feel this way

And I'm on fire, baby fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly

You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You took this half a life of mine and made it whole
When we make love I lose control

Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly

I hope that I can make you understand
How very much you mean to me
And the day we met, my life began
Because your love has set me free

Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire

I hope that this will never end
Cause I will never find a love like yours again
And I'll feel this way until the end

Cause baby I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire
And I will love you endlessly
Cause I'm on fire, baby I'm on fire

Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire...fire, fire

// I Found Love //

Since the beginning of time, men have been finding things
Man has found knowledge and wisdom, and man is still trying to find himself
But among those great findings, baby I want you to know that I found something too
Baby, I found love... when I found you

One is a lonely number
Sometimes it's lonely and blue
One really needs, really needs someone
Girl, I found you
I really do believe I found love
Darling I, I found love

Two is a lucky number
But only when it's me and you
Ain't it wonderful, girl, to know
Dreams really do come true
You better believe that I found love
Ooh, yeah yeah

I... I found love

How lucky can two people really be, I mean...
How much of it is luck, and how much... how much is destiny?
It seems to me, girl, like we found the perfect number to make our life complete
Two - that's me, baby, that's you
Two... two

Three is one too many
There's only room for two
You're the one, you're the one for me girl
And I'm sho-nuff the one for you
You better believe that I found love
I swear to God, love fills my heart

Darling I, I do believe that I found love
Girl I swear, I swear, I swear
I do believe that I found love
I... found love
You better believe that I found love
Found love
I... girl I found love
