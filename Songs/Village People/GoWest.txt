// In The Navy //

Where can you find pleasure
Search the world for treasure
Learn science technology
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true
On the land or on the sea
Where can you learn to fly
Play in sports and skin dive
Study oceanography
Sign up for the big band
Or sit in the grandstand
When your team and others meet

In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on now, people, make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come on, protect the mother land
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
In the navy
Come on people, and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy, in the navy (in the navy)

They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit

If you like adventure
Don't you wait to enter
The recruiting office fast
Don't you hesitate
There is no need to wait
They're signing up new seamen fast
Maybe you are too young
To join up today
But don't you worry 'bout a thing
For I'm sure there will be
Always a good navy
Protecting the land and sea

In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on be bold and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come on, protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
In the navy
Come on be bold and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy, in the navy (in the navy)

They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit

Who me?

They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit

But, but, but, I'm afraid of water.
Hey, hey look
Man, I get seasick even watchin' it on the TV!

They want you, they want you in the navy

Oh my goodness.
What am I gonna do in a submarine?

They want you, they want you in the navy

In the navy
Yes, you can sail the seven seas
In the navy
Yes, you can put your mind at ease
In the navy
Come on be bold and make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
Can't you see we need a hand
In the navy
Come protect the motherland
In the navy
Come on and join your fellow man
In the navy
Come on be bold and make a stand

// Get Away Holiday //

Sometimes don't you feel like you just wanna get away?
Sometimes don't you feel like you just want to take a break?
When you've been inside
Nine to five working for your pay
Sometimes don't you wish it was a holiday?

Oh yeah

Sometimes don't you find that your mind never gets to rest?
Talking on the phone all day long
Puts your nerves to test
Sometimes don't you just want to scream?
Grab your coat and leave
Forget all your dreams
This is what you need

You need to get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace where you can have lots of fun
Go someplace where you can lie in the sun
You need to
Get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace you can enjoy the breeze
Go someplace where you can fulfill your needs

Sometimes don't you feel like you want time out for yourself?
Sometimes don't you feel like you need a long quiet drive?
Sometimes just a whiff
Just a sniff of some country air
Can keep someone from
Getting those grey hairs

Oh yeah

Sometimes don't you wish you were sailing along the bay?
Sometimes don't you wish you had your pair of roller skates?
Skating at the rink,
Round the beach, skating at the park
Have yourself some fun
Skating after dark

You need to get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace where you can have lots of fun
Go someplace where you can lie in the sun
You need to
Get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace you can enjoy the breeze
Go someplace where you can fulfill your needs

Get away yeah
Oh yeah
Holiday yeah
Oh yeah

I need to get away, get away
Holiday
Get away, get away
Get away holiday, holiday, got to have a holiday, country ain't
I just need a whiff of country air
Sailing on the bay
Get away
Holiday
In the sun
Having fun yeah

Sometimes don't you feel like you just wanna get away?
Sometimes don't you feel like you just want to take a break?
When you've been inside
Nine to five working for your pay
Sometimes don't you wish it was a holiday

Oh yeah

Sometimes don't you find that your mind never gets to rest?
Talking on the phone all day long
Puts your nerves to test

Sometimes don't you just want to scream
Grab your coat and leave
Forget all your dreams
This is what you need

You need to get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace where you can have lots of fun
Go someplace where you can lie in the sun
You need to
Get away
Get away yeah
Holiday
Holiday
Go someplace you can enjoy the breeze
Go someplace where you can fulfill your needs
