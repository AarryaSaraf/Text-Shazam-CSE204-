// I Ain't Got Nobody //

Cause I ain't got nobody 
Well it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Cause I'm so sad and lonely 
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mamma come take a chance with me 
Cause I ain't so bad 

And I'll sing her sweet love songs 
All of the time 
Hey, she'll only be, 
Only be 
The one and only one for me 

Cause I ain't got nobody 
And it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 

I'm just a gigollo 
And everywhere I go 
People know the part I'm playing 
Pay for ev'ry dance 
Selling each romance 
Oh what they're sayin' 

And there will come a day 
When youth will pass away 
Well well well well well 
What will they say about me 
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigollo 
Life goes on without me 

Cause I ain't got nobody 
And it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Cause I'm so sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mamma 
Come and take a chance with me 
Cause I ain't so bad 

Hey 

And I'll sing her sweet love songs 
All of the time 
Hey 
She'll only be, 
Only be 
Sugar 
Honey 
Darling 
Mamma 

I 
Ain't 
Got 
No 
Body 

Hey 

And it's - uh - nobody (nobody) 
No nobody (nobody) 
No one (no one) 
No no no one (no one) 
Loop de loop (Loop de loop) 
Sugar sugar (sugar sugar) 
Godess godess (godess godess) 
Girly girly (girly girly) 

Nobody (nobody) 
Oh yeah (oh yeah) 
Nobody (nobody) 
No no one (no one) 
[fade out]

// I Won't Take No For An Answer //

When I saw you standing there
You were waving down compare
And I knew I had to get you
How I didn't care
When you caught my eye you lit a fire beneath
And it's burring burning to the ground
Flames surround me they won't let me be
It's too hard for me to forget

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
No

When I looked into your face
And my heart begins to race
And I melt into the man
I'm gone without a trace
When you touch my hand
It's melting through my soul
I'm electrified like the night
Warnings there and maybe
You've been told
I won't give up I'm going to fight

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
You know that I need it
I won't take no for an answer
No

I'm going to get you by my side
That where you wanna be
Your gonna be so satisfied
You'll never get away from me
I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause you've got what I want
Satisfaction guaranteed
Baby come on

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
No

// Medley: San Francisco (You've Got Me) / In Hollywood (Everybody Is A Star) //

Folsom Street, on the way to Polk and Castro
You don't find them finer
Freedom, freedom is in the air, yeah
Searching for what we all treasureÂ : pleasure
Cycles, cycles in the night shining bright
Brightly on nights tell a glory story
Leather, leather, leather, leather baby
Levi's and T's are the best now all right

Dress the way you please and put your mind at ease
It's a city known for its freedom
Cycles shining bright break the silence of the night
Inhibitions, no, you don't need them, no,no,no

San Francisco, San Francisco
City by the Bay yeah
You've got me

San Francisco, San Francisco
take me to the water
You've got me'got me got me, baby

F0lsom Street on the way to
Freedom, freedom, freedom
Cycles, cycles in the night shining bright
Brightly on nights tell a glory story
Disco, disco party baby - music that sets you on fire, higher
Say what's on your mind and spend a little time
Every gesture there has a meaning
Party 'till the night before the morning light
You may feel your whole body screaming

San Francisco
City by the Bay, yeah
Oh you've got me
San Francisco
Take me to the water

Got me, got me, got me baby
Say you got me, love ya love you so, well
Here's what I want you to do, take me
Take me baby, show me the way
Take me... take me
Lead me to the water... well well it's you and me yeah
Show me the way, why don't you show me the way, show me the way, hey
Come on baby, let's get it down, down
Ain't nobody between you and me
Baby baby feel fast and free
Baby baby let's do hot night
Come on baby let's you and me swing
Love the way I please, don't put no chains on me
If you got the time, you could do it,
What I need is love, that's all I'm thinking of
Take me to the Bay, lead me to it, now
San Francisco... oh I love ya yeah...

San Francisco
City by the Bay y'all

// Power Of The Night //

Whoa oh oh yeah
Woo ooh Woo ooh

I'm lost in your spell
You know me too well
I'm under your magic
Just one whiff and I fell
You know my every desire
You are the fuel for my fire
You call the tune and I'm dancing
On your invisible wire

In the dark so tender
You forced me to surrender
The power of the night
So strong
The power of the night
Whoa
You hold me in your prison
Until the sun has risen
The power of the night
So strong
The power of the night

Taking me completely
Taking me down deeply
Taking me to places
I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go
By myself I dever
Do these things I ever
Darkness gives me strength
The power of light

You keep me alive
You help me survive
By daylight I'm nothing
By night life I cry
I count the hours till sunset
I live from midnight till dawn
I come alive in the darkness
I want the night to go on

In the dark so tender
You forced me to surrender
The power of the night
So strong
The power of the night
Oh baby
You hold me in your prison
Until the sun has risen
The power of the night
Oh yeah
The power of the night

Listen
I'm a moonlight dancer
Baby that's the answer
As soon as stars appear they know
I wanna go I wanna go I wanna go
Take me undercover
Darkness to a lover
Got no will to fight
The power of light

Whoa oh oh yeah
Woo ooh Woo ooh yeah

In the dark so tender
You forced me to surrender
The Power of the night
So strong
The Power of the night
Oh baby
You hold me in your prison
Until the sun has risen
The power of the night
Oh yeah oh yeah
The power of the night
Oh baby
You know my every desire
You are the fuel for my fire
You call the tune and I'm dancing all night long
I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go

I'm lost I your spell
You even know me to well
Just on whiff and I fell for you baby
I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go
Baby I'm a moonlight dancer
That's the answer
Soon as stars appear you know
I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go

You keep me alive
You help me survive

Well I just want to say

Lately I'm never down

At home or in the car

You know I need it
Sex over the phone
Come on and give it to me baby
Sex over the phone

When I want to take a ride I don't have to go outside
I don't need to dress if I'm feeling lazy
I can lie there in my bed painting pictures in my head
I just touch my princess and I go crazy

Sex over the phone
In the morning
Sex over the phone
In the afternoon
Sex over the phone
Sometimes late in the evening
Sex over the phone

This is the part I hate
why do they make you wait?
Here's where the fevers rise
Enough to cross my eyes

They can be short or tall

they can be white or black.
I don't care not at all
long as they call me back

Sex over the phone
It's so fulfilling
Sex over the phone
They're always willing
Sex over the phone
Don't break connection baby
Sex over the phone.

It won't cost that much for you to start talking
It's a very small amount on your credit card account
Come on let your fingers do the walking

Sex over the phone
Sex over the phone
Sex over the phone
Sex over the phone
Sex over the phone
They're always willing
Sex over the phone
It's so fulfilling
Sex over the phone
Come on and give it to me baby

If you are feelin' hot and after all who's not?
Right now I've got a cure to help your temperature
All that you need's a dime and just a little time
A pay phone on the street can help you beat the heat

Sex over the pone
You know I like it
