Young man, there's no need to feel down.
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground.
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy.

Young man, there's a place you can go.
I said, young man, when you're short on your dough.
You can stay there, and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything for young men to enjoy,
You can hang out with all the boys...

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal,
You can do whatever you feel...

Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you wanna be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams.
But you got to know this one thing!

No man does it all by himself.
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf,
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A.
I'm sure they can help you today.

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

They have everything for young men to enjoy,
You can hang out with all the boys...

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal,
You can do whatever you feel...

Young man, I was once in your shoes.
I said, I was down and out with the blues.
I felt no man cared if I were alive.
I felt the whole world was so jive...

That's when someone came up to me,
And said, "Young man, take a walk up the street.
There's a place there called the 'Y.M.C.A.'
They can start you back on your way."

It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, young man, there's no need to feel down.
Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground.

Y.M.C.A.
And just go to the Y.M.C.A.

Young man, young man

// Can't Stop The Music //

Everyone you meet, the children in the street
Are swayin' to the rhythm, there's somethin' movin' in them.
There's no place to hide, so, why even try?
Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay.
Music in our walk, music when we talk.
It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic.
Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground?
Music makes the world go around.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,
Tell the wind don't blow, 'cause it's easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up
'cause that's easier to do.

Movin' with the wind since the world began,
The beat is gonna getcha, beat is gonna getcha.
Music for the blues, for your dancin' shoes,
There's music in the way that we kiss, you can't resist.
Movin' through the trees, buzzin' with the bees,
The sound is gettin' louder, sound is gettin' louder.
Music when we play, when we kneel to pray.
There's music in the sound of the wind.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain,
Though you try in vain it's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Change the master plan, take the hope from man
'cause that's easier to do.

On the radio, on every TV show
For each and every reason, each and every season.
Music when we love for the moon above,
Music for the show of life that never ends.
Music on a plane, music on a train,
Sailing on the ocean, music in the motion.
Music in your car, at your local bar.
There's music when you look at a star.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Keep two loves apart, mend a broken heart,
Catch a fallin' star that's much easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Tell the sun don't shine, stop Old Father Time
'cause that's easier to do.

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow,
Tell the wind, don't blow, 'cause it's easier.
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music.
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up
'cause that's easier to do.

// Samantha //

Baby, my will is wearin' thin, the walls are closin' in
I need you baby
My heart's about to break, it's cruel to make me wait
Come to me baby
We're movin' through the night, a symphony of flight
Fly with me baby
You wanna see me cry, oh can't you see me, I
I need you now-ow, I need you now-ow

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Your golden tresses feel like silk on my face
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
We're gonna be just great
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I like that wiggle that you got in your jeans
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
You cast your spell on me

Baby, it's passion by design, with candlelight and wine
I want you baby
It's very clear to me, my love is what you need
Oh yes you do, you know you do-oo-oo

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Come lay beside me by the fireside
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
It's gonna be alright

Everybody, everybody knows that 
You're the hottest thing in town - Samantha
Everybody, everybody knows that 
I am gonna track you down - Samantha

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I want to kiss you like you've never been kissed
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I never felt like this, Oh...

Baby, I need you now-ow-ow
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I'm like a baby in a candy store
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Come in and close the door
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I'll show you my emotion night after night
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
My love won't be denied
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Say yes and follow me to paradise
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha [fade]

// Give Me A Break //

I'm travellin' throu-ough this game called life
It's a tough game to play-ay, sometimes we play too rou-ou-ough
Now that I go-ot the final okay
You're tryin' so har-ard to take it all away

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break

Well I started out my life, tried to find a better way
To live in this wor-orld from day-ay to day
Now people don't you know-ow-ow, don't you know-ow
Folks always sai-aid, you've got to reap just what you sew

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break, give it up
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break, give it up

Come on give me a break, give it up, (won't you give me a brea-eak)
Come on give me a break, give it up, (I deserve a fair sha-a-a-a-ake)
Come on give me a break, (give it up) won't you, give me, give me a brea-eak
Come on give me a brea-ea-eak

I'm a woman - I deserve a fair sha-a-ake
What you don't give, I will take

Oh I tried to find out, what this was all abou-ou-out
Everyone wanted to go their own way
You say I've got the right, no one can stop me now
I'm tryin' so har-ard and now I've learned how

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break

Now I've got what I deserve, I have settled with my goa-oa-oal
Ain't nothin' I nee-eed, deep down in my ...

// Liberation //

Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation, (right now-ow-ow)
Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation

Out of our way because we're ready to fly (liberation)
And for this right we stand here willing to die (liberation)
No we won't let those small minds stand in our way
If there's a price then we are willing to pay

Stand up and sing together all in one voice (liberatio-io-ion)
If you're in love with freedom you have no choice (liberatio-io-ion)
Even a child can see that now is the ti-i-ime
When will you learn my friend that you're satisfie-ie-ie-ied

Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation (right now-ow-ow)
Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation

We'll put an end to all this insanity (liberation)

We can't afford to waste our humanity (liberation)
Yes there are lives that we must stand up and shake
If there are contributions we're gonna make

We surely noticed that we won't be denied (liberatio-io-ion)
We are the winners, losers must step aside (liberatio-io-ion)
We have a job that simply has to get do-o-one
We're getting stronger yet we've only begu-u-u-u-un

Yea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eah (right now, right now, right now....)
Libera-a-a-ation, right now, right now-ow-ow
Yea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eah
Libera-a-a-ation, right now, right now-ow-ow

Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation 
(We need some libera-a-a-ation)
Liberation, liberation, it's time for liberation
Libera-a-a-a-atio-io-io-ion

// The Sound Of The City //

New York is a city of magic, New York is a hip state of mind

New York (New York) - the city of night life
The city of bright lights - we're doin' our part
New York (New York) - the city of fashion
The city of passion - this town has a heart

Listen to the sound of the city, New York is the pulse of the world
New York is the mecca that's Broadway, New York is the style on the girl
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the sound of my town
You can take a ride on the tramway, hold your breath while your comin' down

New York (New York), perpetual motion
From ocean to ocean - there's nothing compares
New York (New York) - the parks and the playgrounds
New York is the sweet sound - of children at play

Listen to the sound of the city, New York after dark is alive
Uptown in the Bronx or in Harlem, New York is a city with pride
Listen to the sound of the city, New York is both future and past
New York is the city of music, New York is the city with class

Listen to the sound of the city, Listen to the sound of the town
New York is the city of cities, New York is still wearing the crown
Listen to the sound of the city, listen to the people I love

// Sophistication //

(Who-who) who do you think you are-are, (who-who) looks like a superstar
I'm not too impressed about what I've seen, you're wastin' your precious time starin' at me
You try to look mysterious but it ain't no big deal
So one more time to tell you that it's got to be real

(Who-who) who drives a foreign car-ar, (who-who) who thinks that he's a star
(Who-who) who takes their game too far, who needs some sophistication

You wear-ear (funny clothes) funny clothes, but that's as far as it goes
Halter neck Gucci, can take your life so far
You're not half the man that you think you are

Tell me (who-who) who has an attitude
Tell me (who-who) who's wearin' lots of jewels
I want to know (who-who) who's sometimes very crude
Who needs some sophistication

Who came into see them when you're not away
Everytime you turn around (what-what-what)
What you think you see-ee (what you think you see)
Ahh, was a Vegas scene, no-oh, it really isn't there
(Who-who) Who's living in the past, I wanna know 
(Who-who), who's moving much too fast, is it you 
(Who-who) who needs to find some class, who needs some sophistication

I'm not hard to please but your act is so unreal
And I hope you don't mind hearin' about how I feel
Take a look in the mirror 'cause the mirror won't conceal
Somethin' ain't ri-ight, you don't want to reveal

Tell me (who-who), who's gonna be your friend
I Wanna know-ow (who-who) when all the good times end
(Who-who) who needs to look okay, who needs some sophistication

Ah tell me, (who-who) who has a lot to learn (is it you), (who-who) as far as I'm concerned
Tell me (who-who) who's gonna end up burned, who needs some sophistication
