// Bad Guy //

[Billie Eilish (Justin Bieber):]
Hmm, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da, hmm
Da-da-da-hmm (Yeah, yeah)
(Oh, ah)

[Billie Eilish:]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

[Justin Bieber:]
Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze (So icy)
I got more ice than, than the snow
That guy, don't act like you don't know
That guy, so critical (Skrrt)
Tattoos on both my sleeves
Yeah, I don't sleep, please don't wake me
Loosen my tie up so I can breathe
It ain't political, oh no (Uh-uh)

[Justin Bieber:]
Yeah, I'm a bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like I'm mad guy
Always got your back guy
Yeah, I'm the real type
Keep you full of thrills type
Show you what it feels like
Got an open invite
I'm the bad guy, woah-ooh

[Billie Eilish:]
Duh

I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Billie Eilish (Justin Bieber):]
(Ah)
(Ah)
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone (So icy)
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne (Let's go)

[Billie Eilish {Justin Bieber}:]
I'm a bad guy {Damn right}
I-I'm a bad guy (Bad guy, {aw, yeah}, bad guy)
I'm a bad

// 6.18.18 //

Our time is up
Your eyes are shut
I won't get to tell you what
I needed you to know
It's dark enough
The moonlight doesn't show
And all my love
Could never bring you home

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

I sat alone
Awaited your reply
Was driven home
When I started to cry
I should've known
I should've said goodbye
I only hoped
I would've had more time

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're always on my mind
And I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more than you could know

We're both too young
To live and die this way
A sunny summer day
With so much left to say
Not 21
The 18th out of pain
The day you couldn't stay
You made me wanna pray
But I think God's fake

There's no more stars to find
And I'm too far behind
And I'd love to let you go
I'd love to let you go
You're all that's on my mind
When I called a thousand times
And I have to let you go
But I love you more and more and more and more and more
More and more, more and more and more than you will ever know
You will never know
You will never know

// Another Stupid Song //

You're saying that you miss me, oh well
Never even got a kiss without a countdown

It's time to face the fact
You treat me like a snack
Only text back when you're hungry
Your love's so insecure
You're never really sure
Boy, you never listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

You're saying that you're sorry, so what?
You ask me what I want, for you to shut up

It's time to come to terms
Put myself first when your bubble burst
Got soap in your eye
I'm telling you it's wrong
To break into my songs
Boy, you got to listen

I'm not gonna write another stupid song about you, baby

So take this as my last reply
And play it when you're lonely
Don't you say I didn't try
To reach your hand to hold me
I just wanna walk the line
Press record and hit rewind
I've made up my mind to erase you
Oh oh
To erase you
Oh oh
To erase you
Oh oh
Oh oh

// Bad //

Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you've seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

// Bad Company //

Three, two, one!

I've got a man that doesn't love me
He's got a girl that doesn't love him
She's got a brother down in county
He's got a tattoo for his cousin

Another picture perfect family
Should've known they'd keep bad company
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't love me

I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)

Mom and dad are getting worried
They've got a man outside the building
He's got a Jag' with tinted windows
He makes a killing for a living

Another picture perfect family
Should've known they'd keep bad company
Another house on fire by Venice beach
She's got a man she doesn't love who doesn't love me

I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)
I don't need to know
Who you can't let go
Cry 'bout so and so
(She's got a man, got a man, got a, got a man)

Three, two, one!

// Bitches Broken Hearts //

You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine (are you?)
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind

You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Everybody knows
You and I are suicide and stolen art (art)
Pretty mama sews
Stitches into all your bitches broken hearts

You can pretend you don't miss me
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there

Somebody new
Is gonna comfort you like you want me to
Somebody new
Is gonna comfort me like you never do

Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "Stay"

// Bored //

The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

I'm home alone, you're God knows where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair

Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

// Call Me Back //

Wait time is the worst
I can hardly sit
No one has the time
Someone's always late
I look for you
And you look for me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you
Tell me, don't tell me
The hard part is damning
There's something that you would not like me to tell you

Wait time is to blame
Mat top frame's a trip
We all have the time
Someone's always fed
I look for you, and you look away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know why
I came down
I hold your phone
Don't wake up
I hear a voice
In the ground

Waking up is so much fun to do
(Tell me, don't tell me, there's something that you would not like me to tell you)
'80 movie make out party, yeah
(Tell me, don't tell me, there's something that you would not like me to tell you)

// Everything I Wanted //

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

// Fingers Crossed //

In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it, on our own

'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't
(They won't, they won't, they won't)

Baby, I'm still alive
But my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay? You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone

'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't
(They won't, they won't, they won't)

The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you

// Limbo //

I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

To make me feel better
And make it alright
To give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days

I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all. No more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

Can't make me feel better
Make it alright
Give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window

Nothing in common
Nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days

If you love me
Let me go
If you love me
Leave limbo

Can't make me feel better
And make it alright
Can't give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days

// Lo Vas A Olvidar //

Dime si me echas de menos aÃºn
Dime si no me perdonas aÃºn

Â¿QuÃ© harÃ¡s con to' este veneno?
Na' bueno

Dime si me echas de menos aÃºn

Lo vas a olvidar
Can you let it go?
Can you let it go?
Lo vas a olvidar
Can you let it go?
Lo vas a olvidar

Can you let it go?
Can you let it go?
Lo vas a olvidar
Can you let it go?

Dime que no te arrepientes aÃºn
Dime si aÃºn queda algo en comÃºn

El tiempo que se pierde no vuelve

Dame un beso y bÃ¡jame de la cruz

Lo vas a olvidar
Can you let it go?

Lo vas a olvidar

El amor no puede medirse en paso firme
Un dia se hundiÃ³ y al otro no puedo partirme

I needed to go cuz I needed to know you don't need me
You reap what you sow, but it seems like you don't even see me

El amor no puede medirse en paso firme
Un dia se hundiÃ³ y al otro no puedo partirme

You say it to me like it's something I have any choice in
If I wasn't important, then why would you waste all your poison?

// Lovely //

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (found)
But you never go away (never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely? All alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello. Welcome home

Whoa, yeah
Yeah, ah
Whoa, whoa
Hello, welcome home

// No Time To Die //

I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe

We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair

Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else

That I'd fallen for a lie?
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

I let it burn
You're no longer my concern
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

No time to die
No time to die

Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

// Ocean Eyes (Astronomyy Edit) //

[Billie Eilish:]
I've been watching you
For some time
Can't stop staring
At those oceans eyes
Burning cities
And napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

[Billie Eilish & Astronomyy:]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Billie Eilish:]
I've been walking through
A world gone blind
Can't stop thinking of your diamond mind
Careful creature
Made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

[Billie Eilish & Astronomyy:]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Billie Eilish:]
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared

When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

// Ocean Eyes (Blackbear Remix) //

[Billie Eilish:]
I've been watching you for some time
Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Blackbear:]
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone
(213) 267-9932 

Girl, you know-ow-ow
I'ma make this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes, tell me you ain't a part of me, no fair

[Billie Eilish & Blackbear:]
No fair

// See Through //

Wait a minute, let me finish
I know you don't care, but can you listen?
I came committed, guess I overdid it
Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck
And now it's missing

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
I guess I'm gonna go
I just never know how you feel
Do you even feel anything?

You said, "Don't treat me badly"
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love is never for me?

So I think I better go
I never really know how to please you
You're looking at me like I'm see-through

// She's Broken //

Another story
Of girl meets boy
And gets destroyed

Another promise
Broken in two
The lucky view
Of fiction

Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy

He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking

Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy

So picture perfect
It can't be real
And all you feel is numb

You see them talking
But hear no sound
To hit the ground and
(Fade)...

He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking

(Don't need it, d-don't need it)...
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it

// Six Feet Under //

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

They're playing our sound
Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

Six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Bloom
Bloom

Again

Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you

// The 30th //

Sometimes, you look the same
Just like you did before the accident
When you're starin' into space
It's hard to believe you don't remember it
Woke up in the ambulance
You pieced it all together on the drive

I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

In a standstill on the 5
Thought it was unusually early traffic
Usually, I don't panic
I just wanted to be on time
When I saw the ambulances on the shoulder
I didn't even think of pullin' over
I pieced it all together late that night

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In a hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so was I

What if it happened to you on a different day?
On a bridge where there wasn't a rail in the way?
Or a neighborhood street where the little kids play?
Or the Angeles Crest in the snow or the rain?
What if you weren't alone? There were kids in the car
What if you were remote? No one knows where you are
If you changed anything, would you not have survived?
You're alive, you're alive, you're alive

And I know you don't remember calling me
But I told you even then you looked so pretty
In your hospital bed, I remember you said
You were scared
And so am I

// The End Of The World //

Breathe the air again, it's a beautiful day
I wish this moment would stay with the Earth
Some primal paradise
But there you go again, saying everything ends
Saying you can't depend on anything, or anyone

If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide
Or run for your life
Or stand here and spend it with me
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

And we would live again
In the simplest of ways
Living day after day
Like some primal animals
We would love again
Under glorious suns
With the freedom that comes with the truth

If the end of the world was near
Where would you choose to be?
If there was five more minutes of air
Would you panic and hide?
Or run for your life?
Or stand here and spend it with me?
If we had five more minutes
Would I, could I, make you happy?

So it finally came to pass
I saw the end of the world
Saw the madness unfold like
Some primal burial
And I looked back upon
Armageddon
And the moment of truth
Between you and me

If we had five more minutes of air to breathe
And we cried all through it
But you spent them with me
On our last few drags of air we agree
I was and you were happy

// The Hill //

Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make all those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient and know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see the strength inside me burning

But where are you, my angel, now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

Walking up the hill tonight
When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make all those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient and know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see the strength inside me burning

But where are you, my angel, now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying

// True Blue //

Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sleepwalk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Made mistakes, made our marks
Now we've gone dark
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue
True blue

I tried
To live in black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like
To mean it when I say I'm over you

// TV //

I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?

All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love

Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade

Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself it's fine, you're just in love

And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I'm the problem

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm the problem

// You Don't Get Me High Anymore //

I don't like staying at home
When the moon is bleeding red
Woke up stoned in the backseat
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
Everybody's on something here
My God send chemical best friend
Skeleton whispering in my ear

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore

Runnin' through emergency rooms
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
Mannequin faking it the best I can
Cadillac, Cadillac red
No hands on the steering wheel
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
UFO obliterate the way I feel

Walk with me to the end
Stare with me into the abyss
Do you feel like letting go?
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Not like before
You don't get me high anymore
Used to take one
Now it's takes four
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
You don't get me high anymore
