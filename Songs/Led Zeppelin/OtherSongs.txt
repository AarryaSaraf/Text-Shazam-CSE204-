// Somethin' Else //

Oh, look over there
Here she comes
Here comes that girl again
One that I know since I don't know when
But she don't notice me, when I pass
She goes with all the guys who are out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking man, she's something else

Hey, look over there
Across the street
There's a car just right for me
Took on a quality of luxury
But right now I can't afford the gas
I guess the cars right out of my class
But that can't stop me from thinking to myself
That cars fine looking man, it something else

Hey, look-a here
Just wait and see
I'm gonna work hard and save my dough
Gonna buy the car
Get me that girl and go riding around
We'll go to the shop a right block down
I'll keep on right on dreaming and thinking to myself
If it all comes true man, wow, that's something else

Look a-here
What's all this
Never thought I'd do this before
But here I am a-knocking on a door
My cars out front
And it's all mine
Just a 41 ford not a 59
I've got that girl and I'm a thinking to myself
She's sure fine looking man, wow, she's something else

// The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair //

Whoa, the girl I love, she got long black wavy hair
I do declare!
The girl I love, yeah, she got long black wavy hair
Ah yeah
Her Mother and her Father, Lordy
They sure don't, sure don't allow me there

Well I, I'm going back to my baby, Lord I
I swear I wouldn't lie, yeah
I never saw that sweet woman yeah in-a
A-five long years gone by, yeah
Well I'm going home, I'm going home
'Cause she's a sweet little darling, ah
I said I been away, ah-far too long
I been away too long

Take it Jimmy!

Well, my baby when
She shakes just like a willow tree
Yes she does
My baby, when she walks, ya know
She shakes like a willow tree, yeah
Ah-that mean, mistreating baby she know she
Harps, harps all over me
Ooh

Yeah!
Alright!
Harps over me
