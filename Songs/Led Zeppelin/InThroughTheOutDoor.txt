Album: InThroughTheOutDoor

// In The Evening //

In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
Because you can only blame yourself

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

Oh it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have

Oh whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
I got to have your love
Just got to

// South Bound Saurez //

Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes, you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh, so good

With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh, so much good

With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

Ooh, now baby, when you move it makes me
Really feel so good, oh, so good
And I'm so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
And I'm good, oh, so good

With a little bit of, oh, concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of, oh, way, I like this
It makes me feel, it makes me feel, baby
I'm back on the ground
Oh, yes, it sure does
It makes me feel back on the ground
Suarez! Suarez!
Baby, baby, you're back on the ground!
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
I'm feeling good child
Down on the ground
Sha la la la

// Fool In The Rain //

Oh, baby

Well. There's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain't the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah, I'm blue

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don't seem to stop when I'm thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don't seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be
I've got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I've got to get it all

Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain 'til I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh, yeah

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found

// Hot Dog //

Oh, hot dog!

Well I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before

She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she never had before

I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days it seems
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word I took it all
Beneath the sign that said "U-Haul"
She left angels hanging round for more

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she never had before

I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!

// Carouselambra //

Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of brightness, no intruder dared upon
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within the wall, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed
But no one seemed to question in anyway

Ah, ah, ah, ah

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
But no one there had heaven within their reach

I said yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow, bow?

Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
They had to stay!

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the beat
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed

// All My Love //

Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely

// I'm Gonna Crawl //

Oh she's my baby
Let me tell you why
Hey, she drives me crazy
She's the apple of my eye

Because she is my girl
And she can never do wrong
If I dream too much at night
Somebody please bring me down

Hey, I love that little lady
I got to be her fool
Ain't no other like my baby
I can break the golden rule

Cause I get down on my knees
Oh, I pray that love won't die
And if I always try to please
I don't know the reason why, yeah

If she would come back, only stay with me
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit of my love, I give to you girl
Every little bit, every little bit
Every little bit, every, every little bit of my love

Hit me!

I don't have to go by plane
I ain't gotta go by car
I don't care just where my darling is
People, I just don't care how far

I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl, now
I don't care if I got to go back home
I don't care what I got to stand again, babe

I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Ah, woo hoo
I don't wanna go, baby

Hey, she give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
She give me good loving
My baby give me good loving

Yes I love her
I guess I love her
Yes I love her
I wanna crawl
