// NEW ORLEANS //

[Matt Champion:]
Perfectly fine, it's fine

[Dom McLennon:]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, whattcha livin' for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? Whatcha quittin' for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga brother, who you schemin' with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brotha nigga with the brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me decapitate everything for what it's worth
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going with maniac since my birth
See the kid that says, "I'm playing and I'm commanding with my nerves"

[Kevin Abstract:]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions

[bearface:]
Tryna treat men like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains to ya' neck green, bye

[Matt Champion:]
Nothin' different now, all around now
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit up on your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the eagle now, what that make of me?
Angle wide screen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
You know little sinners like they like the Macarena
Lose time, penne style spiced up, jalapeÃ±o
Super sonic move through tunnel, two-wheel cycles, slight savage
Got better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this protein on my body made my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Joba:]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind
throwin' up, have my wings clipped
I don't need them shits, learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear I've never been up top
But I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Kevin Abstract:]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions

[Jaden Smith:]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothin'
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumpin'
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop trippin' out
I'll build a different houses for different functions

[Merlyn Wood:]
HOO! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-Colonized Christian
Now I'm losing my religion, yeah
God damn, so narcissistic in this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like a date
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is an hour, I'm an hour late

// THUG LIFE //

I gotta get that back
It's a thug life, it's a thug life
I gotta get that back (sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
It's a thug life (la-da-da-da)
It's a thug life (it's a, oh-uh-oh)
Ooh-ah (Sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)
La-da-da-da (It's aâ oh-uh-oh)
Ooh-ah

Tried to treat a man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains turn your neck green, bye

It's different like the silent of skeletons
I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglected, times when I obsessed
I'm ready to confess, this fate is hard until I address
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with the familiar embrace
But I know that it will kill me if I give in to my brain
I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine

Should of been out of sight
La-da-da-da
It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Should of been out of sight
La-da-da-da
It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Should of been out of sight

// BERLIN //

She said baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch full of diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapons, look down, let's make these boys extinct
Nah nah nah

Traded that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
Revolution still, ain't sell my evolution, what you choosin'?

No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leaves under the seat (woo!)
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics need another dimension I can enjoy

She said baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wrist watch full of diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapons, look down, let's make these boys extinct
Nah, nah, nah...
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wrist watch full of diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapons, look down, let's make these boys extinct
La la la...

Reporting for the operation, I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my deed itself for decoration
Said baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over the nation
Avoiding social litigation when the admiration turns into aberration
Y'all can find another station, otherwise stay tuned
Evolution coming soon, rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Tell my baby, I'll be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010 I had some old friends, that thought I'd be another...
Go fucking figure

If I pull up out the tool
Riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do (check this, hot looking babes)
Bitch and that's the fucking move
(I feel you)

She said baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch full of diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapons, look down, let's make these boys extinct
La la la...
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?

La la la...

Good riddance, goodbye, out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time, this time I get what's mine
Where the hell is your back bone, ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show, a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault, I just supplied the rope
Most thoughts, I don't think twice, make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama, but I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars
(Do you feel good about me?)

// SOMETHING ABOUT HIM //

Something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy
Thereâs something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know he got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I really like how you do all the things that you do
I really like how you say all the things that you say
I really like how you do all the things you could do
I really like all the things that you really could say, aye
I really like how you move when you're out by yourself
I really like how your crew and you can take âem to hell
Boy, don't you know I fucking got you? Right, right

There's something about him
His car ain't nice and flashy
There's something about him
Yeah, his attitude is like magic (yeah, yeah)
There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I love him
I love him
Something about him

// WHERE THE CASH AT //

(There's not a soul in here...)

Pull up to your house and dump like a trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat-trick, just show me where the cash at
That's you in the hotshots
fuck that, show me where the cash at

I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
Come out of that debt, we'll come out of Benjis
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying to bless a seizure, but pull it like Ke$ha
Jonny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that

At night I bring them out
I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip
Hoping this outflow my scales
Pull that out whenever I bliss
Fifty mil, put it under my wheel
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see the run
They feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human out the tour
Think we big sized to the gas
Miss the days I can't get back

Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Move to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat
[?], where you niggas at?
Where the cash at? Used to ask that
Where the cash at? Used to ask that

// WEIGHT //

They split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I've been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Leave my niggas y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout
When Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about a story they done spun
And I ain't done
And I ain't done, ya heard me?

I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shorty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout a dog and study hall
And she was mad cause I never wanna show her off
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I live my life on standby
I can leave you alone

'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls, force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said, "Don't let up soon'll start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Condition to 'em let the mental our foundation will shake
There's no debate the road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize them wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you've gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain (Pressure)

They tried to take the bike
And they took my friend's bike
And then friend was gonna get it back
But then he didn't get it back
And then we had to go to the police station
And then um then some (Pressure)
A random stranger brought back his bike
We just you know, and we didn't tell our mom
So we got in trouble (Pressure makes me)
Because they found out like a day later
Do you want to start the game again?

Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes, Pressure makes, Pressu-
Wish I could, Wish I could, Wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, Makes me wish, Makes me-
Pressure makes, Pressure makes, Pressu-
Wish I could, Wish I could, Wish I-
I can't take, I can't take, I can't-
Makes me wish, Makes me wish, Makes me-
Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sippin' on my pain, smokin' on my pain
Ingesting my pain, I just wanna play
Sippin on my, (sipping on my), smokin' on my (smokin' on my)
Ingestin' my (ingestin' my), I just wanna (I just wanna)
Sippin on my, (sipping on my), smokin' on my (smokin' on my)
Ingestin' my (ingestin' my), I just wanna (I just wanna)

// DISTRICT //

I'm Sammy-jo, and my favorite colors are black and red

Let me find my way out of this bitch
Find myself high in the distance
Find me up, lying in this ditch
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
If I can't find time to get my heart out
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world out
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound
Ain't no telling, no telling so call the coroner
Let me find my way out of this bitch
Find myself high in the distance
Find me up, lying in this ditch
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
If I can't find time to get my heart out
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world out
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound
Ain't no telling, no telling so call the coroner

Aye, I'ma just bounce with that
In fact I bought a whole damn house with that
Aye, hand me where the ounces at
Tell me where the damn these ounces at
Aye, tell me where the ounces at, tell me where the ounces, ounces at
Aye, tell me where the ounces at, tell me where the ounces, ounces at

It's getting hot, you best just
(Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)
The effects can't touch this
(Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)
Stepped up, step down, bitch
(Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)
Wait, wait, wait

I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I
I ain't ever been the one that's scared of you
Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I
Baby, when the karma gets you
Maybe you can run away with us

In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along
Damn I fall, move too fast, life is skidding to a halt
Got back on the road, and made it to the start
Disregard me, emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission, put it to my heart
I ain't playing games, but you can play a part
Standing up apart behind my battle scars

Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big ass house and big ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want white knights like five lights for some little chromes
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut when they know the place
But you don't know me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper sight
Gnawing on my wood like a termite, entering my world like a parasite (parasite, parasite)

Praise God, hallelujah! I'm still depressed
At war with my conscience, paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah! I'm still depressed
At war with my conscience, paranoid, I can't

Let me find my way out of this bitch
I'm Sammy-jo, and my favorite colors are black and red
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'
If I can't find time to get my heart out
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the word down
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound
Ain't no telling, no telling so call the coroner

Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
Light it up better dodge the cops
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks I- I-
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you
That's all I got for you
Miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
That's all I got for you
Sittin' on your porch, across parking lots
That's all I got for you
And I'll never get sick of playing with your locks
I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-
That's all I got for you

// LOOPHOLE //

Amazing how back then fame was more important than business, like-

Yeah, you know, that's what I was explaining to someone
I said I didn't mind getting jerked, because I was like, I just want my record on the radio, I just wanna shoot videos

And get it poppin'

I just wanna get poppin', look I don't care, take my publisher, I don't know what that is anyway
You know what I'm saying?
Like just take my shit so I can have a video and songs on the radio, I'll figure it out later

That's crazy man

And then the next album, I'll start and I'm like damn these checks saying like the checks I'm used to niggas seeing
I might be unable to get 4 or 5 cars or jewellery or things I wanted to get, so I'm like let me figure what's the loophole in this shit. Why I'm not winning

But isn't it crazy that it makes you question what kinda friends you had back then, because they weren't telling you how how the business was running and they were just-

See that goes to show, maybe they wasn't never really my friends

// TAPE //

[Kevin Abstract:]
I could barely rap, I could barely dance
I could barely laugh, I could barely hang
And there's a male stripper doing a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend still the same
And I'm drunk as fuck, nigga sucks up
For a reason to get my bucks up
And the reason I care about society
Is a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, see my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
And I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit just to fucking ruined it, I'm truant
But truthfully, the words had damage and it's fooling me
But even more cruel to be
This is here for you niggas that paid to hear me

Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off
And I should probably spend my time
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one song
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace
They want my niggas to burn with us

[Joba:]
Flicking on the face of my wrist watch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lyin', don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with
Tragedy after tragedy, God, send a message
Send a messenger my way, never claimed to be a saint
Forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't break at the speed of light

[Matt Champion:]
I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, "You lucky where you at"
"You cool but quit complaining 'bout all that"
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For myself, for the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at?
Four-cylinder go round, Lincoln Towncar pick me up
Drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, meet me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now
Wondering who is me now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account with less fees now, make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now

[Dom McLennon:]
It's crazy how things that are best
Reminisce when we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left
Started feeling left out when we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside
Emotions bleed, I can't believe
How I'm sleeping through the night

// J'OUVERT //

[Music video intro:] (Me llamo Roberto, y estos son los sueÃ±os que no olvidados)

(Take it all or leave it)
(I feel you)

When there's a rough patch, don't eyefuck the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
It's a treat and it's on me, she hit the powder room
I pull her back and check my rosie yeah, I'm 'bouta bloom
This some ninety raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lights switch
Combat how you feel, strobe light, hit the kill switch
Neck twist like exorcist, I'ma see you 'round
'Cause tonight's the night I'm losin' all I'm doin', I'm about this

White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
Suitcase
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank

'Til the casket drops, I will play God
Fuck the world, let's start a riot
Got too much too quick
God damn, I'm feeling sick, bitch, call the doctor
Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view on that petty shit
Prayin' for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of that fuck shit need to get away
Still I get to pray to the fickle-minded people
I thought I knew better, wish I knew better
Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers
Guess I'm too real

Excuse we, let me pass, let me see your ass
We ain't playin' nice, little guy
Now let me, let me run my...

I be in my bag (excuse we)
Goin' in (let me pass)
Trust, you isn't built for this, man
Me and my thugs built for this, man
We're goin' for the gifts and the grams
I be in my bag (excuse we)
Goin' in (let me pass)
Smokin' on drips and dissin' bags
Man you isn't built for this, man
Run it like the gingerbread man

Fuck that shit, stay hydrated nigga
I'ma lit that bitch, go home, kiss my momma
Wassup?
Wassup?

Black power fist hangin' with my black 'fro
Yo, she saw me in that cereal she wants to lick a Oreo
Damn, break the dam when I spit the flow
I'm on the Lamb like the fuckin' wolf
Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road
Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man that's difficult
I just wanna smoke a Backwoods by my lovely self
Chill, watch numbers go up, book off the shelf
I found myself and put my face on a missing shirt
I dropped out with no promise that this shit would
(That this shit would work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work)
(Work, work, work, work, work, work, work)

With the dogs, zoom around, all the doors, suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie
With the dogs, zoom around, all the doors, suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie

Pull up with the racks to your shop
Cop a medallion, a 3 on a don
Zim-zim-zim, out the Bim, get shot
One mill, two mill, three, that's a lot
Damn

White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
Suitcase
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank
On my way to the bank

// HONEY //

My arms are always open
Your fears always rollin'
And they deep and you can't control it
What you want, what you want, emotion?
My arms are always open
Your fears always rollin'
And they deep and you can't control it
What you want, what you want, emotion?

I need a step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit-list my nigga
A million reasons to get rich my nigga
Fifty did it right

I could've been homeless
I thought I moved too often this for the Summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had to go, I had a course

A million reasons to get rich my nigga
A million reasons to get rich my nigga
A million reasons to get rich my nigga

My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never lean to the left or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel the empathy, we made the space too many times
Every summer in this city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you got to get yours, and I got to get mine
One time for the paragon to the paradigm
When you underground nigga only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
They couldn't match my alien, I'm blowing like uranium

One time for the
One time
One time (nigga)
One time (nigga)
One time (nigga)
One t

A million reasons to get rich my nigga
Fifty did it right, Fifty did it right
Wish I could call every successful rapper for advice
How the fuck do I make this shit last my whole life?
Do y'all want to come to the concert tonight?

Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that

On my jewelry, and on my niggas
On my jewelry, and on my niggas
You know I got
Just give me what I need

// VIVID //

Yo, get..
Turn that shit over boy

Â¿CÃ³mo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell
Numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like oh well
What that smell like, oh, Chanel, way too deep like depths in hell
Need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh don't forget me

Radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
Every little moment I step in, might shift a planets direction
Glitch in the system is present, you might wanna check that connection
I don't give a fuck about freshmens, I don't give a fuck about veterans
If your perception ain't ascending, it's the reason for extinction
All my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden and they don't stop at them accessories
So please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't wanna be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, they disrespect, they're too blatant
We play this spot from the basement, so tell me who you again?
Oh you, who's issue was that? But now you watched and you hating
You taking shots at revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit that button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved the path we didn't want to get demolished with aging

We get money get dough, dame mÃ¡s mi princesa says so
Even though my teeth not gold, baby girl know our pockets drip folds
We get money get dough, dame mÃ¡s mi princesa says so
Even though my teeth not gold, baby girl know our pockets drip folds

Money on my.. Money on my..
Niggas that I.. Niggas that I..
We said what's up.. We said what's up..
Message that I.. Message that I..
Call her brother.. Call her brother..
Niggas lookin'.. Niggas lookin'..
Let my niggas.. Let my niggas..
Niggas with that.. Niggas with that..

[Matt Champion:]
Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you foolin'? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?

[Kevin Abstract:]
Say we should just, say we should just, pray to work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah
Say we should just, say we should just, pray to work again
Puttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back, yeah

[bearface:]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Dom McLennon:]
I said, I said
Who that, who that, who that, who that
Looking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

[bearface:]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Joba:]
Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what you say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
I should have made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's not healthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing

[London Community Gospel Choir:]
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more

// TONYA //

[Bearface:]
Mother, I am sorry, I never pick up
Because I'm afraid to disappoint
Ooh, ooh I, I'm not

[Jazmine Sullivan:]
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Bearface:]
Oh we're sat outside on the hardwood floor with our feet in dirt
And our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circle in our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, sorry I don't call
There's no money on my mind
But my money on my mind was the first to fall
Never wanted to... yeah

[Jazmine Sullivan, serpentwithfeet & Ryan Beatty:]
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Kevin Abstract:]
Sometimes it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, I'll try vacationin'
I'll try to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame anyday
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'd switch my place if that's good for you
Is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt you
My life is "I, Tonya"
Big eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause this stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, the first flight I'm jumpin'

[Joba:]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want a war with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want a war with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Dom McLennon:]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My mom will always have these dreams that keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away
And make use of the time I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch, now stop revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the life I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm and my friendships and family

[Merlyn Wood:]
What's costin' your time, what's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "study harder, get that cash"
Mommy said "your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just want a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I still fly coach
And I still hit the roads
And I still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your drinks 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

[Jazmine Sullivan & Ryan Beatty (serpentwithfeet) {Matt Champion}:]
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to (how I used to)
{I don't matter!}
And I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to (how I used to, how)
{I don't matter!}

[serpentwithfeet:]
How I, how I, how I, how I
How I used to, how I used to
How I used to

Take it all or leave it

I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts, your motives, and all your reasons
Two albums every season
What the hell do ya'll believe in?
Why the hell do ya'll keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see them
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cus these new niggas are changing
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me when it comes down to controversy?
What about three CDs in one year with no label
And we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was a nigga in a room with no motherfuckin' cable
And no table
Now my mom call me whenever she needs her car, no, cellphone, whatever bill paid too
Y'all niggas lose
You understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell out, let me do it
Get the hell out, let me do it

I don't speak like I used to
I'm thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invented's what I'm true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see you blow your mind, they'll just abuse you
I started feelin' restless nights, I'm scared that I'm delusional
I'm scared that I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas would consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

You don't understand why I can't get out up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get out up and shout

Stay off
Keep off
Get out
Hey boy
Stay off
Get buff
Get out
The monsters swarm around with them toys
The monsters swarm around with them toys

Keep off
Stay off
Keep off
Get out
Hey boy
Stay off
Get buff
Get out
The monsters swarm around with them toys
The monsters swarm around with them toys

Don't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you got a lifeline
Throw it, throw it
Don't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)
But if you got a lifeline
Throw it, throw it

Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people
I don't know these people
I don't know you either no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother sending bullets for my head
And they foolin' me nah but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah-ah

You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' you
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
[?] got to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel you
