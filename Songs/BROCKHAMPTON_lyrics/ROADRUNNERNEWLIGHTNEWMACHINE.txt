// BUZZCUT //

Who let the dope boys out?
Thank God you let me crash on your couch
Who's my God that I'm prayin' to now?
Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
A Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
A platinum record not gon' keep my black ass out of jail
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali' just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
Web of life is my weed, false dreams stripped by silence
Deals they had us sign, for years it had me blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine
Got my cousin doin' time, he was barely pushin' dimes
My whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
So get the fuck out my ride
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, I (Get the fuck out)
Fuck with me, give no shit, guess my ignorance is bliss
Now get the fuck out my ride
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
So get the fuck out my ride
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, I
If a killer say shit, then get these motherfuckersâ (Get the fuck out)

Live from the gutter, blood like red paint spills
You niggas ain't alpha, you're incels
You normies ain't a part of the script, dox your house with crips
Pop shit and I'ma get content, a constant
Where to begin? A veteran with medicine pen
Let 'em all in, treat 'em like they next of my kin
Checkin' your chin way before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend, tell you how it is, how it go
What do you know, when you start escapin' your soul
White on the street, walking the beat like Abbey Road
Truth be told, no such thing as real nigga mold
Through the light, camera, action, glamour, glitters and gold
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat
Gotta watch for these savages roamin' the street (Go)

I, I, I, I (Go)
I'ma see ya when I do
Now get the fuck out my ride
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, I (Yeah, nigga, we back up in this thang)
Now get the fuck out my ride (Yeah, new machine)
They said I'd never ever see the sunlight (Tell 'em)
I thought I'd never ever see the sunlight
They said I'd never ever see the sunlight

Sometimes it drives me crazy (Look at the sky)
This all I got for you (Niggas)
That sunlight, it'll drive you crazy
What is God to you niggas?
God damn, motherfucker, uh

// CHAIN ON //

[Intro:]
One, two

[Kevin Abstract:]
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Fifth string, Young Peggy ring (Go)
Slick with the ink, these melodies need Duolingo (Shit)
Same size as Dua Lipa, where the fuck my pen go?
Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow
Street Fighter like Birdie, keep a stick like Rolento
Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potential?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies like That's So Raven
Bald-headed with lil status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be- (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat to take it
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die
No surprise, Zeus get jealous when you cut the ties
Livin' lie, Lance Armstrong at the finish line
Give it time, when we catch them cops on cam
I don't need six seconds, you remember Vine, it's nasty

[Kevin Abstract:]
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say
Go ahead, throw a chain on, nigga
Tell them boys where you came from, nigga
Tell 'em boys why I stay up late
Tryna say, tryna say, tryna say somethin', nigga, tryna say

[Dom McLennon:]
Hangin' from a chandelier in Babylon
We don't believe in white gods, they gettin' rattled on
Been in the belly of the kingdom, you can't tag along
Unless you got war on the mind, then get the shackles off
You can't ignore the karma when it's flames across your lawn
We checkin' corners, so make sure our lanes don't come across
See, word from Marvin, couldn't sue me from what's goin' on
Movin' through the system, sprintin' through a marathon
We don't get second chance
And they don't need a reason now, so I don't let 'em plan
When I been fighting for the truth, I bring some extra hands
Cement inside my gloves to knock this shit into the fan
Put that on everything I love, it's been a minute
Had to flip what's in my blood to be a stack
Had to handle other business, ain't no riddles, it's a fact
If you see me in my energy, ain't really tryna chat
That's the generations chargin' a battery in my back
See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors
Body just a vessel, brain tapped into the answers
Tried to see me on the CCTV, couldn't scan 'em
Like the serial was scratched off on the barrel of the brand
And I been ten toes down with the city on my shoulders
You got no idea how that weight could make you colder
Screamin', "Free my niggas," 'til they free us, never over
Spirit set aside for me to really be a soldier now

[Method Man:]
Cash rules everything around me (Uh)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar dollar bill y'all (Yeah), y'all (Yeah)

// COUNT ON ME //

You look so different to me
It's like you barely even, listen

You look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' from me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like Field Mob song, Trill Mob boy
She been MIA for too long, so far
Now catch the compensation
Change the conversation, dollars all I'm chasin'
Ain't talkin' money? Fuck is you sayin'?
I'm non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money, you can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money, you can count on me

Let's not fight the funk
She say I pour too much in my cup
Fuck the opposition, plus I'm still ridin' with it tucked
They say I should change the way I'm livin'
But just can't get enough
Still be quick to up that chopper on his block and hit 'em up
My lil brothers don't come home 'til November, I told 'em "We gon' live it up"
Can't do shit but pray for J Ron 'cause that nigga don't gave a fuck
Not at all, nigga, had my back against the wall, nigga
Momma told me I'd see it all, nigga

Yeah, who love you at your lowest of lows? I know, I mean
I'm in the backyard thinkin' I need, that smoke puffing outta my teeth
I'm good, I got my green, sittin' back sippin' ocean breeze
I don't got it, baby, ask them boys, all that hating turn to white noise
Tryna get red carpet fly, I don't flex my life, I don't lie
Treat life like I might die, don't like myself sometimes
But I bet that come with time, ever feel like ya head got screws?
A little bit loose, goddamn, give a fuck if I lose
Ain't no fool, he got dÃ©jÃ  vu
I'm the man, I'm the dawg, got juice
Just know I fucked up too
Talk like you got it figured it out and I wish I did too

It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money, you can count on me
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
It'll be okay, no matter what they say about us
I know that it'll be okay
You ain't even need no money, you can count on me

Count on me
Count on me

// BANKROLL //

Coo-coo
Yeah

Shit on your function
Live from the dungeon (Woop)
Don't know why you cuffin'
My dick she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this
Can't talk like this, woo
Safety pin on wrist
I put racks on my little bitch
Speakin' the truth, 2k a tooth, ooh
Maybach Jeep huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me but I am hater proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli in about a day or two
I am filled with lust
On a DM with Hype Williams, talkin' 'bout bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talkin' 'bout video treatments and such (Damn!)
But I'm busy loving on the IG Smut, damn, fuck
I'm a goat in a Lamb truck
Roll the video, pan up when you talk to me
Godzilla, trilla nigga, rip apart cities (Ooh-ooh)
Got niggas in the pocket of my varsity (Yeah!)

They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never short on that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walking with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Uh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Wan' take off my armor now
Can't afford not to splurge on her
Have to break down the Berlin Wall
Just to come talk to ya'
Who hurt ya'? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome with major plans
Know I'm hard, suck my consonants
Know I'm hard, suck my consonants
Make her run like a Boston bomb
I'm the one, yeah the one she wants
Wanna love me like Wimbledon
Raise the volume, ring alarm
Hands on my girl, it's a charm
Gotta passion, don't call her loud
Don't tell my shorty settle down
I wear her out like a hand me down
Don't say I'm too big for ya'
Make my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off
Your ex income minimum
Baby, run with some bigger Dons
Baby, run with some bigger Dons
I got da cash and it lasts 'cause I dash to the bag
My ice white like rice, diamonds flash like a light, ay

They couldn't take that from me
They want love, they got me, listen
You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place, always comin' in your dreams (Bankroll)

Lump up in my jeans, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Never short on that lil' green, I keep a bankroll (Bankroll)
And I'm walking with a limp, got too much bankroll (Bankroll)
Uh, huh, I got too much bankroll

Wanna be my main bitch? You gotta get the C.R.E.A.M.
To rollaround me in the Grenadines
Ya' gotta come through looking pristine
'Cause this bankroll is foreign
Ain't for no nab, that ain't going
Yeah, I'm getting money like I'm back in the east
Got me looking legit and they know it
And I'm counting it, ain't gotta show it off
See me in your spot, low key throwin' you off
If you talkin' 'bout cash in my ear like a kitty, you know that it's stayin' up
If you ain't on that move back, bro
Don't even talk to the gang, no
Walk around tilt with the bankroll
Keep putting stacks in the bankroll

You ain't have many friends but you the shit to me (Now catch the conversation)
Every time you at the party, it's a scene (Change the conversation)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Dollars, all I'm chasin')
Sunken place always comin' in your dreams (Fuck is you sayin'?)

// THE LIGHT //

I... give... my mom so... -ness
In the same house my dad died in, all alone
Trying not to be paranoid, trying not-... as they're calling it
'Cause every headline is a reminder that the world's fucked
So I've been tryna see the light
In between the clouds
Still love that sunshine

When I look at myself I see a broken man
Remnants of my Pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothin' ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep, suffocatin'
Can't face it, can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel
Alcohol and pills, deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel
A floral haven, hope it was painless
I see you in the faces, places and my makin'
Reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like who's there?
I can't stand myself beside myself, I see you there
I know you cared
Felt numb since September when I heard the news
What I'd do to speak one last time
Think I always will be haunted by the image of a bloody backdrop
Skull fragments in the ceilin', felt your presence in the room
Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blackin' out, bleedin' out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lyin'
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fadin' through a peep hole
Bedtime stories from purgatory
I miss you

For the record I can fly
Around the world absorbin' light
Something's missin' deep inside
The light

Somethin' changed in Texas, guess I missed the message
Look, I missed my exit, I'm livin' like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leanin' on my best friends
Only shot callers I was around was bar tendin'
Ain't no love in this game, mama, this is not tennis
Take your shoes off, we just did the carpets in
I can take the hatin', I can take the praisin'
It's all noise to me, I'll turn into Satan
Y'all stuck in the matrix, red pill, blue pill
All these different faces, all these different cases
Shit, y'all done seen me naked
So I'ma wear what I want now and I ain't finna fake it
Thank God I made it
Thank God I seen God last summer
I was standin' on a bridge, I seen all y'all under me
Know y'all strugglin', niggas out here jugglin'
Losin' jobs while losin' God and everything is tumblin'
Feel heaven rumblin', the rapture is comin'
I love the attention, I'm a bastard in public
I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgivin' come around, I still don't see 'em
When Christmas come around, nigga, I still don't see 'em
Told the world who I was before I got to know Ian
They gave my people money in exchange for their freedom
I would give it all back for a chance to free 'em

// WINDOWS //

Oh shit, I was just talking 'bout
Just that grind, the trenches, just
You know what I'm sayin', just all that
I mean, you, you don't get the vibe of it

Feels good to get this shit out the mud nigga
Made from hard times it's still love for the slums nigga
We rob niggas just because nigga
And I'll serve you anything but nothin' less than a dub nigga
And how it feel to be a dub nigga?
I'm tryna be a better man but nothin' less than a thug nigga
I kill shit, just check my background
This murder game shit my campground
Check my resume or ask 'round
We just simply never back down
I caught a charge, now I'm back out
I bet this carbon blow his back out
Gettin' money, that's a fact now
Bitches, they don't know how to act now

The poor more polite, but the flow not nice
Watch for your wife, I might take your her out ya life
She wet my white tee, now it's like a wet wipe
Respect my tribe, I'm a dog like Phife
Look at me like a check but my name not Nike
Bitch, my number not the lottery
I'm like don't even talk to me
Honestly wouldn't fly a Melbourne chick to Sydney
All of these bars bought chains, prison industry
America did my people foul, then they gimme shot for free
While I watch Washington's wood teeth in her booty cheeks
Kings of last century, was livin' like peasantry
I don't even like sleep, time is the only luxury

Sendin' a fuck you too you all
I'ma ship it, laminate it
Got this shit straight off the lot
We ain't rentin' no Avis
Got the neighbors goin' crazy
It's me, Bari and Flexy
I can see thru your bullshit like ya face was made of plexi
I could fuck around and get to soundin' like I'm whinin' man
Only crybaby is the one inside the bucket man
Who I'm the boogie man
You Never sleep again
Nightmares, it's fright-filled the moment Freddy tuck you in
Stack my money higher than the foam a top of tidal wave
Lonely like the point guard at the key got the isolate
Light it up, light it up
We bring the light show
Who the hell invited all they friends?
Fuck if I know

Dey at ya window
Dem boy callin' for you
Dey at ya window
Dem boy comin' for you
Dey at ya window
You bet not tell no lie
Dey at ya window
You know them boys outside
They at ya window
Them boy callin' for you
They at ya window
Them boys comin' for you
They at ya window
You bet not tell no lies
And they ain't comin' to play
You should not told no lies

My pen could be a fortune teller or an ATM
It's got intentions of its own, I can't even pretend
Every moment is a fight nobody can defend
The circumstances should've never been there to begin
I watch the clocks melt as the devil dances
The chances are slim to none that you could understand this
Lost language we incantin'
Pain campin'
Amongst the stillborn raindrops is where I'm standin'
I wake up breakin' up an eighth just to function
Rather be in neutral, than continue to get sunken
All my niggas made it out the motherfuckin' dungeon
Tank has been on E, but I gotta keep runnin'
What you finna lean on when the system is crumblin'?
Everybody reachin', but they really end up fumblin' when they touch down
Y'all don't appreciate in value like a bust down
My shit authentic, they can't ever get enough now

Dey at ya window
Dem boy callin' for you
Dey at ya window
Dem boy comin' for you
Dey at ya window
You bet not tell no lies
And they ain't comin' to play
You should not told no lies

I can see that eye upon me when I close mine
Drug induced comatosis leakin' through me blind
The body is the temple I invite spirits
We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds
Born to bleed
The brave and free got needs they gotsta feed
I breathe to see defeat
Fuck police and authority
Never means nothin' mind fuckin' myself to sleep
Had to take it to the streets
Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19
Those dirty hands that feed don't buy it
Government officials don't give a fuck about the children
What do you believe?
Nothing's ever what it seems till you can't deny it
Flash points and flash bangs dictate defiance
History stuck on repeat in the loop of sirens
Terrorizin', always lyin'
God damn tyrants
Don't play with knives, kids

I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love and they don't know you

I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love and they don't know you

Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
All or nothin'
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like

Just pick me up in the four door
I'll bless the beat with smoke and rain ash like Mordor
The warlord's comin', check the lamb for the slaughter
The envy so green it should be flyin' a saucer
And when the pressure is on, they gone
Ghost ride whippin' not your friends no more, so long
Snakes sneakin' I'm feelin' like I'm missin'
But never that
I'm still here bitch so God's winnin'
Lord willin'
There's no ceiling
They all pussy
Get out your feelings
Can try and run it up but baby I'm chillin'
I make my money then dip, stay killin'
Stay killin', stay killin', stay killin'

// I'LL TAKE YOU ON //

Maybe you
Could lift me out the struggle that I fell into
With all the crazy things that you put me through

The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

I wish it didn't end like this
You stopped lovin' me a long time ago, didn't notice
Pardon the waves, couldn't contain how I feel 'bout it
Easy to say I am to blame, no other way around it
How you say you don't love me like you used to
Solitude is becoming so unusual
Old news that you rush into everything
That's why I'm stuck here tellin' you, you

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

Say less
Rain check
We friends
I guess
I got regrets
Hop in Lexus
You don't hear me but I bought your earrings
From the PJ's, treat you like a heiress
I ain't trickin', but I got it for your hair and nails
I'm always treat 'em too good and it always fails
You a angel I'm the one that tripped and fell
Can't let go, I missed my own fairytale

I'm out my head, I'm in my notebook
I'm feeling hopeful
I joined The Band in Dylan's tour bus
Turn up my vocals
Still making faces at your GoPro
Like fuck the promo
I'll do the live show for a one horse town
The blue-black behind my eyelids of an unheard sound
The words cracked into a silence of a sun gone down
But no regrets Coyote Baby
You can watch me howl
We're just so different, you and I
I guess we both know now

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new
Idid this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

Wish I knew what it meant
When I said I loved you (I love you)
Rips in the threads of the net
I fell through (Ah)
What I gotta do for you?
Bet my life
Paid the price
Almost died
Shit was tight (For real)
What a life to lose
Beautiful and tragic, it rang true
Pleasure and pain, both remain (They do)
I was amazed in the maze with you
Said what I meant
Meant what I said too
If you only knew...

// WHAT'S THE OCCASION? //

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

I know my sweat like cologne, see this house ain't like home
If I could swallow my pride, would you admit when you wrong?
I know it's easy to just skip it, flippin' out and you gone
Maybe I wouldn't be so testy when you came my for glow
Got dinner on the kitchen table make sure everyone know
I make my Sunday mornings feel like Friday nights
I feel like Boobie Miles under these Friday lights
Ready to pounce on any pussy ass bitch come for my life
I'm tired of validation
I'm tired of wonderin' what the fuck
I gotta do to save ya
You been in this shit for years, I can't be ya savior
Hearin' speech from Satan
On my knees, I'm prayin'
Everything I say breakin' into

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

I stay runnin' from somethin'
I can't see
True colors blindin', fuck away from me
Gunnin' for somethin' I don't need
I lead two lives, find me
Who's to blame?
Who's to say I leave?
Forced to change, forced to face my seed
Break a bit, breakin' in timely
Good on my own but I've been feelin' alone
I gotta go, don't ask why
Watch the dominoes and the time fly
Either way it goes, scribble outta line
Get the picture, different from when I met ya

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

// WHEN I BALL //

My momma said I didn't come into this world with tears
Instead I welcomed her with open eyes and open ears
Became the glue to a few things that couldn't be repaired
We saw our future in each other blendin' hope and fear
Some things you don't get to decide, it's just a fate you share
I used to try to hold the weight that she would need to bear
Watched uncles goin' on vacation for a couple years
When they came back they needed clothes and had no souvenirs
I pick up the phone, they're callin' us from correction
But nothin' is wrong, it's fillin' my heart with questions
My momma is home, I'm followin' her expressions
A drop in her tone, some things that she had to mention
I nodded, I listened, she had all of my attention
When you on your own, there's gonna be some directions
I need you to follow and never make an exception
I nodded, she held me and wished I would be protected

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see, it's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be

On my sucker free shit since I was a fetus
Pullin' up at the doc in a Mazda 626
Bet my dad was trippin' bad, hit the gas like car chase
Light blue in the back, momma gettin' labor pains
Dropped my sister at the bulls like house was 23
Sweat drippin' down the face like river runnin' free
Dark mornin' with the fog pourin' in and out the trees
Every movement through they eyes seem to zoom at light speed
Before me she lost one still born tragedy
Grittin' the teeth down to the root, pain like a cavity
Holdin' hands like they glued Radio channel on news
Valentines with a x up on the calendar
They knew I would be a fuckin' baller like them posters on the wall
A little stain could be the beauty in it all
Amidst all the trouble most ya luck was rubbin' off
Stickin' to ya like moss
You my Kate, you my rock, forever

You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be with you

Here I go
I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up let go and look at me
You'll always be
A part of me

Here I go
I'm gonna spread my wings
All grown up let go and look at me
You'll always be
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me
A part of me

// DON'T SHOOT UP THE PARTY //

All American self-hatred runs deep
White boys all I see whenever I sleep
Niggas think I think these thoughts on purpose
But I knew 'bout *NSYNC 'fore cash could rule me
Colonized minds by masters and slaves
They both hate niggas, act like niggas a shame
Homophobic, I tried to gang bang
I tried to get laid, I had to get paid
Hopped off the ship, I land on my feet
In Corpus Christi I got my own street
Runnin' this shit like it's a track meet
I had to go back home, I seen too many niggas die in a week
I give my dogs black wealth, let 'em live well
What a miracle we dreamed a million stories to tell
You are now tuned in, baby, to the new classic
New machine, keep the peace, keep 'em dancin'

Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up my party
Please, please
Please, please

This a jam for you whims and you woes
For the people in the back standin' on they tippy toes
Don't give a damn what the journalist wrote
Always dead inside like they in the catacombs
On the prowl like a lion in his throne
Watchin' for the prey that might slit his throat
It's 'bout time that I let your ass know
Y'all deserve the guillotine even mo'
Kiss my ass, treat my balls like it's mistletoe
Fuck class, get cash by the truckload
Latest album with my dogs but the city closed
You in for a hell of a ride, uh oh
This a good time, know I'm damn right
Order every single bottle of the best wine
Fuck if I know, need it all though
Dedicate this to my family in Chicago

Stay down, I'm sorry
Stay down, you're ugly
The people need more of the money
These white people don't love me
Stay down, I'm sorry
Stay down, I'm hungry
I don't need you to love me
Fuck you, come fuck me I know

Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the party
Please, please
Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up my party
Please, please
Please, please

What's the issue?
Why you gotta grab that pistol?
Think about who gon' miss you
Never know what I been through
What's the issue?
Why you gotta grab that pistol?
Think about who gon' miss you
Never know what they might do

Don't shoot up the party
Don't shoot up the p-

Who you really wanna try to step to?
Who you really wanna try to step to?

// DEAR LORD //

Dear Lord
Lord, will You come down and help out my brother
So please Lord
He needs You more
I want You to let him know that he's still loved
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight (Where do I go now?)
So God bless you, love
Heal him with Your light
Oh, you're prayin' all the time
He'll show you to the light
Hold him in Your light
Hold him in Your light
Show him Your light, aw yeah
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight
Waiting by Your side
He just needs Your love and Your light

// THE LIGHT PT. II //

[Joba:]
The light
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"

[Kevin Abstract:]
Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chapelle's Show
Bitch, I can handle the truth, that's how I entered the booth
Look at these bruises I got, it gave me so much confidence
Back when I was making songs at my momma's crib
The candles lit, the temperature risin'
What type of man can find the right time to fly in?
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul, should've protected all my pantings
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-Aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city, couldn't save me from the world
Back then, had Yeezy on repeat in your whip, no peace in my streets
And these days no license, only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo'
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teaching me how to learn 'bout empty, even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box, expectin' me to see the light

See the light, see the light
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
All my niggas to the left-right, left-right, left-right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light

[Joba:]
When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the life-giver, lookin' back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp, before your life flash
What happens when you die? Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry, all I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleetin' moments, always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt, if I'm man enough
What's the use? I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in, always young enough to feel loved
And share some, are you lookin' down?
And a child reachin' out, brittle bone, crying now
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd self-destruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth, I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be a little man, following your footsteps
Even though I'm mad, even though you're gone
You live on, and the day I have kids
I'll tell 'em 'bout Grandpa and how great he is
And the grandkids' grandkids
You'll never meet if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be, neither would they
It's safe to say I'll find a way out the darkness
The way you left ma hits me the hardest
What a shame things change in the blink of an eye
Fade away, fast break to the depths in the sky
Impermanence turn permanent with a nine
That's life, that's life

The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
