// BEN CARSON //

[Ameer Vann:]
Dressed in the same shit I wore yesterday
Yeah, it's still fresh, never flexed clichÃ©s
I never write a verse and repeat the same thing
Cause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame
Made in the projects, slave to my progress
I only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts
You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab
But I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside
Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax
Cause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS
The trap ain't free, you better realize that
But imma get money, no tests on the desk
Fuck the SAT's, smoking Sunday's best
Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?

[Merlyn Wood:]
I don't know difference, mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this
Question next is why my mention so menstrual?
I be going ham on Ray street eating tofu
Loiter at the wholefoods, sipping kombucha
Yeah I went green but the black will still do ya
Damn, she used to be my number one, past tense
Past time chillin, evolved into the villian
Sunday school friends
In search of second circumcisions
Nah, keep your opinions
We was mallrats just cheesin' for the pictures
Now who can circumvent us?

// MICHIGAN //

[Kevin Abstract:]
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing men
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
The whip right there, and it's parked outside
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing men
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
The whip right there, and it's parked outside

Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
Let us pray for more rain

But who really knows? (Let us stay for more pain)
But who really knows? (Let us stay for more pain)

Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down
And the whip right there, and it's parked outside

I get, I get, I get
Let us stay for more rain
I get, I get, I get
Let us pray for more rain
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more rain
I'll be waiting for you
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
I'm always lookin' for you

// INFATUATION //

[Merlyn Wood:]
You fired, you fired (For Joie!)
Shorty shot, shorty shorty shot, shorty shorty shot- (x8)
Shorty shot me out the atmosphere, well this one year
I was flying high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shorty shot, shorty shorty shot, shorty shorty shot- (x8)
Shorty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flying high in the pimp plane atmosphere

[Chorus:]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora come home, you been searchin' too long

[Rodney Tenor:]
Shit
High-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shorty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin' I'm hittin'
I'm was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you, I wonder if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through with your false disguise
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

[Chorus:]
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora come home, you been searchin' too long

[Merlyn Wood:]
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy?
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DM's on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

[Joba:]
[*Angelic humming*]

// BREAKFAST //

[Kevin Abstract:]
(So I built you a house)
Tryna find revenge in the dark, I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard, I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil, your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me, my parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me but he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me but he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect

[Ameer Vann:]
I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of Fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and Alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I kept to myself

[Interlude - Ariel Wendt:]
Through the quicksand, the wind, and the bush in between
Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need and chose to turn to each other in order to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all, but this is difficult
Challenging, there's something different in the air
The clouds are changing, weapons, love, heartbreak, and everything in between
Dirty, filthy boys
Don't let this one die

// CONTACTS //

[Rodney Tenor:]
I want your number in my telephone so that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone so that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone so that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone so that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my (Oh, oh)
I want you in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms again

// PALACE //

On a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round

I feel like fucking on the west side our parents are all gone
Girl
These strangers are coming out about twice as strong
I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me

Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round

I feel like fucking on the west side our parents are all gone
And these strangers are coming out about twice as strong
I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost

I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I'm everything I am
I'm everything I am
But you don't know me
I'm everything I am
With everything I am
You don't know me
At all
At all, at all, at all
At all
At all (You don't know)
At all, at all, at all
At all

// FLIP MO //

[Merlyn Wood:]
I just dropped out
I got my liberty
Acting like hot celebrity
Actually, I'm a rapper
Please...
You a dropout?
No food in your mouth now
No weed in your mouth now
And no You in yo mom's house
(That don't sound so bad now)
Cause you ain't got no bed now
And all them niggas banked on
Is backing out like a ringtone that's
Pop, lock and dropping
So I had to take that
Pot and ziploc it

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm smoking blunts with Barack
Money inside of a sock
Stage diver holding my cock
You busy holding the block
And I've been refining my vision
You make the decision
We flexing in public, you love it
It's bullshit around me
I'm living above it
We too busy getting these buckets, nigga
Higher than the summit for the nuggets, nigga
Work on the canvas like Samo
I'm off the chain like I'm Django
Never been one for the labels
What do you bring to the table?
Nigga, stop speaking in fables
I'm a young misfit looking for the quick flip
Left hook take you out of this district
Watch a nigga's soul leave his existence
Hit a lick then I hop on my nimbus
Vicious

// HOME //

[Matt Champion:]
Try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
'Cause when you say I got a girl
Say it, I know it's killin' you
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you

[Matt Champion & Joba:]
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love

[Joba:]
Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why
[Matt Champion:]
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still [?]
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my Wild West
Come on baby you can put it us
Come on baby you can put it on me

[Matt Champion & Joba:]
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love
Do you know it's alright?
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I got your love

// COTTON HOLLOW //

[Dom McLennon:]
Falling for the wrong one
Feeling like the right time
But at least I felt something
Think I'm losing my mind

I'm in need of your love
I just need you right here
Sharing all of those things
Whispering in my ear
Tell me what they can't know
Show me what they can't see
Tell me all the ideas
They would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees
I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze
I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I'm tripping
You catching me slipping
Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling
First day back cause the demons keep calling
Look at this world and I start withdrawing
And its so hard not to fade, see its so hard not to fall
But I gotta find peace
And I gotta find sleep cause I don't see it at all
So I'm going, going, going, deeper and deeper
You see I'm finding it out before my spirit gets weaker
I got a fever, fever
But feeling sick in the head
I need a doctor, doctor
Or just one more cigarette
I'm saying

Falling for the wrong one (I love you)
Feeling like the right time (I love you)
But at least I felt something
Think I'm losing my mind

If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can tear your face up but don't act like you ain't earn that [x4]

[Merlyn Wood:]
Oh yeah she fine
Soft from behind
Like I'm running out of time
Yeah she hurt your fucking feelings with that
Ass to hers
Dunno just to what I'm feeling with uh-
Get on her
How cannot tell I'm feeling its like-
I'm in her
World. living, breathing
You know I'm not even Steven
Cause I could not be
Shia born in a house fire, damn
Baby, where you do that
I'ma little bit insane, yeah
Put you on game, yeah
Make you maintain, yeah
Stare up in your lane, yeah
Whatever you say, yeah
Alway-always say yeah
Rather see me dead, yeah
Than see me in your bed yeah, yeah, yeah

// POISON //

[Matt Champion:]
You are just poison
I put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behave

But your love is poison
I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

[Ameer Vann:]
You are my drugs
You are what I need
The love of my life
You kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend
I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak
If I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds
But I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground
I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank
We ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name
But I remember your scent
And I remember your face
And I remember theâ¦
And I remember the days
We wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change
I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom's to blame

[Matt Champion:]
You are just poison
I put that on my grave
No need for aggression
I just need to behave

But your love is poison
I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction
I know that you want control

Poison [x4]

// LOST IN LOVE //

[Joba (Kevin Abstract):]
Your lipstick burns my lips
But I think I'm still in love with you
Your eyes drip black
But I think you're still in love with me
But it feels like there's no air to breathe again (In the pink skies)
And it feels like I'm drowning in love again (I can't swim)
I'm afraid I'll lose all that I have again (Her eyes were red)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Joba:]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la) [x4]

I've been a fool (ooo, aa-aah)

[Joba (Kevin Abstract):]
You say I care too much
But what does that even mean
You say I need some space
But what does that mean for me
It feels like I've fallen and fell again (The car crash)
And it feels like there's no hope for us again (You were high as hell)
I'm afraid you'll leave me for a better man (I try my hardest)
But I'm ready for the truth (Love me not)

[Joba:]
I'm so lost in love (la la, la la) [x4]

[Joba & Kevin Abstract:]
My head was spinning (I've been a fool)
I lost, I lost it (I've been a fool)
I've been a fool (Ooo, aa-ah)
Aa-ha-haaa
