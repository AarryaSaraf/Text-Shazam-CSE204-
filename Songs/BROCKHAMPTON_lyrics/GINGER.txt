Album: GINGER

// NO HALO //

I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling

I ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana to Atlanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Pulled in by the sight of you up on the couch, so cosy
Know that you look like rosey cheeks
Or are you so cosy with somebody else?
Get nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'ma be ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late night corner, we pass
Flick that switch and get ready
Used to skip around the pain
We don't go there no more
We don't see sun no more

Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything from pots and pans to fans like GoldenEye
Everything 'cept the door
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect but it's never gettin' solved

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)

Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess
Never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it outta bed
Time-bomb under it
Persuading you to hop in

Mm, options, runnin' out of options
Mm, options, used to have options
Mm, options, runnin' out of options
Mm, options, used to have options

I don't know where I'm going
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling
I don't know where I'm going
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rolling

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)

Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
The pressure put me in the places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth, they said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weaving our fate are getting harder to please
But I believe to an extreme (We all can find a way)
To anybody listening that's in between (We all can find a way)

Went to church for the hell of it
Stumbled in drunk as shit, been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wondering who I am
Been thinking I am better than him
In times like these I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

I wash it out of all of me to feel the fire
(Maybe I'll be gone for a minute and)
But you know, you know that's a lie
(No one helped me when my eyes go)
I wash it out of all of me to feel the fire
(Maybe I'll be gone for a minute and)
But you know, you know that's a lie
(No one helped me when my eyes go)

I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my eyes go red)
I'm sure I'll find it
(No one helped me when my, no one helped me when my)

// SUGAR //

Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
Change your mind when I change my life, better start believing in myself
And we all now, looking for, looking for God, so we never see it in ourselves
Shit, divine intervention, move in stealth
It's hard to tell what do prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime on the graveyard got a nigga feelin' real
My instability's trademark, copywritten in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of living
Tear my temple down into a prison

Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
You slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
That lens zooming in, catching all my stripes
Used to trade a joint for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night
Forties suffice, I'm only alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm acting foolish
Could you pick me up around noonish?
Half a blunt, yeah we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Time to take a seat and yeah we cruisin'

And I love right, I love you right
All by yourself, but I make it right
Baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you
I want you

Spending all my nights alone, waiting for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waiting for
Tell me what I'm waiting for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

Back and forth, I'll take that if that's all you're asking for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport -p- passport

So, do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me, ohh

Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, love me
Do you love me? Love me, ohh

// BOY BYE //

I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em (Yeah)
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend (Alright)
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun

Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin (Sheesh)
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin' (Shit)
Actin' like Regina, you a lil' bit dramatic (George)
I been in the cockpit, I been in the cabin (Right)

Oh, so hot, so, sst, get branded
I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it

[Kevin Abstract:]
Trauma got me fucked up, my mama got me fucked up
My lil' nigga locked up, it's like Hakuna Matata
Never liked sci-fi, empathetic wifi
Keep it in the back room, hidin' with my dry eye
Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh

[Matt Champion & Merlyn Wood:]
My bitch, she so pretty, pretty (Mmh)

Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Mmh)
My bitch is so pretty, pretty (Mmh)
I get cash like really, really (Get it)
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly (Boy, bye)

[Bearface:]
Ring in their ears like a bark
Always feel left in the dark
Trauma the price for the patience
Character shift like an arc
Move like my shit stay in park
Don't feel the love or respect
Grip like a hand on my neck
This is the year, place your bets
Boy, bye

[Joba & Merlyn Wood:]
Ooh, ooh, beautiful and bashful
Ooh (Mmm), ooh, ooh (Mmm)
I'm beautiful and bashful
Boy, bye
Goddamn (Sheesh)

// HEAVEN BELONGS TO YOU //

Immerse myself in discontent
Hoping you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger

What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze' sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me' now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me' but hey it wasn't me (Boo, boo, boo)
Like God can judge me' but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judging me
I walk on water, paint and touch' what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only see-see me when I'm doing burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen

Fuck God, I'ma dog backwards
Backwoods, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you saying? Why you praying for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you saying? Why you praying for forgiveness?
Whole lot of shit and some bitches, like
(Mhh, mhh, ha, yeah, fuck it, yeah, yeah)

Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law

Cup runneth over for a hunnid orders (Ayy, ayy)

Smokin' 'em out like a habit

We holdin' all our money in the mattress (Ayy)
Fire rapid like a savage (Ayy)
Taste is way above your pallet (Ayy)

Take a break to pick apart the balance of this madness

[bearface:]
Uh

You be runnin' like the snot drainin' in from your nose
That's that ice cream, sugar, that cocaine throat

Boy, this shit long gone, why you hit my phone? (Whoa!)

Murder man, murder man

// IF YOU PRAY RIGHT //

[Dom McLennon:]
Hallelujah (Hey), holy lion, word to Judas (Hey)
How I'm supposed to (Hey)
Trust that what you say is the truest? (Right)
Halie Selassie (Uh), insha'Allah if I gotta (Woo)
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala, for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart
That make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testing
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operating like specialists
One, to the two, to the, "Who are you?"
Sending out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards (Right)
It's a deficit in your settlement
You better learn to mind all your manners (Right)
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle (Right)
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble, boo (Right)

[Kevin Abstract:]
Hiding at my partner's house
Couple bands inside the mouth
Instead of feeling trippy, dog
You need to help your city out
Hiding at my partner's house
Couple bands inside the mouth
Instead of feeling trippy, dog
You need to help your city out

Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple bands ins-, couple bands ins-
Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple bands inside the mouth
Couple bands ins-, couple bands ins-

[Matt Champion & {Merlyn Wood}:]
Watch your back (Ayy), don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back (What), don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse
{If you, if you, if you, if you, hey}

[Merlyn Wood:]
If you want a feature we can figure it out
Want a color for your album, we can figure it out
Have you noddin' by boys who call it, "You're all out"
Then they copy, paste hard work from the BH house
I always got something to say
When you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say we helped you when I win
Now you should figure it out
Figure it out

[Kevin Abstract:]
Hiding at my partner's house
Couple bands inside the mouth
Instead of feeling trippy, dog
You need to help your city out

[Joba:]
Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you hoe bitch
Witness sadistic shit, well come again
Next time I'll take my belt off, spank you
Back here, back seat, not me, got beef
Finally, body black out from rage
Childproof my pockets
Don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly

Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law

[Kevin Abstract:]
I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything
That I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties, .45's?
I'm still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know betta, betta, betta, betta, betta
Betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, bet on it
Betta bet on it, betta bet on it, hey
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know betta
Betta, betta, betta, be-et on it
Bet on it, eh, eh, eh, eh, yeah
Eh, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
(You tell 'em, tell 'em that)
Ah
(Walking with Jesus Christ)
(Walking with the Lord)

// DEARLY DEPARTED //

[Kevin Abstract:]
I pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I pray I make it outta Texas
I pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can Jesus send me a message?
What's the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA, that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies, it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

[Joba:]
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try, I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try

[Matt Champion:]
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows, truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high, expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)

[Dom McLennon:]
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker

// I BEEN BORN AGAIN //

[Bearface:]
Out on the deck like I'm wildin' for respect
It's a three-peat, see-see
Bitch, you in the D-League
Boy, you fucked up
Can't come around here, this shit is gated
We made it, happy belated, I see the rage hit

[Kevin Abstract:]
It's better if I try not to talk about the shit that's always on my mind
Money on my mind (That's right), couple hunnids at a time
Try to fuck me blind, duckin' down, hear me whine (Ooh)
We outside now (That's right), milk carton in the back
We don't like to fuck around with them niggas in the back
Pullin' triggers in the 'Lac (That's right)
May the praise stay bad
Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right)
Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress
Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards
Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit
Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still
Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here
God gave me a good deal
Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel
Bitch, I wanna hit still
This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them
Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman (That's right)

[Merlyn Wood:]
Like I'm Dennis Rodman
Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem (That's right)
Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend
Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem (That's right)
She so bad, I let her touch my butt (Yeah)
Merlyn, what the fuck?

[Dom McLennon:]
Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' (That's right)
It ain't no one business who or what we doin' (That's right)
Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin'
To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance

[Joba:]
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right)
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'

[Henock Sileshi:]
Go ahead and try harder
You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get on your damn knees
And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there
That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves

[Matt Champion:]
Send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
They ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
Send 'em-send 'em out the door
They ain't knockin' no more
They-they-they ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no more
(That's right)

Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind

[Dom McLennon & (bearface):]
I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
(Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
I don't wanna take this ride
(Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
I don't wanna take this ride
(Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white)
Pull out your mind

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

// BIG BOY //

[Kevin Abstract:]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

If I had another
I'm a bad motherfucker
Got love for my mother
The city that protect me
I don't fuck with y'all like I used to though
But you could come around for the Houston baby, oh

I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

[Joba:]
Who the Hell am I?
Who the Hell are you?
Don't waste my time, I got shit to do
Been in love with you, don't know what to do
Still searchin' for the truth, every which way
Mental foreplay, bound by cuffs to you
Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better (Make me better)

[bearface:]
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream that you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
I just hope your lil' bro grow to be great (Ayy)
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream where you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
One in the clip, and one in the chamber (Yeah)
We was riding in the dark, you were putting your legs up (Legs up)
Girl, I don't know, maybe I should just stay shut (Stay shut)
Did I ruin your life baby, even from day one? (Uh-uh)
If it was another life, maybe you could still save us (Ooh-ooh)

[Kevin Abstract:]
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me

You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin

// LOVE ME FOR LIFE //

[Kevin Abstract:]
What I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's J-Lo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though

[Joba:]
Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced (Uh-huh), insane

[Merlyn Wood:]
Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy
My weed, my weed at the party
Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
You know

[bearface:]
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, wish you would lie
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, I will
Love, love me for, yeah
Love me, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for
Love, love me for life
Love, love you for
Love you for

// VICTOR ROBERTS //

[Victor Roberts II:]
My fuckin' Power Rangers couldn't protect me from that LAPD kick door
Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
"There that shit go"
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
"Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes"
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, "Oh fuck"
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be

And if you're hurting, love yourself with my heart
