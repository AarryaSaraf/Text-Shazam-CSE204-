// HEAT //

[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto
Este es mi amigo, Jabari
Nosotros odiamos a la policÃ­a

[Ameer Vann:]
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I'll send a bitch to get ya
So don't play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money
I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I'll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm
I love when bitches bleed
If she's sucking on the barrel, you can't hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet
This aggravated Larson
And then I'm out the door
It's monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go
The first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Merlyn Wood:]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
And you'll be thin, you'll be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine from the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, here go another pistol
Ha, fuck, another cracka!
Cop coming on my block for the answers
Huh? I no got time for your question
Huh, just put mi mommy and mi bredren

[Dom McLennon:]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I'm tryna change, but it'll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain't meant for life but that's too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I'm drowning in the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates
I'm trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that's on the fuckin' menu
I'm dancing with myself; setting fire to the venue, motherfucker

[Ameer Vann:]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go
The first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Joba:]
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you

[Matt Champion:]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should've shot him
Pray to god about him
Man, I hit the lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder
Shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches
So now it's off to millions
I been fucking sinning
Hit the forehead, chest, left, right, I'm grinning
Asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings
For all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain
'Fore all you changed on me
Rearranged on me
Suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended
And this ain't clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me
Sippin' Cris' on ya
Bet ya life on it
I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I'm burning rubber, I pulled up on you

// GOLD //

[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto
Y Ã©sta es mi cadena

[Kevin Abstract:]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Matt Champion:]
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like whoop, bang
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit

[Kevin Abstract:]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood:]
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide butâ
I just wanna feel up the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

[Kevin Abstract:]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Merlyn Wood:]
Damn, damn, I'm frosty
Blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning
But you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's
Hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me
Punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin'
Honda-swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn

[Dom McLennon:]
Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zorro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters 'cause this ice
Might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight

[Kevin Abstract:]
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect
(Keep a gold chain) Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

[Joba:]
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
I keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)
Keep a gold chain (I said I keep a, gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain (cause then I keep a)
(I said I keep a gold chain, a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
(I said I keep a, I keep a)
Keep a gold chain (fly, fly as a jet)

// STAR //

[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto
Y yo quiero ser famoso

[Dom McLennon:]
I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's sea biscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer going Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics

[Ameer Vann:]
I'm the black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Put my mama in a Range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic Cage with the face off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Ritchie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely, but she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission, Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a R&B singer, bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar, MJ my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves, Iggy Nick got issues
H-Town with BeyoncÃ©, turn her to my prom date
Kingpin like JAY-Z, dance moves like JT

[Kevin Abstract:]
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
'Less the nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench press
High school, they ain't fuck with me
Now the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber takin' all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight I get seasick
Did ya see all that, all that we did?
Did all this shit in the weekend
We was up all late tweakin' (yeah!)
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' Leo's blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me
Like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play
Got the same last name as O.J

[Video Outro - Kevin Abstract:]
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn
Two, oh, oh, seven
Two, oh, oh, eight
Two, oh, oh, nine
You, I can't relate
You, a different place
You, a different space
You, I hesitate, for you I never wait
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
(Everything that's perfect, damn)
You're everything that's perfect, damn

[Ameer Vann & Merlyn Wood:]
I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it, have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas, Southside One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens, got lens that make direction
Flow to my location, lowkey I'm in Cali just
Avoiding my probation, fuck your jurisdiction
Fuck the Federales, sold out by my father
He gon' feel the karma when I get the- get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six, nigga

[Matt Champion:]
Lowkey I'm a heart-throb and I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster, sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face make her take her clothes off
Y'all say y'all got bitches but y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad cause I'm feeling myself
What the fuck you mean, I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban, but now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity, but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good

They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me

[Dom McLennon:]
In the city I'm a menace, I give CEOs the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them, but they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I love made me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top, just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids, give me love before you try to give me noise
I destroy

[Kevin Abstract:]
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys

[Ameer Vann:]
I got some demons on me
They been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions
And my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives
Mama called the Reverend
I know she praying for me
But I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo
Kicking doors my MO
I got some bad habits
I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale
I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies
I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house
I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me
I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her
Damn I miss you momma

[Kevin Abstract:]
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me

Shadow keep following me

[Kevin Abstract:]
Yippy yay, yippy yay, hit me on my cellu' phone
Yippy yay, yippy yay, I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy yay, yippy yay, I know you niggas need some more

[Ameer Vann:]
Nigga talk shit? I'll single you out
If you've got a problem we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
Southside niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice 'fore you open you mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, bit of gas in the blunt
Send em to the doc, gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas chase money 'til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come and get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Ohhh, don't say that

[Kevin Abstract:]
Yippy yay, yippy yay, hit me on my cellu' phone
Yippy yay, yippy yay, I'll be right back with the dope

Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be alone

[Dom McLennon:]
Uhhh, I feel like Master P
I ain't no slave, ain't lettin no one try to massa me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
That sugar coated shit don't need them extra calories
It's a machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Put em up for me, display it like it's a gallery
Don't need your salary, gold on me like it's alchemy
Giving niggas the battery when they witness the mastery
Uhhh, don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got chalk for me, I make outlines like it's pottery
I got a squad full of fucking oddities
I got squash, apricots and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
It's like uhhh

[Kevin Abstract:]
Yippy yay, yippy yay, hit me on my cellu' phone

[Merlyn Wood:]
I look like a Somali pirate (don't say that!)
Failed middle school and college (don't say that!)
Daddy say I'm an asshole (don't say that!)
Dick complexion of a Backwoods (eww, don't say that)
She text me, dry as the Sahara (oh wow!)
After she get in that casa Merlyn (straight up!)
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight as a hair tie (ah, ooh ooh)
Scrunchie, I'm so horny baby, bitch your house, pussy baby
When I get the munchies I steal, I don't share roaches baby
Bum with the good haircut
Bum with a good haircut, mattress and magic dick

[Dom McLennon:]
See I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin, just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossing, I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins since you told me you was walkin'
I've been searchin, huntin, crawlin
Whats it costin' me it ain't doing much, tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head for a minute so I can listen to you
And all I ever heard was "I ain't listenin", shit is cripplin'

[Ameer Vann:]
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop em let me know
'Cos I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer let me know
I was sellin cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas, with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin' kickin' in the doors

[Kevin Abstract & Dom McLennon:]
Niggas on that word of mouth, said they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out

[Kevin Abstract:]
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck direction, my nigga

Flying on my rocket ship
I'm on an acid trip
I need another pill
Snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends
We're getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs
We suffocatin'
We get all our drug and medication
You came with black folks
Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me
Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends

[Dom McLennon:]
Everybody smilin'
I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends
Guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes
I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny
Wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey
Save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void
I don't know what I discovered
I know I could hear the thunder
I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger
I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't want to pay my mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have 'em yet
I'm ballin' and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
Keep God in my hands so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened

[Dom McLennon:]
Fell in love but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rank when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't trippin', I'm just feelin' what I say
I ain't talkin', I'm just spillin' from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasin' sanity while niggas chasin' clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl, I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?

[Kevin Abstract:]
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
I love it on you, though, I love it on ya
I love it on ya
I love it on ya
I love it on ya
I love it on ya
I love it

// BUMP //

[Matt Champion:]
Tuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

[Merlyn Wood:]
We gon' ride, ride, ride down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
We gon' ride white lines all the way to Mexico
Merlyn! Merlyn!

[Kevin Abstract:]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (ahhhh!)

[Ameer Vann:]
I've been trappin' out my momma house, dope boy
Money keep the water and the lights on, spray it like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood rich
Chillin' at the gallows, smokin' Blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram, now tell me who you fuck with

[Kevin Abstract:]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live (ahhhh!)

[Dom McLennon:]
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't here to talk now, nigga, we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin' time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
BROCKHAMPTON the clan, bitch, I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch, I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring 'em in the world
My little spawns of Satan just might take off with your fucking girl

[Matt Champion:]
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk

[Kevin Abstract:]
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live

Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

Rollin' in my truck, gotta keep it tucked
Because whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag, neighbors call me "fag"
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag

[Merlyn Wood:]
Whose society is this?
Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship?
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music, make them rich
Play our music, make amends
Box us in like plantains
Free all of my Africans
Nigga, I slay, nigga I waste them, them, waste them

[Kevin Abstract:]
There go that danger boy, danger boy!
There go that danger boy, danger boy!

[Ameer Vann:]
Niggas kill you for a dollar
Listen to 'em holler
Big blood ballers, with a crown on my corner
Crack and marijuana, slab around the corner
Sitting low elbows, syrup on the dashboard

[Kevin Abstract:]
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

[Dom McLennon:]
I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cause I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cause the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's

[Joba:]
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world

[Jabari Manwa:]
Hoe, do you ever feel like you don't belong?
'Cause I know sometimes I feel that way

[Robert Ontenient:]
Si? O sea... no sÃ©... Hay dÃ­as que uno piensa
No sabes cuÃ¡l es tu sitio en el mundo, no sabes cuÃ¡l es el sitio en tu grupo de amigos, no sabes cÃ³mo... No sÃ©... O sea, sÃ­... Hay dÃ­as que uno no se siente cÃ³modo en su propia piel... Y es duro, es dÃ­ficil... Pero... No sÃ©... uno...

[Jabari Manwa:]
Nice pants

[Robert Ontenient:]
...Gracias

[Ameer Vann:]
I ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women, and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

[Merlyn Wood:]
Hi, my name is Merlyn
I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school
Hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase
And a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke
And whip an Audi Coupe crazy if I did that
Wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pit falls
Of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters
And that make you feel accepted 'til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves
Well...

[Kevin Abstract:]
I gotta get better at being me
(Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything
(Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with
(Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with
(Being who I am)

Ever since I moved out I've been broke
Ever since I grew up I've been ugly
Ooh, and I need get me some dollar
Dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad
And I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used
I miss my boy being around

I gotta get better at being me
(Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything
(Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with
(Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with
(Being who I am)

[Matt Champion:]
Droppin' all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday

[Kevin Abstract:]
I gotta get better at being me

[Dom McLennon:]
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass, and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known but everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father
Still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels
What if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears
You wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story

[Video Intro - Robert Ontenient:]
Me llamo Roberto
Y vamos a destruir nuestra casa

[Joba:]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?

[Dom McLennon:]
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves that crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for ya
I'm taking a stand for ya, I care for ya

[Matt Champion:]
What's your motive with me baby
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head
Cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect
Sometimes I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
Cause I know thousand men want ya
Wants the menages
Fucking riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

[Joba:]
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?

[Ameer Vann:]
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you come)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sun rise and it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed
I wake up in a cold sweat

[Joba:]
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main boy, your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?

// WASTE //

[Bear//Face:]
Was I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk

[Bear//Face (R. Gomez):]
Losing my way, ohh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(No worries) Losing my way, ohh
(Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy)
Seeing your name
(Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry)
But I'll be fine, yeah (no worries)
Yeah yeah yeah (no worries)
Yeah yeah yeah (no worries)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Bear//Face:]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
