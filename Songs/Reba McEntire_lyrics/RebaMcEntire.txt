// Glad I Waited Just For You //

Use to be (Use to be)

Love was mean to me

Every love I tried my heart cried that won't do

Now you see (Now you see)

Love's been good to me I guess my love was waiting just for you

You and me (You and me) (You and me)

Go so well as we

Fit right to a T

Can't you see we do


Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)

Your love's got a way

Of making me glad

I waited just for you

I should have known

That my heart could not be wrong


Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)

Your love's got a way

Of making me glad

I waited just for you

I should have known

That my heart could not be wrong


Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)

Your love's got a way

Of making me glad

I waited just for you

I should have known

That my heart could not be wrong


Gotta say (Gotta say) (Gotta say)

Your love's got a way

Of making me glad

I waited just for you

I should have known

That my heart could not be wrong

// One To One //

One to one

You and me

Anyone with eyes can plainly see

How it is with you and me


One to one

From now on

In each other's arms where we belong

And how we love when we're alone


We have so much between us

We know each other's needs

And you make it oh so good

When it's just you and me


One to one

You and me

Anyone with eyes can plainly see

Oh how it is with you and me


One to one

From now on

In each other's arms where we belong

Oh how we love when we're alone


One to One

// Angel In Your Arms //

Do you think I'm such a fool

To believe everything you say is true

Well that just goes to show

That you really don't know

While you're out painting the town

Do you think I'm home just sitting around

Waiting on you

Now who's really the fool


When I first found out I hurt all over

I felt so left out till I got to know her

So I drived away as she got over

And I became just like her


So don't be surprised to find that

The angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Yes the angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight


Why'd you slip around secretly

If you were tired of loving me

Why do you keep holding on

When love was already gone

The time you said you wasn't feeling well

Did you think I couldn't tell

You've been with someone else

You were only kidding yourself


When I first found out I hurt all over

I felt so left out till I got to know her

So I drived away as she got over

And I became just like her so don't be surprised to find

The angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Yes the angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

The angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

Yes the angel in your arms this morning

Is gonna be the devil in someone else's arms tonight

// I Don't Want To Be A One Night Stand //

Now you ask me if I will go with you

Well I'd like to but I don't know if it's right

Are you looking for someone to care for you

Or just someone to love you tonight


Well I don't want to be a one night stand

So if that's what you got planned

Baby before we go you better let me know

I don't want to be a one night stand


It been so long since I've had some loving

And your kisses make me wish that you were mine

Now it'd be so easy for me to fall for you

And let myself have a good time


Well I don't want to be a one night stand

So if that's what you got planned

Baby before we go you better let me know

I don't want to be a one night stand


Well I don't want to be a one night stand

So if that's what you got planned

Baby before we go you better let me know

I don't want to be a one night stand


Well I don't want to be a one night stand

So if that's what you got planned

Baby before we go you better let me know

I don't want to be a one night stand

// I've Waited All My Life For You //

Don't you know

That you're the one

I'd like to live my life through

I can't see anyone with me but you


I want to go where you go

And share the things you do

For I've waited all my life for you

I've heard tales

That true love comes

Only once in a life time

And this time is the last time for me

For I just can't imagine

Being in love with someone new

Cuz I've waited all my life for you


So here it is

All the love

That I've saved for a lifetime

Never touched

Never crushed

And never used

And to think that I'd ever find you

It's impossible but true

Cuz I've waited all my life for you

Oh I just can't imagine

Being in love with someone new

Cuz I've waited all my life for you

// I Was Glad To Give My Everything To You //

Oh I know it's hard for you to say it's over

Well it's twice as hard for me to let you go

Out there I hope you find a softer shoulder

But before you leave there's something you should know


I was glad to give my everything to you

Yeah we almost made our every dream come true

And though we didn't have the chance to see it through

I was glad to give my everything to you


Oh you say you need a little room for breathing

Somehow I guess you know I'd understand

And though you're hurting me

I still can't help in believing

I'd be glad if I could do it all again


I was glad to give my everything to you

Yeah we almost made our every dream come true

And though we didn't have the chance to see it through

I was glad to give my everything to you


Oh I was glad to give my everything to you

// Take Your Love Away //

Do my heart a favor take your love away

Thank you for the offer but I can't let you stay

Everytime that love is given

I've been the one to pay


So save my heart take your love away

Do my heart a favor take your love and run

Lets go our separate way before there's damage done

Oh cuz I'm in no condition to fall for anyone


Save my heart take your heart and run

Take your love and hide away

Take my word that nothing but heartaches will follow if you stay

Take your love away

Every time love was given I've been the one to pay

Save my heart take your love away


Take your love and hide away

Take my word that nothing but heartaches will follow if you stay

Take your love and leave me now

Take a look there's nothing to keep you from breaking me down


Take your love away

// (There's Nothing Like The Love) Between A Woman And A Man //

Some folks say that a mother's love is sweeter than the rest

When her baby's nestled in her arms and feeding at her breast

But I can't explain the feeling when you reach and touch my hand

Because there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man


It's a miracle from heaven

That it fills me through and through

Like a feeling that surrounds us

Touching me touching you

When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand

Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man


Well the father's love is quiet

But it's there for all to see

When a little boy is laughing bouncing on his daddy's knee

Then those great big hands reach down to tuck his little cowboy in

But there's nothing like the love between a woman and a man


It's a miracle from heaven

That it fills me through and through

Like a feeling that surrounds us

Touching me touching you

When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand

Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man


It's a miracle from heaven

That it fills me through and through

Like a feeling that surrounds us

Touching me touching you

When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand

Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man


It's a miracle from heaven

That it fills me through and through

Like a feeling that surrounds us

Touching me touching you

When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand

Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man


It's a miracle from heaven

That it fills me through and through

Like a feeling that surrounds us

Touching me touching you

When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand

Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man

// Why Can't He Be You //

He takes me to the places you and I use to go

He tells me over and over that he loves me so

He gives me love that I never got from you

He loves me too


His love is true

But why can't he be you

He never fails to call and tell me I'm on his mind

And I'm lucky to have such a guy I hear it all the time

And he does all the things that you would never do


He loves me too

His love is true

But why can't he be you

Oh he's not the one who dominates my mind and my soul


And I should love him so cuz he loves me I know

But his kisses leave me cold

He sends me flowers

Calls on the hour

Just to prove his love

And my friends say that when he's around

I'm all he speaks of

And he does all the things that you would never do


He loves me too

His love is true

But why can't he be you

// Invitation To The Blues //

Well I couldn't sleep last night

Just walked the floor

Don't know how I'll stand this anymore

Lonely all the time since I lost you


Received your invitation to the blues

I don't know why you cause me such pain

I just hope I just never go through this much again

Thanks for sending something I can't use

Received your invitation to the blues


You took the laughter from this world of mine

And thanks to you the sun will never shine

I walk the floor so much I wore out my shoes

I received your invitation to the blues

I don't know why you cause me such pain

I just hope I just never go through this much again

Well lonely me I don't know what to do

Received your invitation to the blues

I don't know why you cause me such pain

I just hope I never go though this much again


Thanks for sending something I can't use

Received you invitation to the blues

// Right Time Of The Night //

Sun goes down on a silky day

Quarter moon walking though the Milky Way

Oh you and me baby

We could think of something to do


It's the right time of the night

The stars are waking above

It's the right time of the night for making love


No use talking when the shadows fall

Night bird's calling and he says it all

Oh you and me baby

We could think of something to do


It's the right time of the night

The stars are waking above

It's the right time of the night for making love


I got you and you got me

Tell you that's the way my mama always said it should be

Oh I'll be good and you be kind

We'll be bad if you don't mind


It's the right time of the night

The stars are waking above

It's the right time of the night for making love


It's the right time of the night

The stars are waking above

It's the right time of the night for making love


It's the right time of the night

The stars are waking above

It's the right time of the night for making love
