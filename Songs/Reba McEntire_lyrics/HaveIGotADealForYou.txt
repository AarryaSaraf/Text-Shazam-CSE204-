// I'm In Love All Over //

Well I'm flying out of Tulsa
Trying to get out to the coast
Missing my connections
But it's you I miss the most

I'm in love all over [echo]
I'm in love all over [echo]
Well I'm in love all over
Everywhere I go

Well my heart feels like bursting
When you walk into the room
My lips just start thirsting
For another kiss from you

I'm in love all over [echo]
Yes I'm in love all over [echo]
I'm in love all over
From my head down to my shoes

In search of true affection
I found a new direction
And that's straight to you
Oh I use to like to play around
But I can see that's all over now

Oh my friends sure like to gossip
Think they know the gospel truth
Words leak like a faucet
When it comes to me and you

I'm in love all over [echo]
Oh I'm in love all over [echo]
Yes I'm in love all over
Everywhere I go
I'm in love all over
From my head down to toes
I'm in love all over
Everybody knows about me and you

In search of true affection
I found a new direction
And that's straight to you
Oh I use to like to play around
But I can see that's all over now

Oh my friends sure like to gossip
Think they know the gospel truth
Words leak like a faucet
When it comes to me and you

I'm in love all over [echo]
Oh I'm in love all over [echo]
Yes I'm in love all over
Everywhere I go
I'm in love all over
From my head down to toes
I'm in love all over
Everybody knows about me and you

Oh yes they do
Cause I'm in love all over
I'm in love all over
Yes I'm in love all over
Yes I'm in love all over

// She's Single Again //

I just got to tell you what I saw last night
I wish I was guessing but I know that I'm right
She walked in the place with a smile on her face
And I wondered why she was alone

Every man watched her as she swayed on by
The way she was looking every woman could cry
Then I saw her sit down with a lawyer
And I knew what was going on

She's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend
She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Is this number 4
Is this number 5
How many husbands has she buried alive
She uses the favors that the good Lord gave her
With the devil's desire

Well I bet she's thinking
She's on top of the world
And I've seen her working
So I'm warning you girls
She's single again
She's got a way with men
But she better get away from mine

'Cause she's single again
Hold on to your man
She'll make us worry and cry
And bring us broken lives
And heartaches that never end
She's single again
She's no woman's friend
She's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

Yeah she's making her move
She's got nothing to lose
Oh look out
She's single again

// The Great Divide //

Well I could swear
This king size bed
Keeps getting wider
And I could swear
A stranger's laying by my side
And I can swear a long dark valley lies between us
And there ain't no way to cross the great divide

The great divide
Ain't in Colorado
It's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide
Oh that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild
The bridge we burned
Between our hearts

And Lord knows we both tried hard
At crossing rivers
But pride runs as deep
As it is wide
And the love that once could conquer any mountain
Has reached the edge of the great divide

The great divide
Ain't in Colorado
It's the distance that we've somehow grown apart
The great divide
Oh that river's sorrow
We can't rebuild
The bridge we burned
Between our hearts

The great divide
Ain't in Colorado

// Have I Got A Deal For You //

Well you look like the kind who's got an eye for a bargain
A kind of guy who likes to shop around
Well I got me this old heart
That I'm putting on the market
And I'll make you a deal you can't turn down

Have I got a deal for you
A heart that's almost like brand new
And I'll let it go so cheap
You'll think you stole it 'fore you're through
Have I got a deal for you

Well you could search the whole world over
And never find another like it
It's got a built in lifetime guarantee
It's a one time only offer
And darling once you've tried it
You're gonna fall in love with it you'll see

Have I got a deal for you
A heart that's almost like brand new
And I'll let it go so cheap
You'll think you stole it 'fore you're through
Have I got a deal for you

// Red Roses (Won't Work Now) //

Red roses just won't work now
Here we go us again
You've been gone and here you stand
With a dozen I'm sorry's in your hand

Victim of your podent charms
I took you back with open arms
But along with the roses came the thorns

And that's why red roses just won't work now
Cause you've done too much
To talk things out
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt
Red roses just won't work now

Gone for good's the trust I had
You let me done the garden path
Just too many times to take you back
So faith is why don't you
Save the roses for you know who
I already know how long they'll last

And that's why red roses just won't work now
Cause you've done too much
To talk things out
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt
Red roses just won't work now

// Only In My Mind //

Oh on a park bench in the middle of July
We sat and watched the children play
If it was the heat or the noise
He didn't have too much to say

Then with a move of his eyes
A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget

He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again
Let it be chased away by time
He said have you ever cheated on me
I said only in my mind

How can I tell him
The time we spent together
Was time between friends
There's just somethings I can talk about with you
That I can't just talk with him
How can I tell you
That somewhere in the cards it was meant for us to be
Why am I blushing in front of you now
Is it you or the heat

He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again
Let it be chased away by time
He said have you ever cheated on me
I said only in my mind

Darling have you ever cheated on me
And I said only in my mind

// She's The One Loving You Now //

She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
She's the one loving you now

Well you're only bad crime
Was you used all the right lines
To make a girl like me
Feel like I was one of a kind

You had me believing
What I had you were needing
But I guess there was something missing
That you needed to find

She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
She's the one loving you now

Who says you need a reason
For getting up and leaving
Frustration sets in
Cause I know she holds you tight
I guess it's human nature
To want to find a reason
Cause one good reason would make me
Sleep a little better tonight

She's got what I don't
You there to lean on
I wish I could get that off of my mind
But I don't know how
Cause she don't love you
Anything like I do
But that don't mean anything
She's the one loving you now

Yeah that don't mean anything
Cause she's the one loving you now

// Whose Heartache Is This Anyway //

Don't tell me that time will ease the pain
Don't tell me the sunshines after the rain
Don't sit there and tell me
I'll love again someday
Whose heartache is this anyway

Don't say that all things happen
For the best
And don't talk of silver linings
Don't tell me I'll forget
Don't say don't you worry
Cause everything will be OK
Whose heartache is this anyway

Cause I'm not in the mood for sympathy
At least not from the one who's leaving me
So don't try to make it easy
Don't search for words to say
Whose heartache is this anyway

Well you say that'll always care for me
That I'll always be special
Well that's not what I need
So why don't you just go now
You've done enough today
And whose heartache is this anyway

Cause I'm not in the mood for sympathy
At least not from the one who's leaving me
So don't try to make it easy
Don't search for words to say
Whose heartache is this anyway

Why don't you just go now
You've done enough today
And whose heartache is this anyway

// I Don't Need Nothin' You Ain't Got //

Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy
Or a flat up on park avenue
I don't need riches or treasures
All those high priced pleasures darling
All I need is you

I know I don't need nothing you ain't got
If you were coffee in the morning
Well I'd drink that whole pot
Cause you got everything all them others do not
Darling I don't need nothing you ain't got

Now Lord knows you ain't a saint
Robert Redford you ain't
But you got a heart of gold through and through
And when it comes to loving
All that kissing and hugging
Ain't nobody else ever gonna do

I know I don't need nothing you ain't got
If you were coffee in the morning
Well I'd drink that whole pot
Cause you got everything all them others do not
Darling I don't need nothing you ain't got

Well now who thought I'd be satisfied
With just one guy by my side
Oh Lordy, Lordy look at me
But hon you're different from the rest
I'm here to confess
That love from you is all I'm ever gonna need

Well I don't need a caddy to make me happy
Or a flat up on park avenue
I don't need riches or treasures
All those high priced pleasures darling
All I need is you

I know I don't need nothing you ain't got
If you were coffee in the morning
Well I'd drink that whole pot
Cause you got everything all them others do not
Darling I don't need nothing you ain't got

// Don't Forget Your Way Home //

Now you spread your wings to fly
There are some new things you must try
No matter where it is you go
Oh whoah don't forget your way home

I see the leaving in your eyes
I see no reason I should try
To hold you back
And keep you for my own
Oh whoah don't forget your way home

Many roads may lead you back this way
And you may change your mind someday
And when you've missed this life we've known
Oh whoah don't forget your way home

I guess I'll always feel the same
I'll always be the keeper of this flame
And it will burn long after you're gone
Oh whoah don't forget your way home

Many roads may lead you back this way
And you may change your mind someday
And when you've missed this life we've known
Oh whoah don't forget your way home
