// I'd Say You //

If I had to say what love feels like
I'd say you
If I had to say what love tastes like
I'd say you
If I had to show what love looks like
That's an easy thing to do
I'd pick your favorite colors
And honey I'd paint you

If someone asked what heaven is
I'd say you
If I describe what pleasure is
I'd say you
If I had to show what a dream looks like
That's an easy thing to do
I'd pick your favorite colors
And honey I'd paint you

In Webster's book
I'd even add a word or two
Under perfect lover
I'd put see you

If I had to show my biggest thrill
That's an easy thing to do
I'd pick your favorite colors
And honey I'd paint you

I'd say you
I'd say you

If I had to show what love looks like
That's an easy thing to do
I'd pick your favorite colors
And honey I'd paint you

// Everything I'll Ever Own //

Funny you can hold it in your hand
And never cause you're afraid to play
And you can feel your dreams
Softly slipping through your fingers
Till they're so far away

Sitting there surrounded
By your many life's possessions
Feeling so much more than all the load
You realized you've learned one more
Of living's many lessons
Love's worth more than all you'll ever own

What I'd give if you were here beside me
We could spend forever here alone
Oh what I'd give what would I give
Just that moment
Just everything I'll ever own

Funny when I really had it all
I never knew
Cause I just couldn't see
The wealth I hoped to find
Couldnt even hold a candle
To the love you gave to me

I've taken love for granted
And I've taken love for pleasure
Never taking time to understand
Now I know that loving you
Has been my greatest treasure
And I let it slip right through my hands

What I'd give if you were here beside me
We could spend forever here alone
Oh what I'd give what would I give
Just that moment
Just everything I'll ever own

// What Do You Know About Heartache //

You come to me just as a friend
Cause you're looking for someone's shoulder you can cry on
Well she broke your heart
Now it's the end
And you say that you've got an aching heart
Like the world has never known

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you

You say I may not understand
How it feels to see your love in the arms of another
But you don't know the many times
That I had to hide all my tears inside
When I saw you with your lover

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you

When you don't even know about the love that I feel for you

But baby what do you know about heartache
What do you know about pain
What do you know about the sleepless nights
And walking alone in the rain
What do you know about crying
What do you know about being blue
When you don't even know about the love I feel for you

// Out Of The Blue //

Out of the blue
I needed someone to take me
Out of the blue
It seemed I'd always be alone
Till out of the blue came you

Out of the blue
Waiting for a love to take me
Out of the blue
I thought love had passed me by
Till out of the blue came you

Spreading my wings alone I'd fly
That empty sky of blue
Hoping that I would someday find
That someone just like you

Out of the blue
Someone who's love would take me
Out of the blue
I had almost given up
Till out of the blue came you

I thought love had passed me by
Till out of the blue came you

// Over, Under, And Around //

You've been treating me like a candle
You put me out and light me as you please
But I ain't never gonna be your handle
So you can hold me and hurt me when you squeeze
And bring me to my knees

I got over you long ago
I ain't under your spell
I've been around here too long
I've been over under around and now I'm gone

You carried me away with your blue eyes
Now I'm heading back for those blue skies
You cut me way too hard and way too deep
You're looking at what a fool used to be
Take a look at me

I got over you long ago
I ain't under your spell
I've been around here too long
I've been over under around and now I'm gone

I got over you long ago
I ain't under your spell
I've been around here too long
I've been over under around and now I'm gone

// I'm Not That Lonely Yet //

I don't mind to give you a slow dance or two
I'm sorry I'm not at my best
I know you can see I'm incredibly blue
But I'm not that lonely yet

I look in your eyes while you're dancing with me
And try to fulfill your request
But don't ask for favors when it's time to leave
Cause I'm not that lonely yet

Now don't say you want me
I've heard that before
The words weigh like stones in my head
There may come a time when I'll think of you more
But I'm not that lonely yet

It's nice to be dancing
To waltzes again
And maybe it helps to forget
You've opened the door but I'm not waltzing in
Cause I'm not that lonely yet
No I'm not that lonely yet

// Whoever's Watchin' //

I'm not wasting my time on earthly longing
Let that glory leave me be
I'm just tasting my life story
Just a page in history

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Well I'm not hurting like I used to
I got lucky can't you see
Love came searching
It could choose you
Love's the greatest victory

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

I always look to the sky
And held my head high
Had to be what I had to be
Till the day that I die
Yes I wonder why
Somebody's watching
Watching over me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Well if you know me
You know I've squandered
Everything that's dear to me
Still I stand here in total wonder
How it's all come back to me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me
Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

Whoever's watching
Must be watching over me

// Old Man River (I've Come To Talk Again) //

Cool breeze on the river
Ripples to the shore
Wash away my troubles
To the sea forever more
Wind and willows whisper
Sadness is the sound
Tell the tale of my wants
Happy world that's falling down
Old man I might be going where you're bound

Old man river
I've come to talk again
Yes I know you're tired
Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you
He's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind

I want to travel with you
In your deep and nimble soul
That's the only way to make it
Peaceful like before

We used to touch at midnight
But now I feel he's gone
Even though he's lying next to me I feel alone
Oh man it looks like I'm to travel alone

Old man river
I've come to talk again
Yes I know you're tired
Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you
He's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind

Old man river
I've come to talk again
Yes I know you're tired
Cause your journey never ends
He's just like you
He's moving all the time
And I think he's moving me out of his mind

// You're The First Time I've Thought About Leaving //

I've seen you smile more than I thought you would
And I smiled back a little more than I should
And lately at night while he's sound asleep
I'm thinking things that I shouldn't think

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never done known someone like you

Sometimes I wait when I really should go
Lord only knows what I do that for
When I get home and he holds me close
I try not to think what I'm thinking most

You're the first time I've thought about leaving
And I really don't know what I'll do
You're the first time I've thought about leaving him
I've never done known someone like you

I've never known someone like you

// Can't Even Get The Blues No More //

I walk into the kitchen
The silverware is gone
The furniture is missing
I guess you got it all uhuh
This is where it ought to hurt
Seems like every time you leave me
You try to think of something worse

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues

Well this time ain't no different
The sun's up in the sky
Sitting on the back porch
Clouds are rolling by
Oh this is where it ought to rain
But it doesn't really matter
To me it's all about the same

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues
(You try and hurt me)

I can't even get the blues no more
I try to worry like I did before
And nothing happens when I walk the floor
So what am I supposed to do
I toss and turn but then I fall asleep
I'm going under but it's not too deep
You want to hurt me but it's just no use
I can't even get the blues
