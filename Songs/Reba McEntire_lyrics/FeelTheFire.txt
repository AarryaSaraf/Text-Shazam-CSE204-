// (You Lift Me) Up To Heaven //

Been to Colorado where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life to lift my spirits high
But nothing that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as loving you

Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

I never try to get away on daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places that I've never been before
But if it's not heaven when you're holding me
It's the way that heaven oughta be

Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

And we never leave the ground
Up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes you make my world go round

// Tears On My Pillow //

You don't remember me
Oh but I remember you
Was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
You fill your heart with joy

If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

You, you, you...

// I Don't Think Love Oughta Be That Way //

Oh, I'm feeling so fine and you're looking so good
And I'd like to get together
Oh Lord, I wish we could
But there's someone at home
Who's depending on me
And boy they'd never know it
If I set my passions free

But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie
And I know I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way

You say a precious moment
Is all that it would be
That I'd forget about you
And you'd forget me
Oh I love what you're saying
It's tempting me so
And though I love to hear it
There's no way that I'll let go

But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie
And I know I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way

No But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie
And I know I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way

But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie
And I know I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way

But I don't think love ought to be that way
No I don't think love ought to be that way
I could tell him a lie
And I know I'd get by
But I don't think love ought to be that way

// Long Distance Lover //

Then you call me long distance from Memphis
When they said it was you on the line
I said don't come tomorrow
Cause I won't be here
You'd only be wasting your time

I've been your long distance lover
For far too long
But I'm not here to tell you
Who's right or who's wrong
But I know I once loved you
But somehow it seems
That it's all a part of a dream

So don't call me again in the morning
Cause I won't be changing my mind
And the phone will be ringing in my empty room
I ain't leaving nothing behind

I've been your long distance lover
For far too long
The nights are so lonely
Can't keep holding on
And the miles are like mountains
That hide you from me
And it's all a part of a dream

I've been your long distance lover
For far too long
Can't hold on to feelings
When you're so long gone
It all keeps on a changing
And now it just means
That it's all a part of a dream

// If I Had My Way //

We wouldn't have to meet here
In this dark secluded place
To hide our faces
If I had it my way

You wouldn't have to say goodbye
Then driving home dream up another alibi
If I had it my way

There'd be no more wrong numbers
When I call you on the phone
And she's there
And I wouldn't have to worry
She might find a moonlit strand of my hair
If I had it my way

Love would not be touch and go
We'd lie here in the afterglow
Till the break of day
If I had it my way

You would not keep leaving me
Love would not be misery
You would always stay
If I had it my way

// I Can See Forever In Your Eyes //

Touch me and I feel your fire
Kiss me and the flame rolls higher
Show me all the love you know
Hold me never let me go

I never thought I'd be
Wrapped in the words
Of your sweet, sweet love
But here you are with me
This is what dreams are made of

I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes

Take me in your arms tonight
Love me with all your might
Give me all my heart can hold
Hold me never let me go

Love was mystery
Until you touched me with sweet, sweet love
Now it's so clear to me
This is what love is made of

I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes

I can see forever in your eyes
I can see a love that never dies
When you lay me down I realize
I can see forever in your eyes

// A Poor Man's Roses (Or A Rich Man's Gold) //

I must make up my mind today
What to have what to hold
A poor man's roses
Or a rich man's gold

One's as wealthy as a king in a palace
Though he's calice and cold
He may learn to give his heart for love
Instead of buying it with gold

Then the poor man's roses
And the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss

And yet the hand that brings a rose tonight
Is the hand that I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold

[Repeat Verses #3 and #4]

// My Turn //

Turn out the light
Turn yourself over to me
Turn off the world
Turn my feelings free

Just enjoy the pleasure
For the pleasure pleases me
You've been turning me on all night long
Now it's my turn

You have reached the woman in me
Through the man in you
Let me be that woman
Before the lovin's through

You just turn yourself over to me
While I turn my feelings free
You've been turning me on all night long
Now it's my turn

All night long
I've been driven to your touch
Haven't had time to give
I've been taking so much

I know you want to hold me
But darling you've done enough
You've been turning me on all night long
Now it's my turn

// Look At The One Who's Been Looking At You //

Aren't you tired of looking
For love you never find
Aren't you tired of playing games

With 20/20 vision
How is your heart so blind
It's all you wanted love to be
Is close enough for you to see

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you

I'm standing here just hoping
You're gonna look my way
But you're too busy chasing dreams to see

But when the dreams are faded
There's gonna come a day
That I can give you sweet, sweet love
And all the things you're dreaming of

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you

Look at the one who's been looking at you
Look at the one who's love would be true
You might be surprised
At the love that's shining in her eyes
Look at the one who's so easily found
Look at the one and stop looking around
Look at the one who's been looking at you

// Suddenly There's A Valley //

When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the Earth knows peace with men

When a star hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end

Touched only by the season
Swept clean by the [?] rain
Surveyed by every bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain

When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
