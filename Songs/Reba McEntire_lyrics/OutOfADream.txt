// (I Still Long To Hold You) Now And Then //

I see you now, I think of then

And dwell upon the happiness of way back when

Cause since you said goodbye

The feelings just won't die

And I still long to hold you now and then


A million years have come and gone

And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own

But seeing you today

Took my breath away

And I still long to hold you now and then


Suddenly I felt myself wondering

If you might wanna try it again

And though I wanted so much to hold you

You smiled and shook my hand


So I'll exist on dreams again

On days when we were lovers and not just friends

And even if I find another love in time

I still long to hold you now and then


Oh, I still long to hold you now and then

// Daddy //

My daddy is a rancher

He's wrangled cattle dang near all his life

He also liked to rodeo

He traveled around with four kids and a wife


Well his old ranch is rocky

But his ropes sail smooth for several years

He worked real hard

And roped real good

And tried to get his ranch out in the clear


He didn't want us kids to rodeo

He wanted more out of life for us

Maybe banking, or a lawyer

Or maybe even driving some old bus


Well that's when we took up singing

And his pride grew greater day by day

And I know his eyes grew misty

The night I sang up on the Opry stage


Now his ranch is so much bigger

Then the days when he first started

The grass grows now where none used to be

His roping got him started

Cattle prices made it better

And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear


Five years ago September, he bought more steers and hung up all his ropes

But he often tells the stories about the rodeos he won and cowboy jokes

Well it's funny that the first big roping that he won some thirty years ago

Was the same day that I sang on the stage of the Grand Old Opry show


Now his ranch is so much bigger

Then the days when he first started

The grass grows now where none used to be

His roping got him started

Cattle prices made it better

And he's trying to get his ranch out in the clear


Now he's feeding cattle

Toting hay

And branding the Y.O.

And his hired hand's there to help him

And she also cooks their meals when they get home

They built their ranch together

And listening to the kids sing through the years


Well they worked real hard and roped real good and now they got their ranch

Out in the clear

Because when a family works together

They finally get their ranch out in the clear

Out in the clear

// Last Night, Ev'ry Night //

I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes and try to hide them from the morning sun

I whisper how ya doing and you smile and say so tenderly good morning hun


Last night you made his memory fade a little

You helped me see how love can still be right

I wish you didn't have to leave

If you just knew how much I need

Last night, ev'ry night


I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis

And you mentioned it's an early flight

You start to pack

And while I comb my hair

I stare at you and think about last night


Cause last night you made his memory fade a little

You helped me see how love can still be right

I wish you didn't have to leave

If you just knew how much I need

Last night, ev'ry night


I slip into my robe to go make coffee

You come in and pull me close to you

And as I feel your tender kiss

I whisper can't Memphis wait a day or two

Cause last night you made his memory fade a little

You helped me see how love can still be right

I wish you didn't have to leave

If you just knew how much I need

Last night, ev'ry night


Cause last night you made his memory fade a little

You helped me see how love can still be right

I wish you didn't have to leave

If you just knew how much I need

Last night, ev'ry night

// Make Me Feel Like A Woman Wants To Feel //

Open up your arms to me

Come and hold me tenderly

Let me know your love for me is real

And love me like there's no tomorrow

Share my joys and share my sorrow

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel


I know you love me cause you told me so

But that ain't enough cause I want to be shown

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel

And let me know you miss me when I'm not around

Go ahead and kiss me when I'm feeling down

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel


I know you love me cause you told me so

But that ain't enough cause I want to be shown

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel

And let me know you miss me when I'm not around

Go ahead and kiss me when I'm feeling down

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel


Love me like I want to be loved

Let me know I'm the one you dream of

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel

Make me feel like a woman wants to feel

// That Makes Two Of Us //

So you like Sunday picnics

And yelling at the umpire at a baseball game

Window shopping, popcorn popping

Wading through the puddle in a summer rain

And I'll bet you're kind to children and

Someday you'd like to be a mother too

And do you got a feeling when you're with me the way I do


Well that makes two of us

We're like birds of a feather

True love brings together

A precious few of us

That makes two of us


So you believe in wishes

While blowing out the candles on a birthday cake

Gentle hugs and lightning bugs

Staying up all night to watch the morning break

We've got so much in common

Given half a chance I'm sure you'll agree

One way to sum up forever is you and me


Well that makes two of us

We're like birds of a feather

True love brings together

A precious few of us

That makes two of us

// Sweet Dreams //

Sweet Dreams of you

Every night I go through

Why can't I forget you

And start my life new

Instead of having sweet dreams about you


You don't love me

It's plain

I should have known

I'd never wear your ring

I should hate you

The whole night through

Instead of having sweet dreams about you


Why can't I forget the past

And start loving someone new

Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Instead of having sweet dreams about you

// I'm A Woman //

Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks

And have 'em on the line

You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts

'Fore you can count from one to nine

I can slip up a great big dip up of lard from a drippings can

Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping, and be back before it melts in

the pan


Cause I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N

Let me tell ya again

I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N


Well I can rub and scrub till this house shines just like a dime

Feed the baby

Grease the car

Powder my nose at the same time


You know I can get all dressed up

Go out swinging with the M-A-N

Jump in bed at five

Sleep till 6

And start all over again


Cause I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N

Let me tell ya again

I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N


Well now if you come to me sick you know that I'm gonna make you well

And if you come to me all hexed up you know I'm gonna break the spell

And if you come to me hungry, you know

I'll feed ya full of my grits

And if it's loving you want, I can kiss you and give you the shivering fits


Cause I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N

Let me tell ya again

I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N

(I'll say it again)


Well, I got a twenty dollar gold fee that says there's nothing that I can't do

Well I can make a dress out of feeding sacks and I can make a man out of you


Cause I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N

Let me tell ya again

I'm a woman

W-O-M-A-N


I'm a woman

I'm a woman

I'm a woman

Yeah I'm a woman

// Rain Fallin' //

Rain Fallin,Fallin Rain

It's a long and troubled night

A night when I wish I could sleep

But there's no sleep inside


Heart Breaking, Breaking heart

It's such a lonely sound

That cries for the need of someone

But there's no one around


Nobody here to hold

No one to warm the cold

That lies deep within my soul

All around, just the sound of the

Rain Falling, Fallin Rain

Like gentle tears of pain

That comes with my only friend

It's the gently falling rain


Nobody here to hold

No one to warm the cold

That lies deep within my soul

All around, just the sound of the

Rain Falling, Fallin Rain

Like gentle tears of pain

That comes with my only friend

It's the gently falling rain

// Runaway Heart //

I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart

Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love

In his runaway heart


He's a fast rushing river I can't get across

Like an ocean of sadness, o'er which I am tossed

He never slows down, he's always ready to fly

And when I get next to you it's just hello

Hello and goodbye


I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart

Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love

In his runaway heart


No rope can hold down

He's not fit to be tied

Like the wildest of horses

Nobody can ride


Freedom's his distance

And the means to his end

So I'm giving up trying

Cause I'm just chasing, chasing the wind


I'm rolling I'm tumbling, I'm falling apart

Cause I'll never, no I'll never find love

In his runaway heart


In his runaway heart

// It's Gotta Be Love //

It's gotta be love

That keeps us together

It's gotta be a feeling from the heart

It's gotta be love

It must last forever

Or I won't let the fire start

It's gotta be love


I don't have time for a part time love affair

I can't pretend it's love when it's not really there

So don't you lead me on if you don't really care

It's gotta be real

And I got a feeling


It's gotta be love

That keeps us together

It's gotta be a feeling from the heart

It's gotta be love

It must last forever

Or I won't let the fire start

It's gotta be love


I can't just let you take my love and walk away

And you must know that love is not a game I play

So when you say you love me

You better mean just what you say


It's gotta be real

And I got a feeling


It's gotta be love

That keeps us together

It's gotta be a feeling from the heart

It's gotta be love

It must last forever

Or I won't let the fire start

It's gotta be love


It's gotta be love

That keeps us together

It's gotta be a feeling from the heart

It's gotta be love

It must last forever

Or I won't let the fire start

It's gotta be love
