Album: HailToTheThief

// 2 + 2 = 5 //

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes up five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes up five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because you have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

Oh

I try to sing along
I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I swat em like flies
But like flies the buggers keep coming back
But I'm not
Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the dock
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king that the sky is falling in
When it's not
When it's not
When it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not

// Sit Down, Stand Up //

Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell (stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)

Sit down, stand up
Sit down

Hey, we can wipe you out anytime (stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down)
Anytime
Anytime

Stand up
Sit down

The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops

The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops

The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops

// Sail To The Moon //

I sailed the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars

Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon

Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

// Backdrifts //

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting

This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

Uh, uh, uh!

You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

You fell into our, you fell into our

We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

// Go To Sleep //

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body

Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body

I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe 'round, tie him down

May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

// Where I End And You Begin //

There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

4, 5, 6, 7
(Get to heaven)

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

// We Suck Young Blood //

Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

We want the young blood

Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?

We suck young blood
We suck young blood

Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

// The Gloaming //

Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha-ha, funny how

When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming

// There There //

In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there

There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)
(Don't reach out, don't reach out)

Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder)
(Someone on your shoulder)

There, there

Why so green and lonely?
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me

We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

// I Will //

I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up

Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes, eyes eyes

// A Punchup At A Wedding //

No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no
No no no no no no

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight

You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

Hypocrite, opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round, you stay frozen to the spot

The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah

No no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

// Myxomatosis //

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive

My thoughts are misguided and a little naÃ¯ve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

// Scatterbrain //

I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill

Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range

Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain

// A Wolf At The Door //

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops

No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no

Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know we're born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish you'd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off

I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone, tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna

// Paperbag Writer //

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone
It was nice when it lasted but now it's gone

Blow into this paper bag

Take your armour off, you're not under attack
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Come on, come on

Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone
Blow into this paper bag
Go home and stop grinning at everyone

Like they were honeybees or a plague of rats
Take your armour off, you're not under attack

Blow into this paper bag
Blow into this paper bag

// Fog (Again) //

There's a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done, how?

How did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

Goodnight, everybody
Thank you

// Gagging Order //

I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say

Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off

Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, blood pouring down the street
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

Move along

// I Am A Wicked Child //

One, two, three, four

Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I've sinned and I am so confused
And I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

I am the devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk a crooked mile
Yet I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow
If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow, and not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart

Now I wake up in the night
It's tugging at my arms and legs like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus to radiate his light
To radiate his light
