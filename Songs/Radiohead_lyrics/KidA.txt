// Everything In Its Right Place //

(Kid A, Kid A)
(Kid A, Kid A)

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say, tried to say
Tried to say, tried to say

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything

// Kid A //

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie

We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists
We've got heads on sticks
And you've got ventriloquists

Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed

The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids

// The National Anthem //

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on

Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on

Smile

// How To Disappear Completely //

That there, that's not me

I go where I please

I walk through walls

I float down the Liffey


I'm not here

This isn't happening

I'm not here, I'm not here


In a little while

I'll be gone

The moment's already passed

Yeah, it's gone


I'm not here

This isn't happening

I'm not here, I'm not here


Strobe lights and blown speakers

Fireworks and hurricanes


I'm not here

This isn't happening

I'm not here, I'm not here....

// Optimistic //

Flies are buzzing 'round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough

I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship

You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
Dinosaurs roaming the earth

// In Limbo //

Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
I got a message I can't read
Another message I can't read

I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world

I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way

You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
The most beautiful woman in the world

Come back
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Another message I can't read
Come back

// Idioteque //

Who's in the bunker? Who's in the bunker?
Women and children first, and the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst, until I burst, until I
Who's in the bunker? Who's in the bunker?
I have seen too much, you haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first, and children first, and children

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me hear both
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Throw him in the fire, throw him in the fire, throw him on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening, happening
Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
Take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money

Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

// Morning Bell //

The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round

Cut the kids in half 
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a friend
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking 
Walking, walking, walking, walking
Walking, walking, walking, walking

// Motion Picture Soundtrack //

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies

I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe

I will see you in the next life

[Early version has a second verse:]

Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I can't even recognize you

I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 
I think you're crazy, maybe 

I will see you in the next life
