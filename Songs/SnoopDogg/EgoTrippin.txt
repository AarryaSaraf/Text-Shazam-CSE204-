// Cool //

I got a penthouse in Manhattan 
Two more in Malibu 
I bought an 87 Cadillac Seville 
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers 
A couple on my toes,
I wear the finest cologne money can buy
It keeps me smellinâ like a rose
If u wonderinâ how I do it
Thereâs just one simple rule...Iâm just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...Iâm just cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me

whatâs the spell? (C-O-O-L)
I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakinâ place I want to
And my lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just aint nobody better 
Heaven knows that Iâm the one
Its all because of something
That I didnât learn in school,
Im just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...Iâm soo cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me
