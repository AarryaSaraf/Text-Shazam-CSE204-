// Aftermath (The Intro) //

This is dedicated to the niggas that was down from day one
Welcome to the aftermath
(Like we always do about this time)

Welcome to the aftermath!

The aftermath, a second growth, the period immediately following an unusual event
This is brought to you by the makers of funky music
Coming directly to you from the Soul Kitchen
So let's get deep
You ask how deep is deep?
Can I ask you how deep would you like to get?

The aftermath brings to you some of the best hip-hop and R&B on the planet

We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're coming we're coming we're coming
We're here!

Watch yourself, peep the blow up
From state-to-state we're touching home no matter what sign you throw up
Wait, we're on some other while you're still slipping
Bringing you all banging speakers for sparks fly out the car system
Off the tops, snatching props and the proper the tops we touch
We're hard to knock, we got it locked
From every angle of music the different sound view
R&B, rap, whatever flavor kid it's all new
So let's say we bring it with the east and the west!
The final results: the aftermath touching every coast!
So when the bar blows then the DJ spins
And we don't set trip, we set trends
Love to the artists, in fact they be the smartest if they business is tight
'Cause keep it real means moving the cash markets
And constantly building and stop destroying everything that we touch
And leave something for our children

Whatever it takes to get you paid yeah-yeah-yeah, keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, keep on doing it
And whatever it is that gets you free yeah-yeah-yeah
(Gets you free, yeah) keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, hey keep on doing it
Whatever it takes to get you paid yeah-yeah-yeah
(Whatever it is) keep on doing it
You gotta keep doing it, keep on, keep on yeah
And whatever it is that gets you free yeah-yeah-yeah
(Whatever it is that gets you free, yeah) keep on doing it
Keep on doing it, oh yeah oh-I

You gotta-you gotta keep on doing it, doing it, doing it
Aftermath is gonna keep on doing it, doing it, doing it, yeah

Anybody killer!

// East Coast/West Coast Killas //

East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer

While childish MCs battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeed-y, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyota driven
True and living driving with the gat
Uh, pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diesel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic

East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer
East-coast killer, west-coast killer

Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin their career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nut sack yo I stay focused
Beefing without skills seeking will only weaken
The artist speaking over beats and, you be cheating
Cacophony of small talent rappers, claiming a coast
Over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopping ya correctly
Ignorant ass MCs continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cell block
Too many MCs rapping causing lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voice box
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be using
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
What you think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid!

East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 

Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constitutional rights have been suspended

The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast tripping going on through out the business
East-coast west-coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'mma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killing in the high rise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringing the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill

Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!

East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 
East-coast killer, west-coast killer 

Now when I bomb like Saddam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, emerging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatching hoes up, my flow's up
When the fucking world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, fronting like you down for the real
To make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal
Like Henry Hill (kill that noise!) but what's the fucking deal?

East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 
East-coast killer west-coast killer 

East-coast, west-coast, kill that noise!

// Shittin' On The World //

Yes yes y'all, ooh funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh, in come funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy it's the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh notes come wrong

Dre is chilling, Ruff is chilling
What more can I say? (Let's make a million)
M-E-L-Man, niggas call me Most
I be rocking on the East and the West Coast
Your mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline
With Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins
This shit be on my mind like O'Donnells interceptions
How would I look with Mike's complexion
Eat me, freak me, take your hand and beat me
All I wanna say is I don't really give a fuck
Cause Most he be mega
Copped the PlayStation but still play the Sega
And in the PJs I DJ and blow amps
Bad as Shrimp Scampi with the food stamps
Huh, I'm not a stranger to danger
On the streets I be known as the jaw re-arranger
Heavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule
White boys say it now "Cool, cool, cool!"
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk
In the SP or the MV, see three G
Hoes see me coming in 3-D
I spread Lizzy with ten mates
Hit the skins and I break out like an inmate
Hey yo, that's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shitting on it

(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)

I warm it up like humidity
Mel (Man), okay I'm here till infinity
My shit be outta... space with the Ewoks
This is my planet but I never wear the Reeboks
When we rock to the beat of a cappella
Most reigns supreme, niggas grab your umbrellas
It's time to bounce so where the player, mate?
Jealous MC's still drinking on that Hatorrade
Bitches flirting with the giggles and chuckles
You'll never get the jizzy bare knuckle
'Cause I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it
Hold up! Back to the clinic
Uh, ah, poked your bitch in the eye
Then I step like Omega Psi Phi (awroof!)
I walk the earth like Moses
Any mackadocious, I grew up with roaches
Shows, I turn out
I got dough but still call my hoes on my burnout
But can't phone long distance
I'm a rich nigga still getting public assistance
Rocking shit on a task cam
Got MCs talking 'bout "I love you, man"
But you can't get my last bud
Or my last dove, outta beats we be making
Dre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quaking
That's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shitting on it

(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)
(On the world) Shitting on it
(On the world) Shitting on the world
(Here me, yeah, shitting on the world)

Yes yes y'all, ooh funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol' schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh, in come funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
Every three days and the El change [?]
Ooh, Most come funk

(Blunt time pull out your Philly)

Thought they were moving in and now they wanna cut us wrong
Room for moving in, but that was only mine
They will shake the hand, never really seen and only heard
They will shake the hand, he is only to heard long
Knick-knack, paddy wack give a dog a bone
Long Beach City I wreck is my zone

Fool now break for ya two
It's called the old Rambo, catch ambush
I wish you wouldn't moosh like ya wanna come push

Long Beach City firmly represented
Narrator X is representer
Lyrical the kick make me ya mentor
Freeze MCs, don't enter
I'll take like Anne Arden's new chips in wintor
Or since I'm Sun I'll melt the metaphor
The metaphors are melting, style is belting
I heard a dog yelping but no helping

Blunt time pull out your Philly
Sip a glass of 'gnac, reload your nine milli
Dancing, puffin, sipping or set tripping
Dimes keep on flipping flipping

// Been There, Done That //

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryna stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collecting my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listening to your demo in the stretch limo
Is how I ride, cartel style, vaults stacked to the max now
A million dollar style, niggas wonder how
"Dre Day" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with more chips than Frito Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothing flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, cause

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

Young black Rockefeller, hella Swiss and mozzarella
Pockets sweller, getting money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Cause most niggas erase hoes that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, making dough by the caseloads
I'mma keep building, make a killing
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at, you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run 'vettes
I'm living on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
And watch niggas start plotting, bitches start to stare
Cause game is money, and money is game
And broke niggas make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grinding, diamonds shining, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass and bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts, cause

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth

A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit 'cause that's all they're worth

Uh, yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
That's right, ha
All these people out talking about who they are, what they got
Heh, it don't even matter
Been there, done that
As long as you true to yourself, gotta be true to yourself
I was always told
If you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything, ha ha
Yeah, that's right!
The Aftermath, beating up on your eardrums
Heh, gotta say what's sup to King Tee, and my man Nation owl
They up in here, gotta say what's up to Chris the Glove
G-L-O-V-E, ha ha
Yeah, that's how it goes down, ha ha, yeah, ah
This is how we coming, heh, yeah
This is how we coming y'all - you know what? Huh

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth

// Choices //

Ah yeah
Ah, ah
Ah yeah

Time and time again
Through our relationship
I've wondered what's going wrong
To make us go through, such pains and heartache
But still I know
That my love is so strong for you

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

I don't understand
Why you wanna take me through these changes
No no
Oh
I can't decide
What to do when it comes to me and you
Because my love is true
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Where do we go from here?
(Where do we go?)
I can't help but wonder
(I can't help it baby)
Do we belong together?
The love I feel can't be alive

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

All alone
I don't wanna lose your love
On my own
Just can't be without you baby, no
Wanna be
Gotta have you in my life
Can't you see
We can make it if we try

[Repeat until fade:]
Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices
Oh, oh, baby
So many reasons why
For me to have you near me
So many choices

As the world keeps turning
Chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon
These niggas are determined

I flow like CDs in the deck
Moosh fools in the face that lack respect
Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk
I deodorize the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G
So leave me alone I'm in the zone
Walking the streets on my own, nigga get blown
Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone
But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone
Are you gone bust or play bones?
You motherfuckin' clone, get off that nigga's style and get you own
It's Miscellane and it's on again
For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step
And kept ya big fuckin' mouth shut

As the world keeps turning
Chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon
These niggas are determined

I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache
Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong
My world is gone like disco
Blowing up Cisco and in my Cammo
Standing in back of me was my soul
Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold
A tar can of hoes to lubricate my system quick
Shaky bitches off the dick
'Cause she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools
Show me the one talking shit so I can drop a fool
I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr Cream
Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G
I really dream of getting mine now let me tell you what's silly
Me, bucking with my team is murder one
I heard a gun busting shots (shots!), down the block (block!)
I guess a nigga getting what he got (got!)
Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call
To a trick that didn't even care
'Cause she was getting fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there
Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga)
Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga)
You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real)
Shit is for real

As the world keeps turning
Chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon
These niggas are determined

I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper
And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes
Let's take it back to the first side
When you was a new jack and jocking my new track
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long
Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard
With a teenage group I'm turning loots to tracks
Me and my niggas like
(These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight lyrics)
You wanna know what the hoes used to do
When me and my crew came busting through
All sorts of blushings brew
(A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew)
Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue
This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front
I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on
Miscellane packing shows like Farrakhan
Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau
Now that's three times your tightest flow
And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack
Three times is clever (buck!)

As the world keeps turning
Chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon
These niggas are determined

As the world keeps turning
Chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon
These niggas are determined

Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt
Barely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt
To art in hell, where the next man dwells
The place with stinking pussy and crack rock dwells

// Got Me Open //

Ai Aiyo Butter is, uh, Hands-On in the house
Well check it out, put some shit on for em
Let's get it on, kick it
Ha yeah, hell yeah
Yeah that shit sounds dope
Aiyo Kim, what you got to say

Well boy you're moving me
There's something physical about it
The way you're making me feel
The way you're touching me, can't explain
Oh, I just can't keep still
When you're kissing me it gives me what I need
Hold on tight and baby do it all night (Check it)
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
I wonder how boy, you make me over

Now tell me away, 'cause I can't stop from how you mean
The things you do to me
Has got my body wanting you more and more
Oh baby, it's got it bad
Your love has got me open

Yeah
No question, kick back, watch my dope eye rise
Still an everyday brother with my eyes on the prize
Take my time analysing every song that dies
Flossing the fliest rides from hits you memorise
Been doing this since days of N.W.A
Took it to the next level when I use to DJ
Got family and fans from New York to L.A
They keep it real 'cause they know that Dre come with Bombay
G's up, ain't nothing changed, yo freeze up!
When I come throat, player haters, women one-two
The dotted Maxwell from only a minimum of set sales
Clutch your tails for honeys waiting to exhale
Keep writing 'til the next millennium
Tape one hit when I serve these fiends, stuff mo' potent than Bolivian
Welcome to the Aftermath
Aiyo Crystal, what you got to say?

It's like I'm glowing about the animal attraction
That grows between us
And then my friends ask me just where the hell I've been
They think I'm crazy, they don't understand
When you're next to me, I'm lost in ecstasy
Don't let go 'cause I'm about to explode (Aftermath!)
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
Baby please don't make me over

Now tell me away, 'cause I can't stop from how you mean
The things you do to me
Has got my body wanting you more and more
Oh baby, it's got it bad
Your love has got me open

You touch me at the spot
Ooh boy, you got me high (that's right)
And when you're loving me down, I never want you to stop
Just take it easy (say what?)
Baby boy, you babe, you touch the spot
I swear you got me open

Now tell me away, 'cause I can't stop from how you mean
The things you do to me
Has got my body wanting you more and more
Oh baby, it's got it bad
Your love has got me open

// Str-8 Gone //

Ha
Woo

Dedicated to the Hub City
Straight West Coast nigga, ain't no pity
Put holes in niggas, real pretty
Real shitty like a black Frank Nitty
I give drugs to the thugs price-free
Handed down the game by that nigga Ice-T
No doubt players like me
Recognise the great King Tee, about twenty grand a ki
Ah, that's that G shit, no doubt about that
Statutory lyrics is how I rape the rap
And get your niggas off my back
And no, God, ya don't pull a strap, 'cause [*gun shot*] fuck that!
I'm very precise when I shoot
Straight out the roof of my Lexus coupe
Ya wanna blame Tha Alkaholik group
But, naw, that nigga Tela must've hit the loot
'Cause he's acting real loonie
And I don't give a fuck cause I'm drunk and I'm a G like Spoonie
The hood rats wanna do me
So if you've got your county cheque give it to me

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, a 50 gat to your dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Huh, so I guess I earned the title 'OG'
Been down for ten years, this my fifth LP
I'mma give this one to Eazy-E
A real motherfucking G, R.I.P
Now all these fools talking 'bout they some killers
Car stealers, big time drug dealers
Bitch ass niggas keep it real, don't lie
You ain't killing shit and they gon' let shit die
You ask "Who the hell am I?"
They call me 'Big Bone' and on my worst night I fades em all
And I come throat ya hood like a locc ass G
Rip any fool that calls hisself an MC
It's only one way, let's have gun play
I make it play, nigga, fuck what you got to say
I got a mad crew of murderers, ex-burglars
Putting soft niggas outta service

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, all the fucking chips blown
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone
Baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, sitting on chrome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

My whole crew lives illegal
Strapped with the bulletproof vest in the front and back Regal
Smoking that sticky green grass
Hitting switches, bumping on cuts from the past
We smoke leaf 'cause we live like Gs
Super-soft niggas become enemies
I hit a lick on the East for ten kis
Now everything I drive is on Deez
I'mma make you believe, I gotta put it down like a real nigga should
My dope spot in every nigga's hood
I don't waste time, I need to get what's mine
Fourteen shells from behind
Leave you in the blind, str-8 paralysed from ya spine
A partner of organised crime
Ya hear it all the time but now ya gotta hear it from the truth
'Til my nigga Karl Phat's respect due

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

Now baby, don't trip, it's King Tee with the gangster shit
Ain't fucking with nothing but them platinum hits
And the two dog groan, 50 gat to the dome
That nigga on the mic str-8 gone

And I'm gone

Would ever be the one to find
A special lady that'll make me do for love

You make me do for love

Cause every day my love
You got me wanting you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh

Oh no man can recognize
The love that's in the sky

Then one day it dawned on me
I had changed completely
I don't know just how it happened
But I love the way you make me do for love

You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me missing you

// No Second Chance //

I got you mad at me
And it's so sad to plea
For you to come back to me
So

And keep being this 'g'
God had going for me
'Cause you
Don't even see
The real me
So fuck all you faggot who believe in hip hop
You'all
Gonna drop like the cop
I'm 'a kill in the parking lot
That shot at me while I was
Robbing that shop
See my middle finger
Well watch it linger
As I flip you the
Bird and know I'm cumming after you
In this stolen luxury sedan with my two
Glocks in each one of my hands

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

I'm 'a state that this is my fate
To hate and rate you as the bait
And make you
Late
With a 'lil' 'g' like me
Can't you see
You'll never be me
And never have a
Life like me
And never be right like me
'Cause you ain't even half way to being a
Motherfucking 'g' like me
Now I'm 'a count to three 'til I blast your brains
Out...one...two...three
I told you I give out no second chance and
If your motherfucking friends wanna starts their chants and have a blue then I
Will kill 'em and make there families watch 'em few
So then they will go on and
Sue
And watch me swearing at you
And screaming "I don't give a fuck it's only
You"
So you better watch out for when Dr. Kevorkian performs an autopsy on you
While you scream I'm still alive and I sit there laughing with my nine wives

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife
You can grab and murder you wife
Live without fear and give no second chance to any one
Then go on and murder the rest of your peers
Like they were deers
Give 'em no
Second chance

So fuck life
Smoke your pipe
Grab the sharpest knife

// L.A.W. (Lyrical Assault Weapon) //

It's like, it's like this
Word up, know what I'm saying? One time for your mind, you know I'm saying?
Yo, from upstate to Brooklyn, the whole borough's thorough
You know the time, you know I'm saying?
Crown Heights, to all my niggas holding it down
It's hardcore, B-boy rhymes just for you, you know I'm saying?
(L-A-W, this might trouble you) This is Sharief, you know I'm saying?
Putting it down for the Aftermath like this

As I inhale the blunt and take a sip off the yac
My rhymes come to life, my verbal forces attack
Can't hold me back, I'm too strong, I waited too long
Freestyle a whole rap tape then write a new song
Been in the game since...what? That shit is past tense
Pass the microphone and watch this nigga crack the C
With that ill shit, I came to kill shit
I crack the code, must be the reason they reveal shit
But in this era of mayhem
I recyc' the murderous rhymes to slay them
To all my opponents who wanna kick it, I spark
The verbal scientist in your title, I'm walking with it
A hundred dime pieces and the party got the heaters
I shine my verbal styles and got niggas climbing on speakers, the thrill
Seekers
An earthquake of bass lines swinging the party, I'm slinging the mic
Like a syllable shotty, sipping 40's

Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals

Bona fide B-boy, biceps' bionic
Blast em back, okay let's get it started
Original rap styles coming from my shooter
Fifty niggas deep, I'm the ill kid recruiter
People gather round, check my flow
Listen too, look take a peek, time for thought then you know (What they know?)
I build with skill, fulfill the drill and still then kill
You couldn't stop the pain with Benadryl
Too many claim unnamed for fame
Or be soft as baby tissue with no gun to aim
I take a raptor's rough cause I'll date the semen
Spectators be saying they can't go where he went
That's another level of attack (ha), bring your bats
My DJ scratch the record like a scrotum sack
I slice the rapper like a surgeon
If he wanna battle, I play him out like a priest in a turban
Too much tenacity, vocal capacity
Ya better take some notes, don't try to get on after me
Cause I'm the chemical enemical
Rhymes I say are definitely guaranteed to reach the pinnacle

Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real players and all the fly girls
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real players and all the fly girls

Feeling the metronome click, my microphone's on
It's time to kiss Sharief to perform
Ya lukewarm, my degrees be uncharted in the centre of fight square
I rum brass knuckle rhymes fucking with crimes
I'm natural as loaded dice, understand
Where no man survives, L.A.W. can
Transform, I see it ain't even worth ya triggers
I'm from the days when B-boys were straight earthing niggas
Standing my arms crossed, toss a grenade
Rein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade
You better cause your dome piece blown
Release chrome beats, nuclear missiles rhymes under my comb
Three strikes marks the villain busting rhymes
Like shots in Sarajevo Saturday night blood be spilling
Some I slaughter such as [?] blows
Crush your corny kids caught stumbling on my shells, so
Sick, too quick, I stab you with some shit
Doing infinite assault these hard lyrics I commit
When I crush your lungs, I keep my pace up-tempo
Swinging my prison rhymes, fucking mics like a nympho

Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real hustlers across the world
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the lyrical assault weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real hustlers across the world

// Nationowl //

All right, is everybody ready (yeah!)
Alright now, here we go

Nationowl divides this bomb to blow
Adios serials worldwide
Once inside ya ride, using the mic like a screwdriver
To break down the speed
While labels were sound asleep, Nowl peeped and creeped
And stole the ground beneath they feet
Far from the bail, still making my sales
Moving tapes like weight, we's hip-hop cartel
Taking over, no doubt
Like thongs, they ass out but win amounts with the Doctor
Dre, all day cash his cheques
Like Play, I hitting you in the head like strays (buu-yu-kow!)
Nationowl's defence covers my ass
And team o' outcast niggas who're quick to blast
Our beat's on hit, keep the peace on
MC's couldn't find my path (Where you at niggas?)

Pledge allegiance to my team
Let's scheme, nigga, we gots ta get CREAM
Cause worldwide shit's outta control
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Young and old, my niggas who's on parole
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Bitches who own, my niggas whose heart is cold
Why you can't get down with Nationowl

Nationowl's anthem, got you soul on lock
Still fully loaded, cocked the handgun
Composed like the Phantom
While the face of earth gets ugly, we ever lovely
Bitches who never duck me, "Nowl loved me"
In thinking I must spend dough til I'm dizzy
Assholes around like a Frisbee
And for satisfaction chew an MC like Wrigley
History's about to be made, I met you in a way
Trying ya hardest to delay
My flight battering, keep the world ringing like Sadaran
Lyrics bone shattering
Pretenders wanting to be Cinderella
What? That shoe you trying to wears, not fitting
Now we're stripping niggas like a Chippendale
I'm ripping hell, burning the devil and inhale

Pledge allegiance to my team
Let's scheme, nigga, we gots ta get CREAM
Cause worldwide shit's outta control
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Young and old, my niggas who's on parole
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Bitches who own, my niggas whose heart is cold
Why you can't get down with Nationowl

In the last days, which side will you be on?
Nationowl's on the side that I beat on
I demand put me on
From the door I use MCs to wipe my feet on
My shit be bumping like in-grown hair
For twenty-six years trained in ghetto warfare
Nigga, I see more green than St. Patrick
Pro actors, game of life with no practice
Controlling craps like I had a remote
It's a rule, now go enter ya tomb
No joke, much over I scold
It's some game for all who's trying to split ya coats
Best believe that these are our last years
Prepare or get done from the rear
As we move there, where? The final frontier
United we stand, divided we don't have a prayer

Pledge allegiance to my team
Let's scheme, nigga, we gots to get cream
Cause worldwide shit's outta control
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Young and old, my niggas who's on parole
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Bitches who own, my niggas whose heart is cold
Why you can't get down with Nationowl

// Fame //

Fame, I'm the man that takes things over
Fame makes me loose, hard to swallow
Fame puts me there where things are hollow
Fame

Fame
It's not your brain, it's just the flame
The bitch is gonna get your ends
Slain!

(You know I need the money, I will get the money
Cause I need the cash, hey c'mon gotta get it)
(You know I need the money, I will get the money

I'ma lemme hit you from be-hind
Fame, fame

Fame
A bullet for me, I bust it for you
I love it when you grab my gun
Fame
Fame, what's your name? What's your name? What's your name?
Say my name? Say my name? Say my name?

The world's famous, rugged with the superstar persona
Rough designer, the chubby alcoholic rhymer
Big timer, I'm known in places I haven't even been
Executed styles behind men
Oh God, I preach that old Hudd City gospel
My look's hostile, hitting Remy from the bottle
The fame is like I'm possessed with game
And everywhere I go, hos screaming my name
But I'm rolling, not that my bald head's swollen
I'm towing, ya fixed up, they'd rather see ya broken
I'm scoping often where the spotlights shine
Me and my crew drinking trying to have a good time
But folks watching, wearing khakis or Versace
They try to mack me, caught up in the paparazzi
I'ma look what the hogg had become
A top notch nigga with the fame game

Is it any wonder, I'll reject ya first
Fame fame fame fame
Is it any wonder, your heart's too cold to fool
Fame fame fame fame
