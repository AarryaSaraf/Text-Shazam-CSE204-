Don't look too hard
Might hurt ya'self
Known to give the color red the blues

Ooh shit, I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket
(Keep up)
So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket
(Keep up)
Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking

Second verse for the hustlas (hustlas)

Spend your money like money ain't shit (Whoop, whoop)

Got to blame it on Jesus
Hashtag blessed

I'm a dangerous man with some money in my pocket

So many pretty girls around me and they waking up the rocket

Why you mad? Fix ya face
Ain't my fault y'all be jocking

24 karat magic in the air
Head to toe so player
Uh, look out!

// Again //

Hands over my head thinkin' what else could go wrong
Woulda stayed in bed, how can a day be so long

Never believed that things happen for a reason,
But how this turned out removed all my doubt so believe
That for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you,
So I'd do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out removed all my doubt
So believe that for you I'd do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you so I'd do it all over again

Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong could turn out so lovely
Yea, I'm so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldn't change a thing
Yea, yea
I'm a do it
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again

Do it all over again
I'd do it all over again
I'd do all over again for you
All I went through led me to you
So I'd do it all over again for you

Whoever thought a day gone so wrong could turn out so lovely [x2]

// All About You //

[Verse 1:]
I know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I'm usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know

I must admit I've felt this way for more than quite a while
But I can't hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Can't wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

Oooh

[Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I'm a fool for speaking up but I don't mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do

And the look that you are givin' me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I'll change my ways I'll
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothin' to lose
I've got nothin' to lose

[Chorus:]
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

[Bridge:]
Girl when you smile
Not a place I'd rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you'll see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That's why I have to take this time baby to tell ya
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

[Chorus:]
Girl, to tell you the truth
It's always been you
I'm all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It's always been you
I'm all about you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm all about you girl
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

// All She Knows //

Once again you're home alone
Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby

Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

You've been livin this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one your looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see

Everyday same old things
So used to feelin pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends

She knows better but
She can't help it
Wanna tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

// Dance In The Mirror //

[Verse 1]
She wakes up in the morning 
Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion 
While she's wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club 
The way she's showing off to her reflection

But she don't know

Is when she dance in the mirror (dance in the mirror)

Of our plans keep you right where you stand
Just wind up seeing you dance

// Don't Give Up //

When you wanna do something thatâs new.
And it seems really, really hard to do.
You feel like quitting, you feel youâre through.
Well I have some advice for you

Donât give up, keep on trying,
Yâall gonna make it (ah yeah) donât give up.
Donât ever quit, try and try and you can do it, donât give up (yeah)

If you want to catch a ball, but youâre having no luck at all.
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose.
It hits your belly, your chin and toes.
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
Youâll put your hands out in the air,
Youâll catch that ball, yes this I swear

Donât give up, keep on going.
Youâre on a boat, so keep on rowing
Donât give up, donât ever stop,
Try and try and youâll come out on top, donât give up.

You got yourself new roller-skates.
You put them on and you feel great,
Stand up, but then you fall,
Donât think you can skate at all.
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more,
And soon youâre skating across the floor.

Donât give up, keep on moving.
Youâre gonna get there just keep on grooving
Donât give up, donât pack it in,
Try and try and you will win, donât give up.
No no no, donât give up
No no no, donât give up
No no no, donât give up, no no
Donât give up

// Girl I Wait //

Feel your heart beating fast
Hold me close make it last
We knew this day would come
So take a breath leave me and
Was so scared of you leaving
Wish we could both just run

Wish we could run it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to
No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I wait
Wait wait wait for you oh

Our phone calls will have to do
Write you letters just to prove
You're the only thing on my mind
I know it's hard, but we'll get through
Just hold on I promise you
Soon you'll be here by my side
But we can't stop time
Seems like the clock is running way too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
But you don't have to ask

You know I wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Girl I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding on to

No matter how far
Girl I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
Girl I will wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do

Wait wait wait for you oh

// Girl In The Window //

Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
(But I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you

Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I suppose to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always wanna see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too

Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not gonna wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I... 
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

[Lil Wayne]
And I donât mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it
Cause you look like you never been
Youâre more like a Hellâs angel
And for you, Iâd rather sin
Broken heart, Love you with a broken heart
For you Iâll jump off Noahâs Ark
Love is blind and hope is dark
But why does pain feel so good
Love is science, live for you
Die for you, and Iâll die smiling

[Bruno Mars]
Easy come, easy go
Thatâs just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all,
But you never give
Should of known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked,
Cause what you donât understand is

[Hook]
Iâd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Iâd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know Iâd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till Iâm numb
Tell the devil I said âheyâ when you get back to where youâre from
Mad woman, bad woman,
Thatâs just what you are, yeah,
Youâll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash

You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you donât understand is

Iâd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same

If my body was on fire, ooh
Youâd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me youâre a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did babyâ¦

But darling Iâll still catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Iâd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know Iâd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby;
But you wonât do the same.
No, you wonât do the same,
You wouldnât do the same,
Ooh, youâll never do the same,
No, no, no, no

// Intro //

[Anderson .Paak:]
One, two, three, four!

[Bruno Mars (Anderson .Paak):]
Who y'all came to see tonight?
Who gon' get the ladies feeling something? (Who)
We gon' lock this groove in tight 
(Yeah, huh, well lock it in then!)
Don't have us lock groove down for nothing (Get down!)

[Anderson .Paak:]
Oh, oh
Lock, lemme got
Whatcha came to see? (Woo!)
Oh, oh (Where we at?)

[Bruno Mars:]
It's about that time to get out your seats and make some noise for our host
Give it up for Bootsy Collins!
[Bootsy Collins:]
Well alright!
It is I, Blaster of the Universe 
(Blaster of the Universe)
Bootzilla himself
Fellas, I hope you got something in your cup
And ladies? Don't be afraid to make your way to the stage
For a band that I name... Silk Sonic!

// It Will Rain //

If you ever leave me, baby,
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have,
We don't have it anymore.

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor (Ooh)
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door.

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin' "There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darlin' watch me change their minds
Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

Oh, don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye),
Don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same, if you walk away
Everyday it'll rain, rain, ra-a-a-ain

// Just The Way You Are (Remix) //

[Intro - Lupe Fiasco:]
First rule, never let em change you
Rule two, do you to the fullest
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be

[Bruno Mars:]
Oh her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah I know, I know
When I compliment her
She wont believe me
And its so, its so
Sad to think she don't see what I see

But every time she asks me do I look okay
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think its so sexy

She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Oh you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're searching for
Then just stay the same

So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great only silicon will bill it
A botox to kill it
You just killin off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

[Bruno Mars:]
The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

// Killa On The Run //

I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karmaâs a bitch now shuttup and take it
Look at the monster you created

You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karmaâs a bitch so shuttup and take it
Now Iâm a monster, monster you created

Yeah

Killa on the run run run run run run run run

I'm a killa on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring at my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killa on the run
K-k-killa, k-k-killa, k-k-killa
K-k-killa on the run
Killa on the run
K-k-killa on the run

Killa on the run [repeated]

Goodbye

You've got your lips along my body, 
And I'm not gonna stop you know, oh! 
You wanna take me to a place, 
Where I can't control my face somehow, oh! 
You know I'm down... 
So boy, you gonna let me down, oh!

Just... my days, 
It's yours, come get it, get it!

Sometimes I wonder what Heaven feels like?
I hope it feels like tonight,

I hope it feels like tonight, 
Hope it feels like tonight! 

The way you're getting in, 
I can tell you're not playing, no more! 
I'm am angel in disguise, 
With the devil as surprise for you, oh! 
There is no breaking, no stopping, 
Just go, go, go! 
We sing... and don't take it personal! 
It feels like Heaven when... 
Got me screaming on the morning, oh, oh!

Hope it feels like tonight!

// Long Distance //

There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time

And I'm running out of things to do
To get you off my mind
Oooh...

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday

With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, you're so far
This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me

Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days
While I'm away

Ya know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon
Coming home soon

All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again
Oh!
With you is where I'd rather be
(Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
(You were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
It's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)

Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooohhh... ooohhhh...)

With you is where I'd rather be
(Where I'd rather be)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

I wish that you were here with me
(You were here with me)
But we're stuck where we are (Oh)
And it's so hard (Oh)
You're so far (Oh)
This long distance is killing me

It's so hard, It's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me
It's so hard it's so hard
Where we are, where we are
You're so far
This long distance is killing me

There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time

// Mama's Worst Nightmare //

1, 2, 3 oh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby ain't scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long

I know some girls like good boys,
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love

Oh no,
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'mma take you home, even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare
[x2]

You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true

// Move On //

Whooo Whoooo

How do I end up in the same old place,
Faced again with the same mistakes,
So stubborn thinking I know what is right,
But life proves me wrong everytime,
Taking roads that lead me nowhere,
How do I expect to get there,
But when, oh when will I learn to just put you first.

I come to you now when I need you,
But why do I wait to come see you,
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on.
Can I move on.

Oh

When I am weak it's you that makes me strong,
And I know that you've been with me all along,
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart,
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard,
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first.

Hey!
I come to you now when I need you,
But why do I wait to come see you,
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on.

I get out of my own way, let you have your way.
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own,
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. Noooo

I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you,
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.
With only you, only you, with only you.
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on...

// Never Say U Can't //

Oh [4x]

[Verse 1:]
When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh

He taught me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)

[Pre-Chorus:]
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus:]
I wouldn't be
Where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't

He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh

[Verse 2:]
So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no

Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh

[Pre-chorus:]
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

[Chorus:]
I wouldn't be
Where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't

He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

[Bridge:]
Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know my son better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

[Chorus:]
I wouldn't be
Where I am
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't

He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't

// Only When You're Lonely //

Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you wanna call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Cuz I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl 
with no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cuz now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Cuz I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely 
If I say I'm gonna leave, that's the only time you want me 
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cuz now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely

Press your body,
on my body
Do it fast, do it slow,
you control the tempo
Look over your shoulder

Girl thereâs something about your body, body, body
Oh the way you shakinâ is so naughty, naughty, naughty
Right now we got our own little party, party, party
So good,
the way you press your body on me
All I need from you
is to press it

// Rest Of My Life //

Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed and we're still here today

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Seems like yesterday when she first said "Hello"
Funny how time flies when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait 'cause I finally found the one

Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

// Runaway //

Ohhh.
Ohhh woah...
So easy to forget our love,
All of the little things we do,
Like calling for no reason
Just to say the words
"BABY, I LOVE YOU"

I know lately, I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by
Without you crossing my mind
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day & make everything right

[Chorus:]
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated,
It only takes a day to change it.
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

So let's runaway...
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway... runaway...

Girl, you've been so patient
Spending nights alone & not complaining
But I'll make it up to you,
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that

[Chorus:]
Just take my hand,
Fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day,
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day

So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make everyday just like the day
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day.
Soo let's runaway...

// Starting Today //

We had a date, I stood you up
You tried to call, but I didn't pick up
See I forgot about our plans, please forgive me for ruining your night so many times

I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you had
So I'm stoppin' all the childish things,
Girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose

Girl, I know I broke your heart,
Trustin' me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)

I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

I'm tired of playin' 
the kiss and make-up game
And I apologize for the man I became
If I could do it all again
I woulda helped my best friend
And I would throw away all my selfish ways

I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't wanna be like every other man that you had
So I'm stoppin' all the childish things,
Girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose

Girl, I know I broke your heart,
Trustin' me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)

I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

When I say let it out, holla like you Jane of the jungle
And let me climb the tower
Feeling on your hair like Rapunzel
Every now and then, you like it rough
Sometimes you like it gentle
I just wanna make love all night
While we listen to the sounds of this instrumental
Treatin' your body like it Jell-O, booty like hello
Jiggle like Jell-O
Love it whenever you get ghetto
When I leave your body smokin' like a cigarillo
This here for grown folk, let's do it all night
And let it Bruno sing it to you like

// The First Time //

I feel like dancing the night away.
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time, 
for the first time, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake.
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time, 
for the first time, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

I think i might explode, this tension is so cold.
And all this fighting between us is really getting old.
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up.
We've both had enough, we've both had enough.
So let's just get away, go to that special place.
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away.
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I.
Only takes just one night..

Before we both give in..
Don't let it end..
Let's fall in love again.

I feel like dancing the night away.
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time, 
for the first time, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake.
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time, 
for the first tome, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

Before we both give in..
Don't let it end..
Let's fall in love again.
Oooh..

I feel like dancing the night away.
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time, 
for the first time, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake.
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time, 
for the first tome, remember our first time, 
time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta oooh.

// Today My Life Begins //

I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

I will break these chains that bind me happiness will find me
Leave that past behind me today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

I will break these chains that bind me happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

I will break these chains that bind me happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Today my life begins...

// Tonight //

[Bruno Mars: Chorus]
Maybe if I jump or spread my wings
I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if no one else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight

[Johnny Angel: Verse 1]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another cos she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
? you can achieve if you do believe
Gotta chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end

[Chorus]

[Johnny Angel: Verse 2]
Some 'bout the day
Some 'bout the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Years Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast...
Tryna hang on passenger...
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live gotta be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my Bella

[Chorus]

// Top Of The World //

It's your boy Bruno
Imma take ya to the top girl, hey 
Top of the world. you ready?
C'mon (let's go)

I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feelin'
So long my feet have been up off the floor
Destiny is what I call it
My Heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh

Till the day that I stop livin'
Girl my love I won't stop givin'
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feelin'
If you're with it girl, hear me girl
This is what I'll do

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I ain't never felt this way before

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours

Ha ooooh it feels so good baby yeah 
??

And to me you're like a flower
It's a blessing every hour
And I get to spend this time with you

// Valerie //

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie [x3]

Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house on up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for ya
Are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy?

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie [x3]

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?

Valerie [x6]

Why don't you come over, Valerie?

// Versace On The Floor (Bruno Mars vs. David Guetta) //

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

So, baby, let's just turn down the lights
And close the door
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Oooh take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

I unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

So just turn down the lights (down the lights)
And close the door (close the door)
Oooh I love that dress
But you won't need it anymore

// Voices In My Head //

All alone in my room
Waiting for, for this phone to ring
She'll come home someday soon
I just know or am I imagining things
The voices in my head keep saying
(The voices in my head)
She's coming back to you

Is it strange that I talk to myself (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Is it weird when I hear someone else (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
What do I do (what do I do)
There's no more you (there's no more you)
And I tell me you'll be coming home (coming home)
Is it strange I believe them again (oh oh oh)
Voices in my head

// Who Are You //

You use to tell that you loved me
Yeah that's what you would say 
You use to buy flowers even out on valentines day
You would surprise me with a dinner even though you just ate
But what happened? baby, what happened? 

[Chorus]
We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do 
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go 
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
And I don't recognize you no more 
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?
Woah oh, woah oh, woah oh, woah oh. 

You use to look me in my eye but now you just look away
If I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay
Oh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night
I promise, it's gonna be the last time

[Chorus 2]
We've been through some changes 
Like we in different places 
And now you think that you can just do what you do 
Without any consequences 
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do 
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore 
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
And I don't recognize you no more 
You're just a stranger, a stranger 
What happened to the man that you were before? woah 

What 'chu want me to do (do) 
I'm not gun' chase after you (you) 
Tell me how can I get (get) 
Back the man I first met (met)  

[Chorus 3]
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore 
You're just a stranger (don't know you no more)
A stranger and I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?

// Who Is //

Oh, I was perfect,
for the circus,
if she dared me I'd do it,
love makes you stupid.
I gave it up, but I guess it was not enough,
cause she never seemed satisfied.

Oooh ooh

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect.
Well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is?

Ooooh oooh Ooooh
Ooooh oooh Ooooh

She set the bar,
just above the stars,
a rocket couldn't reach it,
but i still kept on reaching.
She watched me try,
at least a thousand times.

If she loved me she'd stop me, but noo.

Oooh ooh

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect.
Well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is ?

I saw something worth my future,
So wrong, so wrong.
In my mind I would tell you soon
But I guess I wasn't wrong

Oooh ooh 

I know I'm not perfect,
but at the end of the day,
who is?

Oooh ooh

She wanted someone that's perfect,
well okay,
but can you tell me 
who is?

Ooooh oooh Ooooh
Ooooh oooh Ooooh
