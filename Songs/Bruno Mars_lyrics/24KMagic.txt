// Versace On The Floor //

Let's take our time tonight, girl
Above us all the stars are watchin'
There's no place I'd rather be in this world
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Underneath the chandelier
We're dancin' all alone
There's no reason to hide
What we're feelin' inside
Right now

So, baby, let's just turn down the lights and close the door
Ooh, I love that dress, but you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl

I'll unzip the back and watch it fall
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Girl, you know you're perfect from
Your head down to your heels
Don't be confused by my smile
'Cause I ain't ever been more for real, for real

So just turn down the lights
And close the door
Ooh, I love that dress, but you won't need it anymore
No, you won't need it no more
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Versace on the floor
Ooh, take it off for me, for me, for me, for me now, girl
Dance

It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it?
It's warmin' up
Can you feel it, baby?
It's warmin' up
Oh, seems like you're ready for more, more, more

You're probably the finest thing that I ever seen
And nobody at the party droppin' it low like the way that you do
You got me sayin', "Damn girl, break it down for me"

Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around
Just back it up on me girl, right now, right now

So gone, so gone, so gone
But your booty deserve a celebration
And I'm gonna celebrate it all night long
Come on here and show me why you got the whole club starin' at you
You got me sayin', "Damn girl, break it down for me"

Take it nice and slow, let me watch while you turn around

// Too Good To Say Goodbye //

I've made mistakes
I could have treated you better
I let you get away
There goes my happily ever after

Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Oooh, I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Yeah, I'm still in love with you, darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being brokenhearted?
I pray it's never too late

So tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it
