Album: June

// Day 1 //

To all deflowered women and men
I see your ceremony coming
In bloom

You're looking weary and used
I'm just a shadow in your view
Coming

And when I see you I light up like a grocery aisle
Stop saving face when I'm like whatever comes out, comes out
This boat is filling up with water

// Day 3 //

Zuleyka
I love to watch you work
Zuly with those Puerto Rican eyes
Big as baseballs
Oh it kills me

Who wants a drink? How can I serve you, Chinatown patrons of this karaoke bar?
While I'm around the corner, those Korean women, they'll sell me the flowers I buy to take you out

Zuly, promise me
When we make up all of the money
We'll buy us a pick up and leave this town

// Day 4 //

Pegasus come out to play
Tell me if I did something wrong
Did my sneakers kick at your wings?
Just two days ago, we rode towards the sun

Oh pegasus, you're my silver lining
Oh pegasus, you're my golden thread
Oh pegasus, you're all that I wanted
Oh pegasus, just come back to bed

// Day 5 //

I wake to find you bathed and dressed
I guess it's no secret, that sharing this bed
Isn't working

Remember that time a bird flew in our house?
We accidentally killed it, trying to get it to fly back out
And for some reason, I am thinking of this now
With you in that door way leaving

// Day 6 //

Your boyish reassurance is not reassuring
And I need it
And all of my devotion turns violent
When you go to her, don't expect to come home to me

I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off in general
Doesn't help that I'm a loser
And every woman seems so beautiful
Love me, love me

// Day 7 //

If you think I'm sexy you should say it now (just say I'm sexy)
I'm not the kind to sit around and wait
I know you're scared to feel so much so fast (so much so fast)
Why bear your weapons if you're not promising to bleed

Get that heart
On my tide

Cause Oregon girls never carry an umbrella
Even when it looks like it's going to rain
Oh this Oregon girl, never carries an umbrella
Cause Oregon girls used to raining everyday

// Day 8 //

Take off all your clothes and stand right there for a minute
Do you ever look at me and wonder if this is it?
Or if it's a memory, you are remembering a long time from now

// Day 9 //

I work a day job, I work a night job, I work inbetween jobs everyday
Amphetamine salts, you get me off, in the worst kind of way

This calls for some drugs
Drugs, drugs
(Oh my god you are just like your father, oh my god you are just like your father)

// Day 10 //

Dad brought the rock down on its head
Deer head
Splitting its skull open in half
Open

And the blood shone like VHS tape out of its skull and its severed leg
It was the right thing to do
And if purity was quantified, divide it in half each year you're alive
I was happier before
Not quite sure why it was right

// Day 11 //

Dreamed a million dreams last night
So forgive me if I seem weird

// Day 12 //

Oh one of these days when the work week gets low
I am taking you out to the movies
And buying everything you want with the money

Tell me I did good baby
You're proud of my eight bucks an hour
You don't need all of that big shit
You just want seats by the aisle

// Day 13 //

You look kind of different with your hair like that
I admire the way you look at your new woman

// Day 14 //

No man, no woman, no dog, or gun
Will ever make you feel safe as a woman

// Day 15 //

You don't know what I want
You don't know anything
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, not right
Scream out loud, kick the wall
Will you run when I call?
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, it's not right
Well my belly sure does hurt me, but it's O.K. 'cause I feel damn alive
The contractions come and go like a birth; but if a baby's on the way, I'd be surprised

He looks like a junkie sometimes
But junkies have beautiful eyes
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, it's not right
You're all tired of hearing me
Talk about the "sore tummy"
The doctors don't know anything
It's not right, not right
Well my belly sure does hurt me, but it's O.K. 'cause I feel alive
The contractions come and go like a birth; but if a baby's on the way, I'd be surprised, be surprised, surprised

// Day 16 //

Jeffrey's last Christmas, we let him go outside
The dog was slowly dying but we wanted him alive
For just one more holiday season, before we put him down

Jeffrey's last Christmas, we kept calling out his name
But he never came back to us, so a Christmas dog he remains
It was Jeffrey's last Christmas

// Day 17 //

Summer unfurls our honeymoon stage
Did you really think those awful things you said?
The heat is causing me to sweat every mental complex I have ever had

Sleeping between you and the AC window unit

// Day 18 //

Oh my sweet companion
You should leave me behind
I'm sewn to this harp, and I'm rotting
Waiting for the band to support my lifestyle

And I can't wait to see what you grow up to be
When you grow up

// Day 19 //

Financial security isn't something that's within my reach
Look at the moon, look at the moon, look at the moon

// Day 20 //

My heart is an emporium
Love for sale deals, deals, deals

// Day 21 //

Sue was chewing black gum after giving head
I was on the back porch chewing cherry Bubblicious

// Day 22 //

Six, six, six
Sixteen year old kids hudled around the grocery lot
"He punched out my teeth," so you said
So did the evidence; the blood and the dent in the car door from your head

I'm still ashamed don't say to be quiet
More embarrassing is that I forgave him

// Day 23 //

I met him at a party and he told me how to drive him home
He said he liked to do it backwards
I said, "That's just fine with me
That way we can fuck and watch TV."

It was four a.m. and the light was gray, like it always is in paperbacks
He asked if I liked playing jacks
I told him that I was good to sixes
But all hell broke loose after that

I told him that I knew Julia Roberts when I was twelve at summer camp
We didn't say anything after that
I dropped him off and I drove on home
Cause secretly I'm timid

// Day 25 //

I love the way they love each other
Why can't you love me like that?
With a complimentary facial formatting and perfectly suited astrological signs

I hate it when you leave the house

Why are we always watching TV?
When did we get so boring?
Why don't you ever reach for me in bed why don't we ever go out (even to like a Chilis or something)

It's nice to get out of the house

// Day 27 //

Won't you please leave that tree in the yard the fuck alone

// Day 28 //

Dreaming restaurant dreams where too many people keep coming in
And you're there, you don't know half of what I feel
When you tell me to close my eyes

It's an actors' game where you envision someone that you have done wrong
And say that you're sorry til the guilt is gone

// Day 29 //

I don't feel much of anything
I think squirrels are breeding in my ceiling
I hear my roommates making love upstairs
I'll hang myself in the kitchen that'll show them to keep it down

// Day 30 //

I wish I could keep you from abusing yourself for no reason
