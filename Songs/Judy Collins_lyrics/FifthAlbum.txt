// Pack Up Your Sorrows //

No use cryin', talking to a stranger
Namin' the sorrow you've seen
Too many sad times, too many bad times
Nobody knows what you mean

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use ramblin', walkin' in the shadows
Trailin' a wanderin' star
No one beside you, no one to hide you
Nobody knows where you are

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use gamblin' runnin' in the darkness
Looking for spirit that's free
Too many wrong times, too many long times
Nobody knows what you see

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

No use roamin', lying by the roadside
Seekin' a satisfied mind
Too many highways, too many byways
And nobody's walkin' behind

But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
And give them all to me
You would lose them, I know how to use them
Give them all to me

// The Coming Of The Roads //

Now that our mountain is growing
With people hungry for wealth
How come it's you that's a-going
And I'm left all alone by myself?

We used to hunt the cool caverns
Deep in our forest of green
Then came the road and the tavern
And you found a new love it seems

Once I had you and the wild wood
Now, it's just dusty roads
And I can't help from blamin' your going
On the coming, the coming of the roads

Look how they've cut all to pieces
Our ancient poplar and oak
And the hillsides are stained with the greases
That burned up the heavens with smoke

You used to curse the bold crewmen
Who stripped our earth of its ore
Now, you've changed and you've gone over to them
And you've learned to love what you hated before

Once I thanked God for my treasure
Now like rust it corrodes
And I can't help from blamin' your goin'
On the coming, the coming of the roads

// So Early, Early In The Spring //

So early, early in the spring 
I shipped on board to serve my king 
I left my dearest dear behind 
She oft' times swore her heart was mine

My love she takes me by the hand 
"If ever I marry, you'll be the man" 
A thousand vows so long and sweet 
Sayin' "we'll be married when next we meet" 

And all the time I sailed the seas 
I could not find one moment's ease 
In thinkin of my dearest dear 
And never a word from her could I hear 

At last we sailed into Glasgow town 
I strode the streets both up and down 
Inquiring for my dearest dear 
And never a word from her could I hear 

I went straightway to her father's hall 
And loudly for my love did call 
"My daughter's married, she's a rich man's wife 
She's wed to another, much better for life" 

If the girl is married that I adore 
I'm sure I'll stay on land no more 
I'll sail the sea till the day I die 
I'll break the waves rollin' mountains high

// Tomorrow Is A Long Time //

If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd lie in my bed once again

I can't see my reflection in the waters
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Can't remember the sound of my own name

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd lie in my bed once again

There is beauty in the silver singin' river
There is beauty in the sunrise in the skies
None of these and nothing else can match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes

Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear his heart softly pounding
If only he was lyin' by me
And I'd sleep in my bed once again

// Daddy You've Been On My Mind //

Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But Daddy, you've been on my mind

I don't mean trouble, please, don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading or saying I can't forget
I do not walk the floor bowed down and bent but yet
Daddy, you're just on my mind

Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter to me where you're waking up tomorrow
Daddy, you're just on my mind

I am not asking you to say words like yes and no
Please understand me, I got no place for you to go
I'm just breathing to myself pretending not that I don't know
Daddy, you've been on my mind

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know, I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on her mind

// Mr. Tambourine Man //

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though I know that evening's empire
Has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping

My weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's
Too dead for dreaming

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me on a trip upon your 
Magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering

I'm ready to go anywhere
I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade
Cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging
Madly through the sun
It's not aimed at anyone
It's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky, there are no fences facing

And if you hear vague traces 
Of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a ragged clown behind
And if to you he looks blind
I wouldn't worry, it's just a shadow that he's seeing that he's chasing

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

Take me disappearing 
Through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time
Far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, sheltered trees
Out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky 
With one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With memory and fate 
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you

// Lord Gregory //

I am a queen's daughter I come from Capakin
In search of Lord Gregory, Pray God I find him

The rain beats on my yellow head, the dew wets my skin
My wee babe's cold in my arms; Lord Gregory, Let me in

Lord Gregory, he is not here, I swear can't be seen
He's gone to bonny Scotland for to bring home a fair queen

So leave now these portals and likewise this hall
For it's deep in the sea you should find you downfall

Oh don't you remember, Love, that night in Capakin
When we exchanged rings, Love, and I against my will

Yours was pure silver and mine was but tin
Yours cost a guinea and mine but a pin

My curse on you, Mother, my curse being sore
I dreamed that my true love come a knocking at the door

Lie down now, my foolish son, lie down and sleep
Twas only a servant girl lies drowned in the deep

Go saddle my black horse, the brown or the bay
Go saddle the fastest horse in my stable this day

I'll ride over mountains and valleys so wide
I'll find the girl that I love and ride by her side

// In The Heat Of The Summer //

In the heat of the summer
When the pavements were burning
The soul of a city was ravaged in the night
After the city sun was sinkin'

Now no one knows how it started
Why the windows were shattered
But deep in the dark, someone set the spark
And then it no longer mattered.

Down the streets they were rumbling
All the tempers were ragin'
Oh, where, oh, where are the white silver tongues
Who forgot to listen to the warnings?

On and On come the angry
No longer following reason
And all the stores were the target now
Where just the other day they were buyin'

Drunk with the memory of the ghetto
Drunk with the lure of the looting
And the memory of the uniforms shoving with their sticks
Asking, ";Are you looking for trouble?";

"No, no, no," moaned the mayor.
"It's not the way of the order.
"Oh stay in your homes, please leave us alone
"We'll be glad to talk in the morning."

"For shame, for shame," wrote the papers.
"Why the hurry to your hunger?
"Now the rubble's resting on your broken streets
"So you see what your rage has unraveled."

Baricades sadly were risin'
Bricks were heavily flyin'
And the loudspeaker drowned like a whisperin' sound
When compared to the angered emotions

And when the fury was over
And the Shame was replacing the anger.
So wrong, so wrong, but we've been down so long
And we had to make somebody listen
In the heat of the summer

// Early Morning Rain //

In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
With an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with no place to go

Out on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
And I'm stuck here on the grass where the cold winds blow
Well, the liquor tasted good and the time went fast
Well, there she goes my friend, there she's rolling now at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

Well, this old airport's got me down, it ain't no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, this cold and drunk as I can be
You can't jump the jet plane like I can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

// Carry It On //

There's a man by my side walking
There's a voice within me talking
There's a voice, within me saying
Carry on, carry it on

They will tell their empty stories
Send their dogs to bite our bodies
They will lock us up in prison
Carry on, carry it on
When you can't go on any longer
Take the hand, hand of your brother
Every victory brings another
Carry it on, carry it on

Carry on, carry it on

// It Isn't Nice //

It isn't nice to block the doorway
It isn't nice to go to jail
There are nicer ways to do it
But the nice ways always fail

It isn't nice, it isn't nice
You told us once, you told us twice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

It isn't nice to block the doorway
Or to sleep in on the floor
Or to shout our cry of freedom
In the hotel or the store

It isn't nice, it isn't nice
You told us once, you told us twice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

Yeah, we tried negotiations
And the token picket line
Mr. Charlie didn't see us
And he might as well be blind

When you deal with men of ice
You can't deal with ways so nice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no

They murdered boys in Mississippi
They shot Medgar in the back
Did you say that wasn't proper?
Did you stand out on the track?

You were quiet just like mice
Now you say that we're not nice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
Sing it out, we don't mind, no, no, no

It isn't nice to block the doorway
It isn't nice to go to jail
There are nicer ways to do it
But the nice ways always fail

It isn't nice, isn't nice
Told us once, you told us twice
Well, thank you, buddy, for your advice
But if that's freedom's price, we don't mind
No, no, no, we don't mind, no, no, no
We don't mind
