Album: WhoKnowsWhereTheTimeGoes

// Hello, Hooray //

Hello! Hooray!
Let the show begin
I'm ready
Hello! Hooray!
Let the lights grow dim
We've been ready

Ready as the rain to fall, just to fall again
Ready as a man to be born, only to be born again, 
and again and again and again
Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin
I'm ready
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim
I'm been ready

Ready as the rain to fall, just to fall again
Ready as a man to be born, only to be born again,
I've been waiting so long for another song
I've been thinking so long I was the only one
We've been hoping so long for another song

So I will sit and I'm so thin
And I will laugh when this thing begins and begins,
And begins
It's then we'll be above the time and the weather
Dancing to a rolling good time on a feather
All it wants is coming here to stay
Each of them an actor, each one a play
I've been waiting so long for my song
I've been thinking so long I was the only one
We've were hoping so long for another song
So we will sit and we'll act so thin
And we will laugh when this thing begins and begins

// Story Of Isaac //

The door it opened slowly
And my father he came in
I was nine years old

And he stood so far above me
And his blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold

He said, "I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told"

So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his axe was made of gold

You who build these altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore

For you never had a vision
And you never have been tempted
By the Devil or the Lord

Yes, you who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before

When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word

And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I ask
"According to whose plan?"

When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will love you if I can

And may I never learn to scorn
The body out of chaos born
The woman and the man

And mercy on our uniform
Man of peace, man of war
The peacock spreads his fan

// Poor Immigrant //

I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone.
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with ev'ry breath,
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death.

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain,
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
Whose tears are like rain,
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass.
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass.

// First Boy I Loved //

First boy I loved,
Time has come I will sing you
This sad goodbye song,
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
Well, I haven't seen you, many is the short year
And the last time I seen you
You said you'd joined the Church of Jesus
Well me, I remember your long red hair falling in our faces
As you kissed me

And I want you to know, I just had to go
I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now
House and car and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now,
I'd just have to fall

We parted so hard
Me, rushing round Britain with a guitar
Making love to people
That I didn't even like to see
Well, I would think of you
Yes, I mean in the six sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
Try to hold your face before me

And I want you to know, I just had to go
And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now, kids and all
And you turned into a grownup male stranger
And if I was lying with you now,
I wouldn't be here at all.

I never slept with you
But we must have made love a thousand times.
For we were just young, didn't have no place to go
Yet in the wide hills and by many a long water
You have gathered flowers, and did they not smell for me?
And I want you to know, we just had to grow
And I want you to know, I just had to go

So it's goodbye first love
And I hope you are fine
I am a sweet man's woman
Maybe some day to have babies by
He's a true friend of mine
