// Hey Nelly Nelly //

Hey Nelly, Nelly, come to the window
Hey Nelly, Nelly, look at what I see
He's ridin' into town on a sway-back mule
He's got a tall black hat and he looks like a fool
He sure is talkin' like he's been to school, and it's 1853

Hey Nelly, Nelly, listen what he's sayin'
Hey Nelly, Nelly, he says it's gettin' late
And he says them black folks should be free
To walk around the same as you and me
He's talkin' about a thing he calls democracy, and it's 1858

Hey Nelly, Nelly, hear the band a-playing
Hey Nelly, Nelly, hand me down my gun
For the men are cheerin' and the boys are too
They're all puttin' on their coats of blue
I can't sit around here and talk to you, and it's 1861

Hey Nelly, Nelly, come to the window
Hey Nelly, Nelly, I've come home alive
My coat of blue is stained with red
And the man in the tall black hat is dead
But we sure will remember all the things he said, in 1865

Hey Nelly, Nelly, come to the window
Hey Nelly, Nelly, look at what I see
I see white folks and colored walkin' side by side
Thy're walking in a column that's a century wide
It was a long and a hard and a bloody ride, in 1963

// Winter Sky //

Out under the winter sky
Out under the winter sky
Stars come trembling on my eye
Stars to tremble my eye

And I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
I feel like someone's gonna die
Hand me wings for to fly

High is heaven in early morn
High is heaven in early morn
Men lie sleeping in beds that are warm
Sleep in beds that are warm

And I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
I feel like someone's being born
Tells my soul not to moan

// Tear Down The Walls //

Tear down the walls
Listen to freedom ringin' out
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the church bells ringin' out?

Give every man the chance to take his brother's hand
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

The music's everywhere when every man is free
The music's in the air that lights the road to liberty

Tear down the walls
One world in harmony
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the melody?

Hear every man sing it over the land
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

The music's everywhere when every man is free
The music's in the air that lights the road to liberty

Listen to freedom ringin' out
Tear down the walls
Can't you hear the church bells singin' out?

Let every man sing it over the land
Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls

// Bonnie Boy Is Young //

The trees they grow tall, the grass is growing green;
Many a cold and winter night that I alone have been.
It is a cold and cruel night when I must lie alone,
The Bonny Boy is young, but he is growing.

Oh! father, dear father I think you done me wrong
To go and get me married to one who is so young.
For he is only sixteen years and I am twenty-one.
The bonny boy is young but he's growing.

Oh! daughter, dear daughter, I did not do you wrong
For I have married you to a rich man's son
And he shall be a match for thee when I am dead and gone.
He is young, but he is daily growing.

Oh! father, dear father, I'll tell you what I'll do;
I'll send the boy to college for another year or two;
And all around his college cap, I'll bind a ribbon blue,
For to let the ladies know that he's married.

A year it went by and I passed the college wall
And saw the young collegians a-playing at the ball;
Amidst them was my own true love, the fairest of them all,
He was young but he was daily growing.

At the age of sixteen he was a married man,
And at the age of seventeen he was the father of a son,
At the age of eighteen, his grave had all grown green;
And the death put an end to his growing.

I'll make my love a shroud of ornamental brown;
And whilst I am a making it, the tears they will run down;
For once I had my own love, now he's lying low,
And I'll nurse his bonny boy while he's growing.

// Me And My Uncle //

Me and my uncle went riding down
From Colorado, west Texas bound.
And we stopped off in Santa Fe.
It being the point, about half-way.
And besides it was the hottest part of the day.

We led our ponies into a stall.
Went to the bar boys,got drinks for all.
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt.
It being summer, took off my shirt,
And tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

West Texas cowboys, all over town.
With gold and silver, they're loaded down
Just in from round-up, it seemed a shame.
So my uncle starts a friendly game.
High-low Jacks and the winner takes the gains.

From the beginning uncle starts to win
Them Texas cowboys they was mad as sin
Some say he's cheating but that can't be.
'Cos my uncle he's honest as me.
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys, he starts to draw,
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I shot me another he won't grow old.
In the confusion, uncle grabbed the gold,
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico.

Now God bless cowboys and God bless gold.
God bless my uncle and rest his soul.
He taught me well boys, taught me all I know.
Taught me so well that I grabbed that gold,
And I left him lying there by the side of the road.

// Wild Rippling Water //

As I was a walking and a rambling one day,
I met a fair couple a making their way.
And one was a cowboy, and a brave one was he.
And the other was a lady and a fair one was she.
The other was a lady and a fair one was she.

"Oh where are you going my pretty, fair maid?"
"Just down by the River, just down by the shade,
Just down by the River, just down by the spring
To see the Water gliding and the nightingale sing.
To see the Water gliding hear the nightingale sing."

They had not been there but an hour or so
When out of his satchel came fiddle and bow
He played a tune that made the woods ring
She said I can't hear the nightingale sing
She said I can't hear the nightingale sing

He said pretty lady it's time to give o'er
O' no pretty cowboy just play one tune more
I'd rather hear the fiddle or the touch of one string
Than to see the water gliding or the nightingale sing
Than to see the water gliding hear the nightingale sing

She said pretty cowboy will you marry me
O no pretty lady that never can be
I've a wife in Arizona and a lady is she
One wife and a cow ranch is aplenty for me
One wife and a cow ranch is aplenty for me

Well I'm going out to Mexico I'll stay about a year
I'll drink red wine, I'll drink lots of beer
If I ever return it will be in the spring
To see the water gliding and the nightingales sing
To see the water gliding hear the nightingale sing.

// The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll //

William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.
William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears.

// My Ramblin' Boy //

Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy

He stuck by me in the hard old days

We rambled 'round in the rain and snow

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy
Here's to you, my ramblin' boy

We thought we'd try to work one day

Says, "My old pal, we'd rather bum"

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

They took the only friend I had

Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

If when we die we go somewhere
I'll bet you a dollar he's ramblin' there

So here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

May all your ramblin' bring you joy

Here's to you, my ramblin' boy
May all your ramblin' bring you joy

// Red-Winged Blackbird //

Oh, can't you see that pretty little bird
Singing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black as coal

Of all the colors I ever did see
Red and black are the ones I dread
For when a man spills blood on the coal
They carry him down from the coal mines dead

Fly away you red winged bird
Leave behind the miner's wife
She'll dream about you when you're gone
She'll dream about you all her life

Oh, can't you see that pretty little bird
Singing with all his heart and soul
He's got a blood red spot on his wing
And all the rest of him is black as coal

// Coal Tattoo //

Travelin' down that coaltown road,
Listen to those rubber tires whine;
Goodbye to Buckeye and White Sycamore
I'm leavin' you behind.
I've been a coal man all my life
Layin' down track in the hole,
Got a back like an ironwood bent by the wind
Blood veins blue as the coal.

Somebody said "That's a strange tattoo
You have on the side of your head."
I said "That's a blue print, left by the coal
Just a little more and I'd be dead"
And I love the rumble and I love the dark
I love the cool of the slate.
But it's on down the new road lookin' for a job
It's the travelin' and lookin' I hate.

I've stood for the union, walkin' the line,
Fought against the company;
Stood for the U. M. W. of A.
Now who's gonna stand for me?
I got no house and I got no pay,
Just got a worried soul;
And this blue tattoo on the side of my head
Left by the number nine coal.

Someday when I'm dead and gone
To Heaven, the land of my dreams,
I won't have to worry on losin' my job
To bad times 'n big machines.
I ain't gonna pay my money away
For pensions and hospital plans.
I'm gonna pick coal where the blue heavens roll
And sing with the angel bands.

// Cruel Mother //

There was a lady lived in the North,
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
She fell in love with her faither's clerk,
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

He courted her a year and a day,
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
Till her the young man did betray.
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

She leaned her back up against a thorn,
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
There she had two pretty babes born.
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

She took her penknife, keen and sharp.
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
She has stuck it through their hearts.
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

As she was walking her father's path,
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
She saw two babes a-playing ball.
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

She said "O, babes, if you can tell",
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
"What kind of death I have to die."
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

"Seven years a fish in the flood",
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
"Seven years a bird in the wood".
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

"Seven years a tongue in the warning bell",
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
"Seven years in the flames of hell".
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

"Oh, welcome, welcome, fish in the flood",
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
"Welcome, welcome, bird in the wood".
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

"Welcome, welcome tongue in the warning bell",
Oh, the rose and the linsie O,
"God keep me from the flames in Hell."
Down by the greenwood sidie, O.

// Bottle Of Wine //

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me go back and start over

Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickels and dimes
Time's getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me back and start over

There's a little hotel, older than Hell
Cold as the dark in the mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me a little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me go back to start over

Well the preacher will preach and the teacher will teach 
The miner will dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me go back to start over

Well, pain in my head and bugs in my bed
My pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Buy me a little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me go back to start over 

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Let me alone, let me go home
Let me go back to start over

// Medgar Evers Lullaby //

Bye bye my baby, I'll rock you to sleep,
Sing you a sad song, it might make you weep.
Your Daddy is dead and he'll never come back
And the reason they killed him, because he was black.

I'll tell you a story that you ought to know;
It happened in our town a short while ago.
Your Daddy was walking alone for some air
And a man in the bushes was waiting right there.

That man shot your Daddy and laughed while he died.
Your Daddy lay dying with tears in his eyes.
He cried for the things that a man leaves undone
And he cried for the dreams that he had for his son.

What will you do, son, when you are a man?
Will you learn to live lonely and hate all you can?
Will you try to be happy and try not to see
That all men are slaves 'til their brothers are free.

Bye bye my baby, I'll rock you to sleep,
Sing you a sad song, it might make you weep.
Your Daddy is dead and he'll never come back
And the reason they killed him, because he was black.
