// Maid Of Constant Sorrow //

I am a maid of constant sorrow
I've seen trials all of my days
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

Your friends may say that I'm a stranger
My face they'll never see no more
There is but one promise that's given
I'll sail on God's golden shore

All through this world I'm bound to ramble
Through sun and wind and drivin' rain
I'm bound to ride the western railway
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

I am a maid of constant sorrow
I've seen trials all of my days
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

// The Prickilie Bush //

O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Will you stay it for a while
I think I see my mother coming
Ridin' over yonder stile
Mother, did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
For to save my body from the cold clay ground
My neck from the gallows tree
I didn't bring you gold
Or silver to pay your fee
But I have come to see you hang
On the gallows tree

O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Will you stay it for a while
I think I see my father comin'
Over yonder stile
Father, did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
Or have you come to see me hang
On the gallows tree
I didn't bring ya gold
Or silver to pay your fee
Your mother and I have come today
To see you on the gallows tree

O, the prickilie bush
It pricks my heart full sore
If I ever get out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it anymore

Hangman, stay your rope
Once more for a while
I think I see my darlin' comin'
Over yonder stile
Darlin', did you bring me gold
Or silver to pay my fee
For to save my body from the cold clay ground
My neck from the gallows tree

I brought ya gold
And silver to pay your fee
I did not come to see you hang
On the gallows tree

Oh, the prickilie bush,
It pricks my heart full sore
But now that I'm out of the prickilie bush
I'll never get in it any more

// Wild Mountain Thyme //

Ohh, the summer time is coming
And the leaves are sweetly turning
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather

Will you go? Laddie go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go? Laddie go

If my true love will not go
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather

Will you go? Laddie go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go? Laddie go

// Tim Evans //

Tim Evans was a prisoner within his prison cell
and those who read about his crime they damned his soul to hell
saying "go down you murderer, go down"

For the murder of his own dear wife and the killing of his child
the jury found him guilty and the hanging judge, he smiled
saying "go down you murderer, go down"

Tim Evans pleaded innocent and swore by Him on high
he never killed his own dear wife or caused his child to die
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They moved him out at 6 o'clock to his final flowery dell
and day and night two guards were there and never left his cell
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

Sometimes they played cards with him - solo and pontoon
to stop him brooding on the rope that was to be his doom
saying go down you murderer, go down 

The governor came in one day with a chaplain by his side
said "your appeal has been turned down, prepare yourself to die"
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

Tim Evans walked in the prison garden, the guards walked behind
he saw the sky above the wall and knew no peace of mind
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They fixed the rope around his neck, buckled behind his ears
the prison bell was tolling but Tim Evans did not hear
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

A thousand men were cursing and banging on their doors
but Tim Evans did not hear them, he was deaf for evermore
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he didn't do
It was Christie was the murderer, the judge and jury too
saying "go down you murderer, go down"

// Bold Fenian Men //

Twas down by the glenside I spied an old woman
She was pluckin' young nettles and she scarce saw me comin'
I listened a while to the song she was hummin'
Glory O Glory O to our bold Fenian men

'Tis sixteen long years since I saw the moon beamin'
On strong manly forms and their eyes were not gleamin'
I see them all now, sure in all my daydreamin'
Glory O Glory O to our bold Fenian men

Some died on the hillside, some died with a stranger
And wise men have judged that their cause was a failure
They fought for their freedom and they never feared danger
Glory O Glory O to our bold Fenian men

I passed on my way, thanks to God that I met her
Be life long or short, sure I'll never forget her
There may have been brave men but they'll never be better
Glory O Glory O to our bold Fenian men

// Wars Of Germany //

Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the bloody wars
Of high Germany
For they've carried off my own true love
Left a broken heart to bleed

The drums beat in the morning
Before the break of day
And the wee, wee pipes played loud and shrill
While yet the morn was gray

And the bonnie flags were all unfurled
Was a gallant sight to see
But sorrow for my soldier lad
Who marched to Germany

Oh, woe be to the orders
That marched my love away
And woe be to the bitter tears
I shed upon this day

And woe be to the country
Where our men are forced to be
And woe be to the foreign wars
That stole my love from me

// O Daddy Be Gay //

There was an old man who lived under the hill
O daddy be gay
There was an old man who lived under the hill
If he ain't goin' away he'd be livin' there still
Daddy be gay if you can be

One day the devil came down to his plow
O daddy be gay
One day the devil came down to his plow
Said one of your family I'll have to have now
Daddy be gay if you can be

O tis not just your son or daughter I crave
O daddy be gay
Tis not your son or your daughter I crave
But your old baggin' wife I'll carry away
Daddy be gay if you can be

Ah take her away with all of my heart
O daddy be gay
Take her away with all of my heart
And I'll bet the two of you never will part
Daddy be gay if you can be

The devil he hoisted her up on his back
O daddy be gay
The devil he hoisted her up on his back
And off to hell with her in a pack
Daddy be gay if you can be

He set her down at the fork in the road
O daddy be gay
He set her down at the fork in the road
He said old woman you're a hell of a load
Daddy be gay if you can be

Then he carried her down to the gates of hell
O daddy be gay
He carried her down to the gates of hell
Said rake up the coals and we'll roast her well
Daddy be gay if you can be

One poor little devil looked over the wall

O daddy be gay
One poor little devil peeked over the wall
He said take her home daddy she'll murder us all
Daddy be gay if you can be

O the devil he hoisted her up on his back
O daddy be gay
The devil he hoisted her up on his back
And home again with her in a pack
Daddy be gay if you can be

The old woman went a whistlin' over the hill
O daddy be gay
The old woman went a whistlin' over the hill
The devil won't have me I wonder who will
Daddy be gay if you can be

There is an advantage we have over men
O daddy be gay
There is an advantage we have over men
We can go down to hell and come back again
Daddy be gay if you can be

// I Know Where I'm Going //

I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
And the devil knows who I'll marry

I have stockings of silk
Shoes of bright green leather
Combs to buckle my hair
And a ring for every finger

Feather beds are soft
Painted rooms are bonny
I would trade them all
For my handsome winsome Johnny

Some say he's bad
I say he's bonny
Fairest of them all
My handsome winsome Johnny

I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
The devil knows who I'll marry

// John Riley //

A fair young maid was in her garden
Strange young man came riding by
He said fair maid, will you marry me?
And this answer was her reply

Oh no kind sir I cannot marry thee
For I've a love and he sails the sea
And though he's been gone for seven years
Still he will return to me

Well, what if he's in some battle slain
Or if he's been drowned in the deep salt sea
Or if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be

If he's in some battle slain
Then I shall die when the moon doth wane
And if he's drowned in the deep salt sea
Still I'm true to his memory

And if he's found another love
And he and his love both married be
I wish them health and happiness
Where they live across the sea

He picked her up in his arms so strong
And kisses he gave her one two three
Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley

Said weep no more my own true love
I am your long lost John Riley

// Pretty Saro //

Down in some lone valley in a lonesome place
Where the wild birds all whistle and their notes do increase
Farewell Pretty Saro I must bid you adieu
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go

My love she won't have me and I understand
She wants a rich merchant and I have no land
I cannot maintain her, I've no silver and gold
Can't give her the nice things that a big house will hold

But if I were a merchant and I could write a fine hand
And I'd write my love a letter that she'd understand
I'd write it by the river where the waters o'erflow
And I'll dream of Pretty Saro wherever I go

// The Rising Of The Moon //

Ah then tell me Sean O'Farrell
Tell me why you're hurrying so
Hush my boy oh hush and listen
And his eyes were all aglow
I bear orders from the captain
Get you ready quick and soon
For the pikes must be together
At the rising of the moon

Ah then tell me Sean O'Farrell
Where the gatherin' is to be
In the old spot by the river
Right well known to you and me
One thing more for signal token
Whistle up the marchin' tune
With your sword upon your shoulder
At the rising of the moon

Rumors passed along the valley
Like a banshee's lonely croon
And a thousand blades were flashin'
At the rising of the moon

All along the singing river
That dark mass of men were seen
Far above their shining weapons
Hung their own immortal green
Death to every foe and traitor
Foreign strike the marchin' tune
And hurrah me boys for Ireland
Tis the rising of the moon

Well, they fought for poor old Ireland
And full bitter was their fate
Oh what glorious pride and sorrow
Fill the name of ninety-eight
Yet thank God while hearts are beating
Foreign manhood's burnin' noon,
We shall follow in their footsteps
At the rising of the moon.

Death to every foe and traitor
Foreign, strike the marchin' tune
And hurrah me boys for freedom
Tis the rising,
Tis the rising of the moon
