// My Guy //

Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy,
(My guy)
Nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy.
(My guy)
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter,
Like birds of a feather we stick together,
I'm tellin' you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy.

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy,
(My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy.
(My guy)
I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm gonna,
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy.

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops,
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.
(What you say, tell me more)

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.

// Get You In Our Love //

Night moves feel it sway
Eyes meet hear them say come closer
Don't move. Oh we'll rock you
Don't wait. Oh baby, come little closer

Just like a heartbeat
You're under my skin

There's only one way
This night's gonna end

We gonna get you in our love
Get you into our love
Gonna wrap you up we're not gonna stop
Till we fit you like a glove
Before the night is over
Gonna get you into our love

Sweet rush when we touch
Can't you feel how much we want you
Cool ocean of the night
Whispers it's alright we want you
No one before you could reach us like
This might be surrender
But we can't resist no

We gonna get you in our love
Get you into our love
Gonna wrap you up we're not gonna stop
Till we fit you like a glove
Before the night is over
Gonna get you into our love

// Il Macquillage Lady //

Je me sens belle, sensationnelle
Regardez-bien
Mon maquillage n'est-il pas extraordinaire?

Look in her face, can you see through?
All the deep mascara and the red rouge
She'll do anything, to make her beautiful
Does her lipstick do the trick?

She's an "il maquillage lady"
Hiding in a mask of fantasy
She's an "il maquillage lady"
Painting on illusions of what she really wants to be

Glamour girl, needs a paint brush
All it takes, erase and make a better face
Take time, she can be so fine
Makeup, magic makeup he'll adore

She's an "il maquillage lady"
Hiding in a mask of fantasy
She's an "il maquillage lady"
Painting on illusions of what she really wants to be

Vous me trouvez bien?
Regardez, je suis trÃ¨s gentille
Mon maquillage
Belle

Look in her face, can you see through?
All that deep mascara and the red red rouge
She'll do anything, to make her beautiful
Does her lipstick do the trick?

She's an "il maquillage lady"
Hiding in a mask of fantasy
She's an "il maquillage lady"
Painting on illusions of what she really wants to be
She's an "il maquillage (hot) lady"

Vous me trouvez bien?
Regardez, mon maquillage n'est-il pas extraordinaire?
Je me sens belle
Vous trouvez? Tu es trÃ¨s gentil

// All The Man I Need //

I used to cry, I used to cry each night
But that was all before you came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now you're here, it's not the same, it's not the same

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all the man I need

And in the evening when the moon is high
I'll take you down and rock you slow
And in the morning when I kiss your eyes
I hold you close and won't let go, I won't let go, no

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all, all I need

You know something?
You're the most beautiful lady in the world!

I love you!
You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all, all I need

Baby, baby, baby

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all the man that I need

Every move that we make
Brings us closer to

We're a team and we're gonna make it

We ain't sittin' back
Life's too short fo that
We're all winners each time we go out and try
Like we said, there's so much ahead
Every step that we take
Brings us closer to being the winners we are

There's no stopping us
We ain't had enough
We're a team and we're gonna make it
We ain't had enough
There's no stopping us
Look out world we're a team
