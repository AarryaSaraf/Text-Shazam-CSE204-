// Brother, Brother, Stop //

Brother, hear me
I'm talking to you
There's something I've got to say
Brother, clearly
I'm speaking the truth
I know my words can't erase

All the feelings you fear inside
All the hurt you buy
The confusion then know that you're going trough

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you

Ooh, brother
My heart is on fire
I've yet so much of your pain
Brother, sincerely
I feel your desire
I know that you're not to blame

All the feelings you fear inside
All the hurt you buy
The confusion then know that you're going trough

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you

Angels, let it consume
I know the world can be cruel, yeah
Your brother should rather love you
This is a fight we can't lose

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you

// Do It To The Max //

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at

Oh, you're walkin' tall
Lookin' slick in your three-piece at 4 AM
You got a shiny ring
On your pinky with your zodiac sign
On the surface you're cool
But inside you can't count past three
But then your pretty smile
Ain't sayin' nothin' to me

There's no such thing as [?] steppin'

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at

You stay in front of the mirror
The whole day so that you can be
The finest thing any girl
Could possibly meet
But you go to a party
Just to stand up against the wall
'Cause your head's too tight
And your shoes are too small

There's no such thing as [?] steppin'

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at

If you wanna express yourself
Then you got to feel it
[?] never, ever be born with
And remember the beautiful people
Can only relate the truth
You will shine
When folks believe in you

There's just no need in [?] steppin'
Steppin', steppin', steppin', steppin'

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the...

// Frankie //

Hey Frankie?!
I was walking down the street one day

When I looked up I saw a friend.
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?

He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much.
Way back then we were friends going together
But then you left me.
Frankie - do you remember me? Frankie - do you remember?

You were fifteen
I was twelve
It was summer
We were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me
I'm thrilled to your touch.
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me?

Oh how you brought me down - down down.
All I did was runnin' around - around.
You'll never know how much I loved you.

Frankie - do you remember? Do you remember me? Frankie -
You walked me to the Deli
Then we sat in the booth where it all began.
I looked into your big eyes
And I said to myself we coulda have twins.
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?
Oh how you brought me down - down down...

He looked at me and then I blushed ...
Frankie - do you remember me? Do you remember me?
Frankie
My Frankie
My baby
Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie

I'm thankful for the music
It brought me through the past
It pulled me through the hard times

// I've Seen Better Days //

The sun is shinin' down
There's not one cloud around
And the mornin' hits me
Where I lay
And everything is green
A perfect day, it seems
Yes, he's got everything
Goin' his way

But I've seen better days
I've seen better days
When the rain was fallin' down
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(Wrapped around me)
I've seen better days
(I've seen better days
I've seen better days)

The neighbors come and go
They smile and wave hello
And all the kids are out
To play
Lollipops and good times
They look so much like mine
But he has taken mine
Away

I've seen better days
I've seen better days
When the rain was fallin' down
(When the rain was fallin' down)
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(Wrapped around me)
I've seen, I've seen better days

(I've seen better days
I've seen better days)
When the rain was fallin' down
(When the rain was fallin' down)
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(I've seen better days)
I've seen better days
(I've seen better days)

Mama sure made sure
Her words were fit
For justifyin'
From the kinda lyin'
That the guys were tryin'

Yeah, I sure learned a lot
But somehow she forgot
All about the guys
With the tender eyes
Who can steal your mind

Mama never told me
About the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

So shy
So bashful
Just a part of the master plan
Mama never told me
Look out for the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

Sing along now

Ooh-ooh yeah
My mama never told me

Mama did her best now
I do believe
But she forgot to tell me
That still water runs deep

Now I've fallen in
Well, so far so good
Now I ask myself
Could it be somehow
I misunderstood?

'Cos mama never told me
About the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

So shy
So bashful
Just a part of the master plan
Mama never told me
Look out for the quiet man
Mama couldn't help herself
'Cos my daddy was a quiet man

Sing along now

// When The Boys Meet The Girls //

You need somebody
Who needs somebody
I need somebody
I need someone like you

You got that new talk
You got that cool walk
I want what you got
Don't ya need somebody too?

So right
So young
So here I come

I'm feelin' the heat around the world
When the boys meet the girls
Jump to the beat around the world
When the boys meet the girls
I need somebody
You need somebody too

The girls are dancing
The boys advancing
Casual glances
I wanna dance with you

Rockin' and slammin'
Up on the bandstand
Excellent jammin'
Don't ya need somebody too

The night is young
We're havin' fun

I'm feelin' the heat all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
Passion runs deep all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
Freak out your feet all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
