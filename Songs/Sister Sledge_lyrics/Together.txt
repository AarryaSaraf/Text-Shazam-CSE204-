Album: Together

// Blockbuster Boy //

I think I'm in love
You got my soul on fire
I can't get enough, no, no, no
You got my soul on fire
So let us get down, down
You got my soul on fire
Gonna have you around
You're so bad (You're so bad, you're so bad)
And that's good

Blockbuster boy
You caused a love explosion
Blockbuster boy
You really blew my mind
Blockbuster boy
Baby, I got all my love feeling for you
My blockbuster boy
I feel so right

So let your love flow
You got my soul on fire
Come on you got to let it show
You got my soul on fire
Whatever you do
You got my soul on fire
No one does it like you
You're so bad (you're so bad, you're so bad)
And that's good

Blockbuster boy
You caused a love explosion
Blockbuster boy
You really blew my mind
Blockbuster boy
Baby, I got all my love feeling for you
My blockbuster boy
I feel so right

// Do The Funky Do //

If your natural high now
Ain't the natural you, no
Do what you feel
'Cause the feeling you got inside you
Only reflects the real you

Don't hang your head and cry
Cause can't relate to reality

Kick off your shoes if it pleases you

If the things you do ain't you
With that phony smile you're wearing, yeah
Makes that phony attitude

Kick off your shoes if it pleases you
To do your funky do

// Hold On To This Feeling //

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Hello, how have you been?
It's so nice to see you again
I've been thinkin' of ways to make you feel good
Anything you want, it's understood

'Cause you're more than a lover, you're a friend
Do or die you're still the end
And I remember it well, it was on a sunny morn'
On that day, a beautiful love was born

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

I need and you are there
I'm so glad to know that you care
Only for me, baby and what I need
A friend in need is truly a friend indeed

And you look in my eyes when I cry
You hold my hand, you understand
Always I know, I can depend on you
To make all of my dreams come true
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

All this huggin' and squeezin'
And lovin' and pleasin'
And cuddlin' and teasin'
The thought of you leavin', just forget it, boy

// As //

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

// Sneaking Sally Through The Alley //

Snaking Sally through the alley
He's sneaking Sally through the alley

He's sneaking Sally through the alley
Trying to keep her out of sight
He's sneaking Sally through the alley
When up pops his wife

He said, "He can't find nothing wrong with being friends
'Coz sometimes she lets me use her car"
She said, "If you can't find nothing wrong with your mind
You better find something wrong with her"

So he began to try to explain
That it just wasn't, just wasn't, just wasn't what she thought
He'd better find something to do with his time
The fact is he's just been caught
He's got no business

Sneaking Sally through the alley
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally

He's sneaking Sally through the alley
Oh, he's trying to get away, trying to get away
Trying to get away clean, yeah
He's sneaking through the alley with Sally, yeah
When up pops the queen

Trying to double talk, get himself in double talk
Catching himself in lies
Mama just looked at him as if he was crazy
Oh, she didn't even bat an eye

So he began to try to explain
That it just wasn't, just wasn't, just wasn't what she thought
He'd better find something to do with his time
The fact is he's just been caught, oh
He's got no business

Sneaking Sally through the alley
Hey, hey
Hey, hey now
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally
Sneaking Sally through the alley, yeah
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally
Oh, she caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally

// Baby, It's The Rain //

So I'm losing you
And I know it's goodbye
I see our good love dying
And I'll be strong
You think that I'm crying
But you're wrong

Baby, it's the rain (Baby it's the rain
Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
No, no, I'm not crying (I'm not crying)

I'm smiling again (Whoa yeah)
Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
It looks like I'm crying (Oh yeah)
But you're not to blame (You're not the blame)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I know life goes on
And I'll try to forget
I see our good
I see our good love dying
And it's so sad
But I know the tears can't
Can't keep you back

Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
No, no, I'm not crying (Oh no)
I'm smiling again (I'm smiling)
Baby, it's the rain (It's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
It looks like I'm crying (Ooooh, ooh, ooh)
But you're not the rain (You're not to blame)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Baby, it's the rain (It's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
No, no, I'm not crying
I'm smiling again
Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)
Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
It looks like I'm crying (It looks like I'm crying)
But you're not the rain (No, no)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

It's the rain....
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do

// Hands Full Of Nothing //

Mmm, mm, mmm
Mmm-hmmm, mmm

The taxi's waiting and I've go to go
Just for the last time, let me kiss you
Please don't forget me 'cause I love you so
And every day now I will miss you

It's over (It's over)
It's over (I know it's over)
Once we were dreaming
Mmm, life had a meaning

We'll follow the sun (We'll follow the sun)
Where has it gone? (Where has it gone?)

CHORUS:
Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why

Tell me why
I wanna know is why, tell me why

I can't stay longer, I got to go
I don't wanna show you that I'm crying
I've lost your sweet love and that's all I know
Your lips are cold now, they're not lying

It's over (I know it's over)
It's over
Once love was growing
Ooh, your eyes were glowing
We'll follow the sun (We'll follow the sun)
Where has it gone? (Where has it gone?)

Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why

Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why
