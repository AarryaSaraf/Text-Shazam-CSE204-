// He's The Greatest Dancer //

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so borin', filled without-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing

I really wasn't carin' but I felt my eyes starin'
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit as a man he is complete
My crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, please take me home

He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Ooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I've ever seen)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I love your moves)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I've ever seen)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
(I love your moves)

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

// Lost In Music //

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music

Have you ever seen
Some people lose everything
First to go is their mind, huh
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh

I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody
That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music

Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight
The band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity
To me, it's my sanity
I could never survive

Some people ask me
What are you gonna be
Why don't you go get a job? Uh-uh
All that I could say
I won't give up my music
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh, oh

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back (Ooh...)
We're lost in music

We're lost in music (Don't take our away our music)
Feel so alive (Feel)
I quit (I quit) my 9 to 5 (Yeah)
We're lost in music

We're lost in music (Melody is good to me)
Caught in a trap (I'm caught up in it)
No turnin' back (No, no, no)
We're lost in music (Ooh... doo doo doo doo doo doo)

We're lost in music (La da da da da da da da, mmm... hmm...)
Feel so alive
I quit (I quit) my 9 to 5
We're lost in music (Lost in music)

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my 9 to 5
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

// Somebody Loves Me //

Here I am again, alone in my lonely room
How can I believe you loved me?
Here I sit, just thinking of it
All the time that we spent together

We were holding hands
Making lots of plans, the good things
A lover and a friend to me
You were so easy to love

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

What happened boy, to the love we shared
How can I believe you loved me?
I just need to know that you cared
Honetly, is the love still there?

And if you me like you say you do
Why don'e we make plans for two?
All I need is some kind of sign

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?

How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
How can I believe
That somebody loves me?
...

// Thinking Of You //

Everybody let me tell you 'bout my love
Brought to you by an angel from above
Full equipped with a lifetime guarantee
Once you try it, I am sure that you'll see

(Without love) There's no reason to live
(Without you) And what would I do with the love I give
(All my lovin') To you I'll be giving
And I promise, yes I'll do, as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That makes me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
Hey, it's you and the things you do to me

All the time he makes me glad that I'm alive
Together we will survive
What do you think brought the sun out today
It's my baby, oh, help me sing

(Without love) Without love there's no reason to live

(All my lovin') To you I'll be giving
And I promise, yes I'll do, as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me

// We Are Family //

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(And) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie

(All) all of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

We are family (Hey, y'all)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing (sing it to me)

We are family
I got all my sisters with me

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight

(We) no, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no
This is our family jewel

// Easier To Love //

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Won't somebody please explain
Why all the hurt and the pain?
Can't you make'em see
It's not supposed to be
All this beautiful land
See the children playing in the sand
I put to you this question
What you at tolerate destruction?
And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

What more can I say
War is this game to play
Give a person a little might
Well that don't make him right
And I hope and pray
Oh please let the children play
All this killing each other
You should be loving your brother
And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Let me hear you say:

(I do) I love you [repeat 7 times ad lib]

And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

// You're A Friend To Me //

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

Hello, how have you been?
It's so nice to see you again
I've been thinkin' of ways to make you feel good
Anything you want, it's understood

'Cause you're more than a lover, you're a friend
Do or die you're still the end
And I remember it well, it was on a sunny morn'
On that day, a beautiful love was born

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

I need and you are there
I'm so glad to know that you care
Only for me, baby and what I need
A friend in need is truly a friend indeed

And you look in my eyes when I cry
You hold my hand, you understand
Always I know, I can depend on you
To make all of my dreams come true

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

All this huggin' and squeezin'
And lovin' and pleasin'
And cuddlin' and teasin'
The thought of you leavin', just forget it, boy

// One More Time //

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time

You keep saying that you want to love me
And I know you know that I know it's true
Surely it can't be so hard to tell me
Baby, you love me and I love you

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time

You know a girl needs to hear it
If all the things you say are true
Why can't you tell me if you feel it
I shouldn't always have to
Be the one to tell you

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time

Say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
Say it, say it one more time
Kiss me, say it one more time
