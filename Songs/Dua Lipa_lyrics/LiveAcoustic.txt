// Golden Slumbers (Acoustic) //

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way
To get back home

Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

// In The Room : Tears Dry On Their Own (Live) //

All I can ever be to you
Is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to

Once it was so right
When we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

And knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached

It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away I have no capacity

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand
Why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand

We coulda never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you
A perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon

I can't play myself again
I should just be my own best friend

Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

She walks away
The sun goes down
She takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above
A blaze

I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets

So we are history
The shadow covers me
The sky above
A blaze that only lovers see

He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way
And this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away
The sun goes down

She takes the day
But I'm grown

And in your way

My deep shade

My tears dry on their own

My tears dry on their own

// I'd Rather Go Blind (Live) //

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out

Ooh, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face

And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking

// New Rules (Piano Acoustic) (Live) //

Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy

Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards

Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart

Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
