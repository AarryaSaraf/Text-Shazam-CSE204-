(Future nostalgia)
(Future nostalgia)
(Future nostalgia)

You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game
Like modern architecture, John Lautner coming your way
I know you like this beat 'cause Jeff been doing the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, future nostalgia is the name
(Future nostalgia)

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future)

(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha
(No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha
(No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)

Can't be a Rolling Stone if you live in a glass house (Future nostalgia)
You keep on talking that talk, one day you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face (Future nostalgia)
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future)

(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha
(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do I'm gonna get it without ya
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female Alpha
(Future nostalgia)

You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants, haha

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound (Future nostalgia)
My sound, my sound (Future)

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future)

// Don't Start Now //

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh

// Cool //

Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going 'till we see the sunlight

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby I could see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
Got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losing my senses
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite, tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby I could see us in the real life
You know, you know, you got

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool

I'll give it to you
All night

Got me losing all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

Got me losing all my cool
'Cause I'm burning up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
Got the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never running out of juice
When its only me and you
When its only me and you

(Hey, aye, yuh)

I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer
You got me, you got me losing all my cool

// Physical //

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
Cuz this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep, when I got you next to me?

All night I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on, come on, come on
Let's get physical

Hold on just a little tighter
Come on
Hold on, tell me if you're ready
Come on

// Levitating //

If you wanna run away with me
I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
(I'm levitating)
You, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
(I'm levitating)

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

// Pretty Please //

Somewhere in the middle I

I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window (Yeah)

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension

// Love Again //

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)

// Break My Heart //

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling

You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but this time I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I woulda known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

// Good In Bed //

(Hey)
Yeah, let's get to the point yeah
You love to disappoint me, don't cha?
You tell me what I want
But ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could
Probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
And the long nights where we did everything
But talk it through, that's what we do yeah
You always let me down boy
But when you going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone
Who do me like you do

I been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands upon my waist

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

We don't know how to talk
But damn we know how to fuck

I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my
Head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other
Mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
Ple-e-e-e-ease
Come take it out on
Me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really
Bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

// Boys Will Be Boys //

It's second nature to walk home
Before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles
When there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here
Sick intuition that they taught us
So we won't freak out
We hide our figures
Doing anything to shut them out
We smile, a way to ease the tension
So it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

I'm sure if there's something
That I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man
Around to save the day
And that was sarcasm
In case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on T.V
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride

Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company

Been fightin' hard for your love, and I'm runnin' thin on my patience
Needin' someone to hug, even took it back to the basics

Might've threw me off, but can't nobody stop the movement (Uh huh)
Let's go, left foot, right foot, levitatin' (C'mon)
Pop stars (Go), Dua Lipa with DaBaby
I had to lace my shoes for all the blessings I was chasin' (Go)
If I ever slip, I fall into a better situation
So catch up, go put some cheese on it, get out and get your bread up (Yeah, yeah)
They always leaving you far, but you run together (Hey)
Weight of the world on my shoulders, I kept my head up
Now baby stand up, 'cause girl you

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let me take you for a ride)

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

// Fever //

Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I could feel it inside

I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
(I've got a fever)

Peut-Ãªtre qu'avec du temps, Ã§a partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne m'y vois pas
Comme un mÃ©dicament, moi je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais que j'essaye, que je perds du temps dans tes bras

I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
(I've got a fever)

Car dans mes yeux, Ã§a se voit
La fiÃ¨vre dans les yeux, oui Ã§a se voit
Mon cÅur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix
Le plus souvent, c'est quand je pense Ã  toi

I've got a fever, can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
(Amour en fiÃ¨vre)

Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down

Car dans mes yeux, Ã§a se voit
La fiÃ¨vre dans les yeux, oui Ã§a se voit
Mon cÅur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix
Le plus souvent, c'est quand je pense Ã  toi

// We're Good //

I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it
Go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

Now you're holding this against me
Like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
(Like sleeping and cocaine)
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
(To go our separate ways)
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

// Prisoner //

Prisoner, prisoner
Locked up, can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh whoa
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you
Why can't you just let me go?

I can't forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

// If It Ain't Me //

I bet we're higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you
When you're right by my side, uh

I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So baby, don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

I got a little Devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination
Ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh

I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So baby, don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

So baby, don't you let go
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here?
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears?

So baby, don't you let go (Uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby, if you ever (Uh-uh)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me

// That Kind Of Woman //

One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman (Woman)
(That kind of woman, woman
That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to me
I want you to myself
No I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one, one of many

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

I'll be the first to say

(Gonna)
Keep you close, next to me

(You're gonna)
Reminisce
That you once met a girl like this
The first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
(That kind of woman)

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"

// Not My Problem //

We doing good
We doing good
That's your problem

Pulling me down like an anchor
Saying it's my fault you're angered
Telling me no one will love me (Watch your mouth)
Telling me I'm gon' be lonely
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)
You had me on for a good run
Thinking that you were a good one
Under your palm, yeah, you like that (What the fuck?)
Now it's my turn to bite back (I've had enough)

Ooh, did it to yourself
Playing with my mind
Putting me through hell
Ooh, I'd be broken too
If you left me like
Like I left you
(That's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

Doing it all for reaction
Doing the most in your caption
Making me seem like the bad guy (Watch your mouth)
Tryin' to bring me down, but nice try
(Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me now)

I used to like you
How did I like you? (What the fuck?)
I used to like you
And now I don't (We doing good)

Ooh, I'd be broken too
If you left me like
Like I left you
(That's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

I thought I liked you, I thought you was cool
But I'm a thot when I be drinking, don't be thinking shit through
Nevertheless, you got the clue
And now you blue 'cause I ain't speaking to you
Aww, boo boo, you'll be cool, don't boo-hoo
Boo, what's the issue?
JID j-just listen, this bi-, this chick trippin'
I'm dipping, I'm dipping, I'm done with it
I'm stupid, I'm dumb, come with it
I've heard them all
I'ma call you one name (That's your problem)

Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)
Not my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem
If you got issues (That's your problem)

// Un Dia (One Day) //

You know sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never want to fall again

Yo no te quisiera olvidar
Pero contigo es todo o na'

You are deep in water
Now you are drowning us
You question my love
Like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up

You regret it now
But it's your mistake
What makes you think
That my mind will change
And you hate that you know, you know, you know, you know
You messed up

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

AcÃ©rcate un poquito no mÃ¡s
Que yo quiero que te quedes conmigo
Deja tus amigas allÃ¡ atrÃ¡s
Que nos vamos en un viaje escondidos
Nos vamos pa' Turk & Caicos
Y ahÃ­ calmamos las ganas
SuÃ©ltate conmigo, mama
Que ya no hay marcha atrÃ¡s

Una noche sin ti, no es tan fÃ¡cil, baby
Que yo soy pa' ti, y tÃº eres pa' mÃ­
Nunca me dejes de querer
Oh, na, na, na
Contigo por siempre, baby
No quiero dejarte esta vez

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

Ya sÃ© que estoy en tu corazÃ³n
QuizÃ¡s en el fondo
Otras babies me escriben, nunca les respondo
La vida da vueltas y el mundo es redondo
Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London
O si no en Marbella
Encima de la arena viendo las estrellas
Yo sÃ© que ni olas han borrado mi huella
Pero tu pichaera es lo que me atropella

Sol, playa y en la arena vamo' allÃ¡
Baby, no te quedes calla'
Yo sÃ© que tÃº quieres guayar conmigo
Otra vez me tienes en depresiÃ³n
Fumando en la habitaciÃ³n
Pero yo sÃ© que

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feeling how I've been feeling, baby
Knock on my door

One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try

One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll realize am more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend
