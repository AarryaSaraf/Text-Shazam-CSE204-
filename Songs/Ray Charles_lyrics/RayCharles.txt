// Ain't That Love //

Now, baby when you sigh

I wanna sigh with you
When you cry

I wanna cry some, too

Now, ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Oh, ain't that love that I feel
(that I feel)
In my heart for you

When your friends

Turn their back on you
I'll be here
(I'll be here)
Just to see you through

Now, ain't that love

Wanna talk some, too

Now, ain't that love

Oh, ain't that love that I feel

In my heart for you

If you ever

Ever need a friend
I'll be with you
(be with you)
Yes, until the end

Now, ain't that love

Ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Don't you know, baby don't you know, I
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ain't that love, baby that I feel
In my heart for you

[Instrumental Break]

Baby, won't you let me hold your hand
I want to squeeze you as tight as I can
Baby, don't you need my by your side
To protect you and be your guide
Baby, I'm so in love with you
I'd do anything you tell me to

Now, ain't that love
(ain't that love)
Ain't that love
(ain't that love)
C'mon now, ain't that love, now
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
Ain't that love, baby that I feel
In my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh, that I feel in my heart for you
Oh!

// Drown In My Own Tears //

It brings a tear,
Into my eyes,
When I begin,
To realize,
I've cried so much,
Since you've been gone,
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,
I sit and cry,
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
I know it's true
Into each life
Some rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more
Why don't you
Come on home
Oh yes so I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll
(drown in my own tears)
Ooh, don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
When I'm in trouble, baby
(drown in my own tears)
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me
(drown in my own tears)
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Oh, mmmmm.

// Come Back Baby //

Oh come back, baby
Oh mama please dont go, yeah

// Funny (But I Still Love You) //

My dear sweetheart, I'm writing you Aguarde...
Just a few lines to tell you that I'm low	
Oh, baby, my baby	
Funny, but I still love you	

You went away, didn't say goodbye	
But I still love you, Lord, I wonder why	
Oh, baby, my baby	
Funny, but I still love you	

I don't know who was right or who was wrong	
All I know as I'm so tired, so tired of being alone	
But if you care, like I care	
Catch the next stream line, bring yourself back here	
Oh, baby, my baby	
Funny, but I still love you	

I miss your lovin'	
You know what I mean	
Remember how you used to make me scream	
Oh, baby, my baby	
It's funny, but I still love you

// Losing Hand //

I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand
Your ways keep changing like the shifting desert sand

While I was playing fair baby, you played a cheating game
While I was playing fair baby, you played a cheating game
I know you don't care, but I love you just the same

I thought I'd be your king baby, yes and you could be my queen
I thought I'd be your king baby, yes and you could be my queen
But you used me for your joker Â´cause I thought you're deal was clean

The way you did me pretty baby, I declare I never understand
The way you did me pretty baby, I declare I never understand
I gambled on your love baby and got a losing hand

// A Fool For You //

I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more
I want to know
Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child
A fool for you
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you
I know you told me
You didn't want me 'round
And I know
You got a man way 'cross town
So I know it's something
Oh, what makes me be
Do you believe me child
I'm a fool for you
Ohoh, no, I'm a fool for you
Did ya ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day
Reach over and feel the pillow
Where your baby used to lay
Then you put on your crying
Like you never cried before
Oh lord
Yeah you even cry so loud,
You give the blues to your neighbor next door
Ever since you were five years old
I been a fool for you, little girl
Way down in my soul
I'm a little fool for ya
So I know it's something
Oh, oh, Lord
I'm a fool for you

// Hallelujah, I Love Her So //

[Words in parentheses ( ) are alternate words, depending on which gender is singing the song.]

Let me tell you 'bout a boy (girl) I know
He(She) is my baby and he (she) lives next door
Ev'ry morning 'fore the sun come up
He (she) brings my coffee in my fav'rite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know hel'll (she'll) go with me until the end
Ev'rybody asks me how I know

That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so

Now if I call him (her) on the telephone
And tell him (her) that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four,I hear him (her) on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
He (she) kisses me and he (she) holds me tight
He (And) tells me "Baby, (Daddy) ev'ry thing's all right"
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love him (her) so

// This Little Girl Of Mine //

Wella, oh yeah
Wella, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Do you know that this little girl of mine
I want you people to know
This little girl of mine
I take her everywhere I go
One day I looked at my suit
My suit was new
I looked at my shoes
And they were too
And that's why I, I, I, I,
Oh, I love that little girl of mine
Oh do you know that this little girl of mine
Makes me happy when I'm sad

Loves me, even when I'm bad
She knows how to love me right down to her teeth
If she does any wrong, you know she keeps it from me
And that's why I, I, I, I,
Oh, I love that little girl of mine

Do you know that this little girl of mine
Called me last night about eight
This little girl of mine
Told me that we had a date
She said that she'd meet me at a quarter to nine
Believe it or not, but she was right on time
And that's why I, I, I, I,
Oh, I love that little girl of mine
Do you know that this little girl of mine
Knows how to dress so neat
This little girl of mine
Stops the traffic on the street
When the fellas start whistling, well I don't mind
I can't blame them, 'cause she is fine
And that's why I, I, I, I,
Oh, I love that little girl of mine
And that's why I, I, I, I,
Oh, I love that little girl of mine

// Greenbacks //

As I was walking down the street last night
A pretty little girl came into sight
I bowed and smiled and asked her name
She said, "Hold it bud, I don't play that game"
I reached in my pocket, and to her big surprise
There was Lincoln staring her dead in the eyes.
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
She looked at me with that familiar desire
Her eyes lit up like they were on fire
She said, "My name's Flo, and you're on the right track,
But look here, daddy, I wear furs on my back,
So if you want to have fun in this man's land,
Let Lincoln and Jackson start shaking hands."
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
I didn't know what I was getting into
But I popped Lincoln and Jackson, too
I didn't mind seeing them fade out of sight,
I just knew I'd have some fun last night
Whenever you in town and looking for a thrill
If Lincoln can't get it, Jackson sure will
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

We went to a nightspot where the lights were low
Dined and danced, and I was ready to go
I got out of my seat, and when Flo arose,
She said, "Hold on daddy, while I powder my nose"
I sat back down with a smiling face,
While she went down to the powder place
With my greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll
The music stopped and the lights came on,
I looked around and saw I was all alone
I didn't know how long Flo had been gone
But a nose powder sure didn't take that long
I left the place with tears in my eyes
As I waved Lincoln and Jackson a last goodbye
On a greenback, greenback dollar bill
Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll

// I Got A Woman //

Well...

She saves her lovin', early in the mornin'

I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah

She's there to love me
