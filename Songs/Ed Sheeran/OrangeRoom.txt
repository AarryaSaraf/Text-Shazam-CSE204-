// Moody Ballad Of Ed //

Come on now
Dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you

Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away

Far away

You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again

And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you
I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still gone to pack my bags

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away

You didn't know me
(I've run away)
You couldn't show me
(What you have to say)
My one and only
Has gone away

Far away

// Misery //

Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
'Cos they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she's cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery

// Typical Average //

Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
'Cos, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?
Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)
Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
(Typical average teen)

// Addicted //

I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again
And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon
and stars
And I'm gone
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home
So please come home

// I Love You //

I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home

But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love you
