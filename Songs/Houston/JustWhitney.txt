// One Of Those Days //

Na na, na na na na
Cam on, cam on, cam on, ohh
Ohh, this is just for me
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na

Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I got to do something special for me
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Got to take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

Tonight, it's all about me
Just want to set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight, I'll just let a little TV watch me
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The Isley Brothers going to hold it down, sing

Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I need one of those days
You don't know how, ooh, ooh, ooh

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful

// Tell Me No //

Reaching for my dreams
And you're so quick to say what I can't do
You criticize my action
But I don't see you standing in my shoes
I'm going the wrong way
I'm doing the wrong things
Every word just gives me fuel
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

For every step I take you're right there
Trying to block my next move
If you're making me feel bad
Then tell me then do you feel good
I'm just human and all I'm doing
That's what my heart tells me I should
So come on come on come on come on come on come on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

No no no no no no no
It motivates me more and more
And I think it's time you know
Giving me something to work forward
And I can't wait for the day
I can rub things in your face
I ain't going to stop 'til I'm done
I reach the top I'm the No. 1
For every time you try and tell me no
Oh it makes me keep on keeping on

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

And tell me no
And I'll show you I can
And tell me no
I dig my feet right in
Tell me no
Just tell me that I can't win
So come on
I'm sure I'll prove you wrong
Go on and go
Tell me no

// Things You Say //

Oh baby, baby, oh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Such a pleasure loving you, it's all mine
I smile each day away
I feel better knowing you
Ooh, you've got me thinking

It's better to give than take

// My Love //

Some girls just want to spend guys money
Live their lives chasing the milk or honey
Silver lives are their fantasy
But you're lucky 'cause that ain't me

Most girls think guys are all the same
Not you so I can take the blame
I love you through the joy and pain
Even the coldest Georgia rain

See my love is like an open sky
See my heart is like a river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

Some think that love is just a word
Because of all the things they've heard
They think they're got to close their hearts
Can't see the light, the soul in the dark

But I know I got a real good man
Who loves me the best as he can
That's why I'm here faithfully
Because you'll do the same for me

See my love is like an open sky
See my heart is like a river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

You got to go through
The fire (the pain)
The rain (the joy)
Take the joy and do it in pain
(Never give in)
Give in
Don't give up
(Don't give up)
They can try but it will never never break my love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
See my love

See my love is like an open sky
See my heart is like a river wide
No my world would never ever run dry
It runs over for you and I
See my love is deeper than the sea
And sweeter than a pretty melody
So tell everybody that you're glad you've got me
You can trust in my love
My L-O-V-E
(My love, my love, my)

// Love That Man //

Things just ain't the way that they used to be
Back in the day when a man meant security
After working hard all week
Baby kick back and throw up your feet
Let me fix you a treat
So it might be a little bit sweet
But he's worth it
He deserves it
He may not be perfect
But he's all the man I need
He's ready and willing
Gives me the feeling, ah
And whenever we're together
I know I'm where I belong

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

Things they ain't the way they used to be
When a woman and a man work hard to be
Happy in love and stand together ooh
(Let's stay that way forever)
When you get into a fight
Just try to work it out
Never give up on him
That's not what love's about
Stay true to your feelings
And remember
All the things he's done for you

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love
That everlasting feeling can never be too much
Somebody loves you heart and soul
Hold on, don't stop
And never let him go

It's just the way he looks into your eyes
Love that man
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize
Love that man
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares
And he's always there (He's always always there)
Don't you love that man (I know)

// On My Own //

I'm wiser now
I'm not the foolish girl you used to know
So long ago
I'm stronger now
I've learned from my mistakes which way to go
And I should know
I put myself aside to do it your way
But now I need to do it all alone

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah

It's over now
I can't go back to living through your eyes
Too many lies
And if you don't know by now
I can't go back to being someone else
Not anymore
I never had a chance to do things my way
So now it's time for me to take control

And I am not afraid to try it on my own
I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'll keep it real you know
Time for me to do it on my own
Yeah yeah, mmm, yeah yeah

Oh I start again go back to one
I'm running things my way
Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm going to take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own
And I don't care if I'm right or wrong
I'll live my life the way I feel
No matter what I'm going to keep it real you know
It's time for me to do it
See I'm not afraid

// Dear John Letter //

I'm sitting here
In my own head thinking
How you could be staring in
Got my number two
And I'm writing you
Contemplating on the paper what I should do
On the fireplace, with the mail man
Should I tell you or should I hold it in
If my heart wasn't in it
Baby you could just forget it
I'd be gone in a New York minute

You never give me attention
I know you never had bad intentions for us
So I'm writing you
But I always fail to mention
'Cause you know I really don't like to fuss
So I'm gonna hold it in

I'm writing you Dear John
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you Dear John

Sometimes I think that I've had enough
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks
You know I'm listening
Some days I'm really touchy and
Some days I'm willing to forget and
Some days I'm still in love with you
Some days I'm sad and blue

When I don't check myself
I get frustrated with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know that it's not just you
It's some of my negligence too
And I can't go through with mailing this to you

Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you a Dear John letter
Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door

I get frustrated with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know that it's not just you
It's some of my negligence too

Dear John letter
I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I

I tried to stay but it never got better
I couldn't tell you face to face but I
I had to let you know
Sometimes I want to hit the door
I'm writing you a Dear John

I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it makes me feel better
I'm writing this letter
Because it, oooh
I'm writing this letter, baby
I can't go it, oh no no no
I can't can't can't
I can't stay
Mmmm
I'm writing you this letter
I'm writing you Dear John
I'm writing a Dear John letter
I'm writing a Dear John letter
I'm writing a Dear John letter
I'm writing a Dear John letter
I'm writing a Dear John letter

// Unashamed //

If I changed my mind
If I changed my faith
Every time a stop light signaled
Each time I made mistakes
I don't think that I
Would be where I am today
I live my life without regrets
What you see is
What you see is
What you see is what you get
And I'm

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Adding up my life, it totals all my dreams
I'm counting all my blessings
And the gifts I have received
Still there's always someone
Something to overcome
Took all my life to understand
That I am what I am, who I am
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Do you
Do you want to know how it goes?
Do you want to control how I feel?
Do you want to stay in my life?
Then listen here, and listen good
You got to get it
Got to get it
Got to get it right!
Unashamed

Unashamed of the life I lead
Unashamed of the strength on my knees
Of choices I've made
Of the love that I've saved
Of the things I've done
My belief in the One
Unashamed of the words of my friends
I know who they are
Make mistakes, make amends
Follow my instincts, my star
On my sleeve I wear my heart
Unashamed

Say what you want

// You Light Up My Life //

So many nights I sit by my window
Waiting for someone to sing me his song
So many dreams I kept deep inside me
Alone in the dark but now
You've come along

And you light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?
Finally, a chance to say hey
I love you
Never again to be all alone

'Cause you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

And you
You light up my life
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song
With song
You give me hope
To carry on
You light up my days
And fill my nights with song

It can't be wrong
When it feels so right
'Cause you
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh

Don't think you're stressing me
Because your lies don't excite me, no no

(Never thought)
Never thought, never thought
(Never knew)
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me
(Be my enemy) Be my enemy

Oh you know you're wrong
Don't want to respect my song
But it's okay because either way
My following is real strong
You try so hard to show the whole world what I do
Now I'm turning the cameras back on you
Same spotlight that once gave me fame
Trying to dirty up Whitney's name

(Never thought)
Never thought, never thought
(Never knew)
Never knew that you would do this to me
Do this to me
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me

(Tell me, tell me, tell me)

Messing with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Trying to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facing
All you know you need to stop it
Defaming my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you looking at me

Why you looking at me
Don't get mad at me
Because I'm still going to be me
(Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Whatchulookinat

As we proceed

Don't get mad at me 'cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me
You've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

See, I don't understand why you keep peepin' me

Never knew (Never knew that you) that you would do this to me (Do this to me)
Tried to ruin me (Ruin me), you're my enemy (You're the enemy)

That you (That you) would act as if you're cool with me
(So why you lookin' at me?)
Why you lookin' at me?

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad)
'Cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me
You've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

Oh, you know you're wrong
Don't wanna respect my song
But it's okay 'cause either way
My diamond ring is real strong
You try to show the whole world what I do
But now I'm turnin' the cameras back on you
The same spotlight that once gave me fame
Tryin' to dirty up Whitney's name, no, no

Never thought (Never thought, never thought, never thought)

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

Messin' with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Try to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facin'
Oh, you know you need to stop it
Teeth into my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you lookin' at me

Houston, we have a problem
Yo, turn me up, ha
I can't get mad if you look at me (Yeah)
'Cause on the real, look at me
Y'all don't know what it took for me or what it took to be
On top from where the hook in me
I'm public enemy number one, you've been warned
I'm victory in the human form
It's only wise that you move along
Bad Boy, yeah, we move the song
Think not, prove me wrong
Too many dudes wanna earn a rep
S. Combs and I earn respect
That's the difference, the trick is I'm hard to manage
The only ones that can judge me is God or Janice (I love you mama)
It's the man that won't stop, the girl that won't quit (That's right)
Diddy, Whitney, it's an instant hit
Yeah, Bad Boy
(Why you lookin' at me?)
Yeah, let's go

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me (Still gon' be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I feel your eyes on me (Feel your eyes)
You've been tellin' lies on me (You're tellin' lies, lies, lies)
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Why you lookin' at me?

I'm only human, feel me? I'm just like you
I'ma make mistakes, too
God's child
I like this right here
Whitney Houston
Why you lookin' at me?
We love you
