// Cutting Onions //

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

Shit ain't been the same since you left
I hope God plan to take me next
You the reason why I been depressed
Every birthday I'ma wreck
Therapy to get it off my chest
I'm so hurt, I'm tryna do my best
I can never seem to handle death
Hours spent where you last slept
Had ya last outfit prepped
Weezy lied, she ain't even check
Honestly, I'm still upset
Nefertiti chain just to rep
PopPop died, you was never good
Woulda left with him if you could
I was selfish, I misunderstood
I was dumb, I shoulda understood

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

I can't help but think I shoulda called
More than I did but I stalled
Wilma still drinkin' through a straw
Sianni gettin' big, so tall
Rocky still locked down
All your grandkids love you, you a star
Mary you the realest, so raw
Mary you the realest, so

I can't lie I really, really miss you
Wishing I could hug and just kiss you
Walk around cryin', need a tissue
Walk around, I'm cryin', need a
I can't lie I really, really miss you
Wishing I could hug and just kiss you
Walk around, I'm cryin', need a tissue
Baby girl, you know I got issues

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

Grandma died, I was cuttin' up onions
I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

// Sorry //

Hey, it's me
I've been, I been calling you all day
I just really think we need to have one last conversation
Just give me a chance to explain myself
I know I was wrong
I just wanna be able to say that to you face to face
I love you

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry if I made you feel weak
Honestly, I had a bad week
Three feet, it wasn't that deep
TLC, I hope he don't creep
Kiss me on the cheek but not neat
You the only one that know I'm freaky
I been on ya head, widow's peak
Got me crying tears by the creek

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry, baby, can you take me back?
I know I been actin' like a brat
Call me, please, tell me where you at
When you leave I always want you back
We can make it work, I know it's true
I don't got no faith in me, it's you
People say I'm crazy over you
But they don't know the shiut that we been through

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry, if I called you out of your name
My OG had to put me on some game
I don't wanna lose you to the game
You know it be hard to manage fame
Really I'm sick 'cause I'm to blame
Shoulda never went against the grain
I ain't got much to really gain
If I lose you now, it'd be a shame

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through stuff (Sorry, sorry)
This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through stuff
This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through stuff (Sorry, sorry)
This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through stuff

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone (This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through)
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs (This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through)
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home (This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through)
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long (This ain't nothin' new, we been goin' through stuff)
