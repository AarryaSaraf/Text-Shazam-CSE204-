// Sleeping On The Blacktop //

Sunshine beating on the good times
Moonlight raising from the grave
String band playing worn out honkey-tonks
Pretty young thing going dancing in the rain

High heel lady spitting at the nickajack
Business man with a needle and a spoon
Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

Three dead in a crash on the number 4
Two witnesses below and up high
Not sure whose will be done
You can call me a sinner for wondering why

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

Corn liquor tastes sweeter in this town
Could it be it's the same as the last?
I swear I've seen ya face elsewhere before
Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

// Johnny Boy's Bones //

Well I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away
Dixieland

Oh musket and cannon have torn his gray coat
Don't he look fine and handsome
Don't he look at his most
45 in the foxhole and at this I will boast
Don't they look fine and handsome
My poor Johnny Boy's Bones

Well who will bring back my Johnny Boy's Bones
To lay beneath the trees of his Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

Well he died for his country
And he died for his kin
And he died killing men
A most honorable sin
But them mean boys in blue
They done turned him in
When they laid him low
With a laugh and a grin

Well who will bring back my Johnny Boy's Bones
To lay beneath the trees of his Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

// Caroline //

There's a place where the sun doth shine
And the birds keep time with the pines up yonder
That's the home of my Caroline
She's dancing in the sky

Oh, how sweet when we meet
On the golden streets of the great wide valley
These old chains around my feet
They're pulling me back down

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

And my bones do break and my hands do shake
As I lie in the wake of time's cruel slaughter
But if I die before I wake
I'm gonna see my Caroline

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

There's a place where the sun doth shine
And the birds keep time with the pines up yonder
That's the home of my Caroline
She's dancing in the sky

Caroline, oh Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name's next to mine

Caroline, my Caroline
I'll be home just at any old time
The grave and the garden won't be satisfied
Until your name is next to mine

// Living On The Sand //

Leave them lights as they are
And keep your clothes on, I've had
More than my fill
Of whiskey and women
And good-hearted villains, but there's a
Wickedness in me still
Keep that gun locked away
Locked away boy
Well you know you're an angry young man
Going in town with six rounds
You're sure to be hell bound
That house you've got is built on the sand

I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promised land
On the sand

Don't look twice, look twice at that bottle
You'll claim that Jesus turned the water to wine
You'll be wishing that wine you were drinking was water
When you're jumping the bridge in the night
Forgive me, forgive me
Don't it sound more clear when I'm
Screaming day after day
I've lost all my patience
I'm wasted on waiting on
Making my next mistake

I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promised land
On the sand
I've been living on the sand
Don't take much to guide my hand
Far from promise land
On the sand

// Ballad Of A Law Abiding Sophisticate //

Well, marry me
To a rope and a tree
What that ol' judge called first degree

And all the folks around town
Swore to lay me
In the ground
They found out I put that poor boy down

You see I
Did not much care
For the way
That he'd sit and glare
So I closed
His eyes for good
With a bar-room chair

So, gonna lay my poor bones
Past Appalachian stones
Far beneath that cold ground all alone

Oh but if you're asking me
Where I would rather be

It was worth it
To see that boy
Cut from the knees

// Nothin' //

Hey mama, when you leave
Don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing
I can't use nothing
Take care into the hall
And if you see my friends
Tell em I'm fine
Not using nothing

Almost burned out my eyes
And threw my ears down to the floor
I didn't see nothing
I didn't hear nothing
I stood there like a block of stone
Knowing all I had to know
And nothing more
Man, that's nothing

Brothers our troubles are
Locked in each others arms
And you better pray
That they never find you
Cause your back ain't strong enough
Burdens doublefold
They'd crush you down
Down into nothing

Being born is going blind
And bowing down a thousand times
To echoes strung
On pure temptation
Sorrow and solitude
These are the precious things
And the only words
That are worth remembering

// The Devil Wears A Suit And Tie //

Well
Reverend, reverend please come quick
'Cause I've got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks
Of Good Ole Miss
He drove a series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip

Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

And he said
I know you, I know you young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six-string picker
Just as I am
Let me learn you something
I know a few turns to make all the girls dance

Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

Oh
Foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons
Had a price, oh sweet price
My sweet soul, everlasting
A very own eternal light

Don't you know that the devil wears a suit and tie
Saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
Well, the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
