// Evangelina //

And I dream in the morning
That she brings me water
And I dream in the evening
That she brings me wine

Just a poor man's daughter
From Puerto PeÃ±asco
South of the border
In old Mexico

There's a great hot desert
South of Mexicali
And if you don't got water
You'd better not go

Tequila won't get you
Across that desert
To Evangelina
In old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the woman I love
Is drivin' me insane
Knowin' she's waitin'
And I can't get there

God only knows that I wracked my brain
To try and find a way
To reach that woman
In old Mexico

And I met a kind man
He guarded the border
He said, "You don't need papers
I'll let you go

I can tell that you love her
By the look in your eyes, now"
She's the rose of the desert
Of old Mexico

And the fire I feel for the woman I love
Is drivin' me insane
Knowin' she's waitin'
And I can't get there

God only knows that I wracked my brain
To try and find a way
To reach that woman
In old Mexico

And I dream in the morning
That she brings me water
And I dream in the evening
That she brings me wine

Just a poor man's daughter
From Puerto PeÃ±asco
South of the border
In old Mexico

Evangelina
I miss you so
