// Western Swing & Waltzes //

East of beautiful Alberta
North of old Montan'
The livings fine, when the springtime's kind
To a bovine raising man

Where they sort 'em, and stretch 'em, and tail 'em down
Like they did in days gone by
And good slab fence, and common sense
Are ne'er in short supply

Where the iron still hits the fire
And the rope's thrown straight and true
And they scorch their hides, till upon their sides
The brand is showing through

And the spring time turns with the coulee's curve
And it's summer once again
Whoopi ti yi yo, at the rodeo
And we pray our buddies win

It's Western swing and waltzes
Like to wear out your boots
It's horsehair floors, and Louis L'Amour
After they close the chutes
When they've rode up all the rank ones
And the chucks are out of sight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight

It's Western swing and waltzes
Like to wear out your boots
It's horsehair floors, and Louis L'Amour
After they close the chutes
When they've rode up all the rank ones
And the chucks are out of sight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight
It's Western swing and waltzes
In Saskatchewan tonight

// I Ride An Old Paint: Leavin' Cheyenne //

I ride an old paint, I lead an old Dan
I'm goin' to Montana, for to throw the Houlihan
Where they feed in the coulees and they water in the draw
And their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw

Ride around them dogies, ride around them slow
They're fiery and snuffy and rarin' to go

Now old Bill Jones had two daughters and a song
One went to college and the other went wrong

And his wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight
But still he sings from mornin' till night

Ride around them dogies, ride around them slow
They're fiery and snuffy and rarin' to go

When I die, take my saddle from the wall
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall
Tie my bones to the saddle, turn our faces toward the West
We'll both ride the prairie that we love the best

Ride around them dogies, ride around them slow
They're fiery and snuffy and rarin' to go

Goodbye old paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne
Goodbye old paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne
Leavin' Cheyenne, going to Montana
Goodbye old paint, I'm leaving Cheyenne
Ride around old paint, I'm leavin' Cheyenne

// Big Iron //

To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip"
"Big iron on his hip"

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Well, the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watchin' from the windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather 'fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Though he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

// Henry And Sam //

Have you met my friend Henry?
Have you met my friend Sam?
One's long and lean, one's short and mean
Known quite well throughout this land

Have you heard my friend Henry?
Have you heard my friend Sam?
One's low and barks, one's quick and sharp
Known quite well throughout this land

I'd be dead if not for Henry
I'd be dead if not for Sam
They've spoke with those who've stood opposed
To the way I deal, the way I am

Grown to dislike my friend Henry
Grown to despise my friend Sam
Too many times I've lost my mind
Felt them in my trembling hands

// Diamond Joe //

There is a man you'll hear about
Most everywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe
And he carried all of his money
In a diamond-studded jar
And he never was much bothered
By the process of the law
And I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
I did offer him my hand
And he give me a string of horses
So old they could not stand
And I like to starve to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe

Well, his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat I could not chaw
And he drove me near distracted
With the waggin' of his jaw
And the tellin' of his stories
I mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe
Now, I tried three times to quit him boys
But he did argue so
That I'm still punchin' cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe
And when I'm called up yonder
And it comes my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe

// High & Mighty //

Tom Taylor's colt from Candiac
Has made his marks in cowboy tracks
Buckin' down the best at Calgary
A pet stud colt that liked to buck
Changing lots of cowboy luck
Snapping high and hard and wild and free

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's High and Mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

Three years spent sent out bareback
Trailed and rodeoed in the slack
Till Brown and West put a saddle on one day
It lit the fuse for down the road
From the chute now he'll explode
Let the cowboys scatter where they may

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's High and Mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

He's hot-branded one-oh-eight
Pull down your hat and throw the gate
Brown and West's six year old's the best
He can take you through the door or he can put you on the floor
High and mighty of the golden west

And we said let's change his name to High and Mighty
He bucks higher than he should
And he's mighty hard to ride
And on a saddle bronc that's high and mighty
If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

If he can't buck you off, you've learned to ride

// Talkin' Prairie Boy //

Talkin' prairie boy

Buddy's old man is back on the booze
He's swinging a driver at a big bull moose
That keeps getting on the goddamn property
Or so he says

Cigarettes are expensive and whiskey ain't cheap
And winters are bitter but the summers are sweet
And you can get some modestly priced smokes over at the Rez
If you're so inclined

Most of my time is spent in a big blue van
Just traveling the country with a five piece band
Pick a little for the folks and sing when I can
Granted I'm sober

And other days are for meant for chorin'
Just workin' at the ranch to stave off boredom
And keeping the calves from finding new ways to keel over
Just living the dream

I was cooling my heels down in Tennessee
Post 82, some buddies and me
And we were shooting the shit till we ran out of ammunition

Some dude overheard from across the room
Instead of minding his own he'd just as soon
Sit down next to us and join in on the conversation

Brought over some kinda beer
Something called a I-P-A

East Nashville kid in a cowboy hat
And he couldn't tell a shoe lace from a lariat
And the furthest west he'd ever been is Ohio

He's talking at me, says he's looking for work
And he don't mind getting some dirt on his shirt
And would I be so kind as to hire him on, well, oh, my oh
Surprised he didn't bring a resume

He says If you're doing fence then I ain't for hire
And if you're doing hay, then frankly, I wouldn't conspire
To ask me about doing that either

I said what are ya good for? He said plenty
I could see this conversation wasn't going any which way
And figured I'd do well to leave here
So long buddy
You can keep your IPAs

Yeah, this city life's sure got me tired
And it's hard for a prairie boy to admire all the
Concrete and the towering skyscrapers

So just as soon as I'm able to find my hat
I believe I'll leave and head on back
Home where the tallest buildings are all grain elevators
Long gone to Saskatchewan

Yeah, I'm outta this place and bound for the farm
I ain't taking no greenhorn along
I have a hard enough time just keeping track of myself

If you're in Nashville trying to look cool
But ya can't tell a pretty palomino from a mule
Take my advice and leave the buckaroo hat on the shelf

// Cowpoke //

I'm lonesome but happy
Rich but I'm broke
And the good Lord knows the reason
I'm just a cowpoke

From Cheyenne to Douglas
The ranges I know
Cause I drift with the wind
No one cares where I go

I ain't got a dime
In these ol' wore out jeans
So I'll stop eating steak
And go back to beans

I'll pick up a ten spot
In Prescott I know
Ridin' the broncs
In the big rodeo

Some evening in springtime
A filly I'll find
And I might spend all summer
With her on my mind

But I'll never be branded
And never be broke
I'm a carefree, range riding
Drifting cowpoke

// Rocky Mountain Rangers //

Unfit was I for the Scarlett Mounties
Dandy dude townies, dsrunkard down and outies
But I knowed some boys that I once called family
Mounted high in the year of '85

Major Stewart went down and he left his cows
Back in Fort McLeod when the news circled 'round
That the Métis had enough and there's rustlers on the prowl
And Assiniboia needs us boys to straighten her out

Rocky Mountain Rangers, riding o'er the plains
Serve all the western Calvalry, there's none any stranger
Rocky Mountain Rangers well equipped for danger
Mounted high in the year of '85

One evenings patrol on cypress hills
We drank up our fill and the hour was still
When a Winchester shot like the ringing of a bell
Some boys of Gabriel Dumont's are shooting us to hell

So it's raise up your six-guns, lest we be undone
Rake some fur, slack them reins, let your ponies run, run
How I survived I may never understand, son
Wooly times in the year of '85

Rocky Mountain Rangers, riding o'er the plains
Serve all the western Calvalry, there's none any stranger
Rocky Mountain Rangers well equipped for danger
Mounted high in the year of '85

Disbanded in the year of '85

// Houlihans At The Holiday Inn //

One month on the road will leave you wondering
How any man could ever want for more

But three months on the road will leave you stumbling
Falling through another hotel door

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn

Highwayside grazing herd of cattle
Folks 'round here pulled in a decent yield

A view best taken in from the saddle
I'm staring through this dirty, cracked windshield

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn

If I'm paid well, a tale I'll tell and sing
And I seldom pay a cent for my drinks
Folks in here tonight they think I'm a king
I'd trade it all for a double rigged saddle and good pair of chinks

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
