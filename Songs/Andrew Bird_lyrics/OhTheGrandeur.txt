// Candy Shop //

Well piece by piece, and nail by nail
It'll all come down some day before the fires of hell

You let me in your house
You let me in your house
You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone
I'm going to set fire to your glamor

Well listen now, rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop, set it on fire
Run away and watch it burn
I've got to set fire to your glamor

Rock that candy shop, rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop, set it on fire
Run away, watch it burn
Smell the ashes in the air
Of this silly game we're sure to tire

Well, you let me in your house
You let me in your house (With your mama)
You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone
I'm going to set fire to your glamor
Yes, to your glamor
Yes, little mama, to your glamor
To your glamor
Let it rock
Listen to me now, let it rock, let it rock, now
Rock that candy shop

// Tea & Thorazine //

I can tell by the way you take your infusion
you've spent some time in a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
they let you keep your etch-a-sketch

you laugh like a banshee gesticulate your delirium
they treat you like a corpse keep you full of candy lithium
what a dream life would seem if if you could see
the world from inside an etch-a-sketch

I can tell by the way you reach your conclusions
you're the director of a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
it hadn't been for Doctor B.

animate yourself an alternate reality
consummate a self-pleasing artificiality
you can have yourself a tea

I can tell by the way you take your infusion
you've spent some time in a mental institution
oh what a dream life would be if only...
they let you keep your etch-a-sketch

// Wishing For Contentment //

Wishing for contentment, hoping for relentment
venting my resentment on the happy few

Awaiting resolution, and dreams of restitution
finding retribution's just another thing to do

You've got to keep yourself busy, visit Aunt Lizzy
just see how she's been
But when you're making a late run
two judgmental matrons retort, see what I mean?

A seeming reprobation, perhaps it's my vocation
a nauseous elation comes to mind but it fades so soon

// Wait //

Wait, don't go too early
You're tired but everyone's tired
But no one, no one is tired enough
Only wait a little and listen
Music of hair, music of pain
Music of looms weaving all our loves again
Be there to hear it, it's your only chance
You know that hair will become interesting
And pain, pain will become interesting
Second hand gloves will become lovely, lovely again
Oh wait, wait for now - ooh
Distrust everything, if you have to
But trust the hours
Haven't they carried you everywhere till now?

Music of hair, music of pain
Music of looms weaving all our loves again
Be there to hear it, it's your only chance
Won't you be there to hear it, it's your only chance
Won't you be there to hear it, it's your only...chance

// The Idiot's Genius //

Viridian green
Was the color that triggered
The relapse that brought on
The idiot's genius,

Viridian green was
Mossy and seamless,

The insidious dream
Was white lighted arenas
Intolerable boredom
That washed, peeled, and cored him
Incalculable fear, invertible spheres,

Insidious dream was
The idiot's genius

// Vidalia //

There was a time when I enjoyed vidalia
there was no other fruit I dared my lips to touch
my grandad he prescribed vidalia
"for whatever ails ya" - heart disease, the grippe and such

But to yourself this medicine you'll properly expose
the benefits of health, wealth, and respect
Eat it like an apple of a deep-colored rose
sweet victory will be yours to delect

But how my palate grows tired
so sweet, so sweet, so sweet
no thanks I'll take defeat

I remember a dark and smoky den
Cheeks of roast beef bloody rare
Oh, whiskey-edged faces of barrel-chested men
And I'm feelin' small, weak and scared

I remember that nook, the way I shook
pain hurts innocence be damned
red with shame and red with pain
we all sit down to eat our leg of lamb
our leg of lamb...
we all sit down to eat our leg of lamb

// Beware //

Step right on up, take a good good look
At the latest pie that fate could cook
This is no phenom, no supermarket guru
Just a revelation from me to you
So don't believe a thing that you might hear
At least from the last 30 - 40 years
'Cause it wasn't long ago, just before the reign of Nero
We had no concept of zero
So beware, children beware, the devil may care
Six little soldiers with stripes on their shoulders
Never with a thought to dare
So take aim, children, take aim
The drill sergeant sang
With ample perspiration ordered
"Stop your respiration"
And end the flow of oxygen to the brain
So wake up sleepyheads, listen what I have to say
As you near, near your independence day
Just keep in mind, in time you'd find so few
Have your best interests in mind
So don't believe a thing you might hear
At least from the last 30 - 40 years
'Cause it wasn't long ago, just before the reign of Nero
We had no concept of zero (none at all)
So beware
The devil may care
And maybe he's the only one

// Dora Goes To Town //

She's got a ham in her handbag, a pig in her purse
She's got two-ply no-fly baby buggers
She's got a burlap sack, she's on a voter parade
She's gonna get some carob cigars and some lemonade
No need to put your ear to the ground
Dora Munch is coming to town

She puts eggs in her orange juice, coffee in her tea
Puts olives in her jelly, says that's the way it's gonna be
Ashes and mashes and dust and mustard
Creamed spinach sandwich and she cuts the crusts off
Don't let it show that you wanted some
Dora Munch is coming to town

She's got a ham in her handbag, a pig in her purse
She's got two-ply no-fly baby buggers
She's got a burlap sack, she's on a voter parade
She's gonna get some carob cigars and some lemonade
No need to put your ear to the ground
Dora Munch is coming to town

She puts eggs in her orange juice, coffee in her tea
Puts olives in her jelly, says that's the way it's gonna be
Ashes and mashes and dust and mustard
Creamed spinach sandwich and she cuts the crusts off
Don't let it show that you wanted some
Dora Munch is coming to town, yes sir
Dora Munch is coming to town, you heard me the first time
Dora Munch is coming to town

// Feetlips //

Feetlips, why do you do that way?
You know you'll have to pay
for your making us nauseous

Feetlips, you know today's the day
you turn the other way
and you eat your galoshes

you thought Somepeople was a tragic name
he was the easiest one to blame
his weather systems tempered and tame
till you catch wind of...

Feetlips...you're so brash
waltzing around talking your trash
no, you haven't been drinking
you just talk without thinking
it's what got you this far
but it's not worth one dollar
no it's not a boy
quiet...quiet...quiet...quiet...quiet...quiet...quiet...

Feetlips, why do you do that way
you know you'll have to pay...

Feetlips

// (What's Your) Angle? //

I've got a new-found fangled fandango tango angle
and it keeps things curious yes, and it makes folks furious

it takes two part tango and a little tingle tangle
and two orangutans like me and you

I used to think that you were a tomboy
hair like a bird's nest, clothes so shoddy
then I found that you were arhomboid
not an oblesque bone in your body

So don't mess around with my extemporangle fangle
everybody's entitled to a little existenstialrangle fangle bang

// The Confession //

Don't tell me anything...anyhow
your contribution, proposed solution fails for now
cause I can see your house from here
now the leaves have fallen, dear
you're such a little privateer
as your confession draws mor enear

Don't sell me anything...of any kind
your one time offer is so uncalled for
you call it piece of mind
but I don't want your life insurance
home auto health fire insurance
just make this basic inference
employs a little common sense

Time and again I find I'm listless or rather fistless
in time that's what I find
Carry me to Mecca with what you may devine
take me with you, take me with you, don't leave me behind

Don't tell me anything...anyhow
your trite donation, commercialization
won't hold water now
'cause I can see your ship from here
now the weather's bright and clear
you're such a little privateer
as your confession draws near
