// Captive Of The Sun //

My misophonia brought the faders up
Now she's a military grade
In Dolby Surround, around 5.1
Cue the barking from the baritone
Conductor in the pit for the car honk duet
Half-tone harmony from the sewer
Rebel youth choir belt phrases even newer
Dump truck man drops the beat with trash cans
Call 911! We got therapy demands
Philharmonic got a first chair car crash
Pan the falsetto to smash the glass
It's a drive-by lullaby that couldn't get worse
A melody abandoned in the key of New York

Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer
Hanging from the rafters
I don't get out
I don't have fun
Living like a captive of the sun

[Bun B:]
So I gotta put my shades on
Riding through the city as I gets my escalade on
Flipping down the streets that my reputation was made on
King of the city, the mayor finna put a parade on
Drop the confetti from off the rooftop
While I come down candy and let my roof drop
I got a baddie shotgun in a tube top
With some daisy dukes on and some tube socks
Listening to 2Pac
You ain't know I do rock records
I do it all
I got my hands in some cookie jars
You ain't knew at all
I took a chance and threw caution up in the wind
Cuz I got nothing to lose but got something to win
We throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks
It's gon' end up being a bomb or being the shit
They said the fix was in, guess we'll know when it's done
Until then we'll just be captives of the sun

Sight read the chart
Clap the rocks into sand
A 12-pass van on a pot-hole band stand
Got an oil can hangover by default
And trucks pave the roads with amphetamine salt
Skull shaking cadence of the J train rolls
The rhythm of defeat, repeating like a pulse
Marching on and static, lyrics shout a retort
To the melody abandoned in the key of New York

Where nothing comes after
I'm a passtime streamer
Hanging from the rafters
I don't get out
I don't have fun
Living like a captive of the sun

// Free Ice //

Stolen vodka, purchased limes
Kept in bottles of free ice
I don't recall where we got the salt
But the juice came out of friend's advice
You know the dirt ain't dirt in California
She laughed "it's more like golden dust"
But I've been there before and there's a bridge
It's made of gold but the gates still rust

I made up everything I knew
When I wondered something about you
Favorite times of day and favorite foods
I wish I knew more than I do

// Goofy vs Pluto //

I got a friend with a family
And a friend who's in my family
Got a friend who's walking
And a friend who does the walking
Got a friend who could be clever
I've been wondering forever
Is there an answer out there somewhere?

Are they
One and the same
Or what?

I got a friend with manners
Depending who the man is
Got a friend who questions
All of my perceptions
I've been wondering forever
The status distinction
Between my comparable companions

Are they
One and the same
Or not?

I got a friend who worries
And he's always in a hurry
Got a friend who is impatient
In certain situations
Got a friend with obligations
He goes where [?] will take him

// Hey Bug //

I was told to be careful of what you give away
I wish they said, "Be careful what you say"
Accumulated feelings like dust-covered possessions
I've seen the last until you let them go
Hey bug, spread thy wings and fly into my heart
It seems as if I've trapped you there again
Like embers floating solely in a big glass jar
The instance it escaped it shed your skin, it shed your skin

And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's louder than ever and I hear it because
Everything around it seems to sway with the buzz
Brightened and delighted like the prey that I was
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug!

Do you hear that sound or is it in my head?
Hey bug, hey bug, I didn't see you there
Always through the window, [?]
I fail the hear where it begins or ends
Hey bug, crawl on top of me but don't attach
Always at a distance and so hard to catch

And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's louder than ever and I hear it because
Everything around it seems to sway with the buzz
Brightened and delighted like the prey that I was
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug!

// Smart Aleck Kid //

Over the prison to the sea
Like none of those pursue a craft
Apathy and anger are the same
Nasal burning time to try it
I need something to clear the air
And all I've ever thought to do is sing
My guy cheated on something or another
Everything is calling and a shame
Elbows drawn by risen pain
Heater with my added space
Anyone that laughed at will get brained

All it's gonna take is a word to a gal
All it's gonna take is a word to a gal
For the smart aleck kid
For the smart aleck kid

Getting on like [?] rabbits
[?] by the quarter gallon
If it's down to something I feel lame
Have a bagel, drink a tea
A banana would be good for me
Like all that [?] that you think it was a
P.A.R.T. Why? Cos I gotta
Feel like I'm doing something right
Start a fight is not ideal
But ruining something with a handle of
Bourbon or a shoe, that would be nice!

All it's gonna take is a word to the gal
All it's gonna take is a word to the gal
For the smart aleck kid
For the smart aleck kid

// Watching Strangers Smile //

Watching strangers smile
Never knew it was a privilege
Until the white fearful eyes was all I saw
Filling out forms as the whole music loops
Now I've been trapped inside for weeks on end
My knees, my back, my brain all start to bend

City music makes me want to lose my mind
Like when it taunts me through the bite of summer evenings
Walk out the door to the store, buy a beer
And I'm so paranoid my mask will slip
I just can't seem to get a goddamn grip, a grip, a grip

Do you think about book and letter?
Make the effort that you won't
Do you have 20/20 vision?
I don't
