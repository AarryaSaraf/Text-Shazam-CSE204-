// I Am The Sun //

And I am the sun
I rise above the world
And when the light goes out
I kill another child
And I am insane
I crawl into your mouth
I grow like a flower
I grow a suicide
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
And I am the light (I love everyone)
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

And I am the dog
I cut out my eyes
Yeah I will nullify
My true love creation
And I am the sun
I love everyone
I live inside your chest
I grow like a cancer
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

I love everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone
(I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone)

// She Lives! //

Now I just want to thank you
For going insane
Every second you suffer
Is a loss that I gain
Every breath is a drain down
Down into a hole
And your mind is a shrinking thing
It was crushed by your skull
Now you feel time unfolding
Deep in your chest
And your body's expanding
Now there's none of you left
So I just want to thank you
For losing your mind
Yeah you burned just like Joan of Arc
Purified by the flames
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive

And I just want to thank you
For the light that you spread
And magnesium and sulphur
And the fear in your head
And I just want to tell you
You're nothing so new
Every time that you touch it
It'll turn against you
Now your future's a cold thing
Down in the damp ground
And your memory's a lead room
Containing this sound
So I just want to thank you
For killing your mind
All the life that you bleed out
Well I steal it for mine
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive, you're alive
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive

// Celebrity Lifestyle //

The secret sign of a charmed existence
Is the shiny liquid on her lips
And the ecstasy that comes with her image grows
From the power that the money gives
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
She's just floating in space
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
All her children want a suck and a taste of
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle
Yeah, her celebrity life
And she's just a drug addiction
And a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind

The secret wisdom of 120 days
Is hidden deep in between her legs 
And sexual transcendence is reserved for the wealthy 
But is only one joy that money can make, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she's got a glowing white face, yeah
She's got a celebrity lifestyle 
And she ties her naked children up with wires and lace 
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle is the
Product of a celebrity mind, yeah
Oh, her celebrity mouth is the
Perfect image of the end of time

Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle
Oh my celebrity fear
Oh my celebrity lifestyle

There's a place in space
Where violence and love
Collide inside 
And solid is wide
And heat is cold
And birth is death
And creation and time
Are made from destruction
From fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
