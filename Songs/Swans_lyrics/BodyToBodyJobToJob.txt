// Half Life //

Permission is bloodless
Ambition is senseless

Don't make a wrong move
Work with a purpose
Work with a purpose

You win or you lose
Imitate a slave

Don't make a wrong move
Learn from experience
Learn from experience

Don't be useless
Waste is obscene, waste is obscene, waste is obscene

Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move

// Job //

Cut off the arms
Cut off the legs
Cut off the head
Get rid of the body
Get rid of the body

// Cop //

The punishment fits the crime
Nothing beats humiliation
Humiliation's a disease
Nothing beats humiliation
Nothing beats them like a cop with a club
Nothing beats them like a cop in jail
Nothing beats their heads like a cop with a club
Nobody beats their heads in like a cop in a jail
Nobody hurts them like a cop with a club
Nobody beats them like a cop with a club
Nobody rapes them like a cop with his club
Nothing hurts them like a cop when he's done
Nobody beats him like a cop in jail
Nobody burns him like a cop with a match
Nobody burns their bodies like a cop in jail
Nobody burns their skin like a cop with a match
Nobody has as much fun as a cop
The heat hurts
Humiliation's a disease

Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurts
Heat hurts, hurts, hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurt, heat hurt
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt

// Thug //

The only real thing is misery
Submission means you get murdered
You get revenge when you wait for it
Frustrated means you're insane
He's a dead thing under the sheet
Causing pain
Sex turns impotence into decay
Unconscious repression degrades the real thing
Causing the pain
Causing the pain
You can't kill a criminal need
When you're polluted with fear you need comfort
You can't kill what you can't see
You can't think what you don't own
You can't rub out what you don't recognize
You don't get what you really deserve
You don't fight if you can't feel it
Obedience pays if you use it right
When you eat your pain you keep your nerves
You degrade yourself when you hide your fear

Use it right, use it right
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right, use it right
Use it right, use it right
Ah, right, use it right
Use it right, use it right
Use it right

// I'll Cry For You //

My paw's in your mouth
I'm on the ground
I'll wipe out my face
I'll cry for you
I'll follow you
You live for me
You ridicule
I'll cry
I'll cry for you
I'll cry
I'll work for you
You use my weakness
To feed yourself
I'll cry for you
I'll cry

// Red Sheet //

Red sheet, red sheet
Red sheet, red sheet
Red sheet, red sheet
Red sheet, red sheet
Red sheet, red sheet
Red sheet, red sheet
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out

Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out
Get out, get out

// Your Game //

Put your knife in me
Walk away
Walk away
Worthless
I'm worthless

I feel nothing for you. I hold myself down. Keep to yourself. You shouldn't touch me. My skin peels off my bones. I'll give you a gift: take the skin from my stomach and stretch it across your face. Look in the mirror: I see myself through your eyes. My body's on the ground behind you. You use it to amuse yourself. When you kick it around the room, you feel the impact of your boot in your stomach. Cry for me. Blame me for the fact you no longer recognize yourself. Lying here, I want the air in this room to consume me, to pull my body in behind itself while you stare down at me uncertain if you've lost yourself in me.

You're running your hands along the leather surface of your skin. The sound this makes changes pitch according to the area of your body you touch. Your thighs and your groin generate a low hum – the sound of my corpse releasing dead air when you kick me. Your face generates a continuous high pitched squeal – the sound I make when you burn me. I take you over. You forget yourself in my body. When you chew a piece of skin from your finger, you remember my body in your mouth, my bones cracking between your teeth. I love you. When you lick your hand your sweat tastes like my blood. Conceal yourself. Close yourself off. Pull back into my skin. I'm inside you. The place on the floor where my body decayed left a stain on your memory. That's the signature of my love for you. You can't forget me without losing yourself. I'll never die.

// Seal It Over //

This is my home
Close it over
Weigh your heart
I can't see you, I can't see you

Take one step
Stop
Talk to talk
I can't see you

Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over

Watch your face
I can't see you

Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over
Seal it over

// Whore //

You're too close
I don't recognize your smell
You're in the wrong skin
I don't recognize your smell
Your mouth smells strange
Some people want to kill you
Some people want to fuck you
When you say the wrong word
You could be shitting yourself
When you act the wrong way
When you do the wrong thing
You could be shitting yourself
Don't be a whore
You could be shitting yourself

// Mother, My Body Disgusts Me //

Mother, don't come near me
Near me
Mother, you disgust me
I need my greed, mother,
I need my greed, mother,
Mother, my body disgusts me
I need my greed,
Mother, my scents disgust me
Mother, your body disgusts me
I hate my greed
I hate my greed, mother
I hate your smell
You disgust me
I need your dirty smell
I hate my greed
I need your dirty hands on me [x4]
You disgust me [x3]
I need your dirty hands on me
I need my greed
I need your dirty hands on me
Mother, you disgust me

// Raping A Slave (Live Berlin 1984) //

Why be ashamed of hatred?
There's nothing wrong with burning

You do what you want
You cut out my heart

I work hard for everything I own
Everything I own chokes me when I sleep

You do what you want
You burn out my heart

Why be ashamed of burning?
Why be ashamed of burning?

You burn out my heart
Then you eat out my heart
And you cut out your heart
And you burn out your heart
Then you burn it out

Oh, burn out
Oh, why?
Why be ashamed of your hatred?
Why? Why? Why?
Why be ashamed of your blood?
When you burn, when you burn it out
When you eat my heart
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, be ashamed, oh be ashamed
Burn out, please burn it out
Oh, please!
Shut it out

You burn it
Then eat it
You burn it
Then you eat it
Then you burn it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Why?
