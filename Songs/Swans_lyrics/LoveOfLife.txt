Album: LoveOfLife

// Love Of Life //

For the love of life
For the love of life
In the light of life
In the love of light

And the strong survive
For the love of life
And the strong will rise
In the endless light

For the blood of life
For the love of life
In the bloodless light
For the love of life

In the blood is light
In the light is life
For the love of life
For the love of life

In the endless light
In the blood of life
Now the strong will rise
For the love of light

In the bloodless light
Now the strong survive
For the love of life
For the blood of life

And the heavens come
For the strongest ones
In a universe
Made of blood and love

In the blood is light
In the light is life
For the love of life
For the love of life

// The Golden Boy That Was Swallowed By The Sea //

And the endless crowds of people
They walk upon this stone
Where will their memory go
Where did their minds come from
And I was only a child
When I first looked in your eyes
And saw your body rise over the ocean

We saw the golden boy bleed love
Onto the sand like rain
While we were injecting colours
Into our open veins
And deep beneath the water
The dead black silence crawled

Far away across the ocean
The golden boy's beneath the sea
The golden boy swallowed by the sea

And love is sometimes violent
And violence has no constraint
And I can see inside you
Yes, I can feel what you think
And with this knife of silver
I will release your soul
And throw it out into the ocean

Nine million miles in a straight line
In a place just like this
In a ship on the water
Where no dimensions exist
My hands are holding your picture
And the image, it shifts
I tear it up and scatter it over the ocean
...The golden boy that was swallowed by the sea

// The Other Side Of The World //

I won't think it
I won't speak it
But I feel it
And I see it

And it comes down and surrounds us
With sensation
With perfection
Without purpose

And there's colour
And there's light
And there's movement
On the other side of the world

With each movement
New reactions cause sensations
Which move through us
And the warm wind kissed your body

And the sun was rising on the other side of the world
And there's colour
And there's light and sensation
On the other side of the world

Now I breathe it
And I see it before thinking
And it's perfect
Without purpose

And there's colour
And there's light
And they're rising
On the other side of the world

// Her //

I'll walk with you
Through space and time
And when sleep is near
I will fold you in

I'll disappear with you
In clear blue flames
And when our time arrives
We will slide through space

// The Sound Of Freedom //

We're standing by a river
In a place where nothing moves
And the white light in the sky
Is meaningless and cruel

And we turn our face away
From a cold and violent wind
And we bow our heads down
And we pray to the sound of freedom

With a mirror in my hand
And my eyes burned in the fire
Drunk on self-deception
And punished by desire

Leaping directly into a bright white sea
I'll keep myself breathing
And I'll swallow the sound of freedom

Nobody else can see you
Nobody knows how you feel
Go further inside you
Where nothing else is real

Now throw yourself into a pool of silence you can see
And hold the mirror before your eyes
And light the white light
It's the sound of freedom

Now time is just a picture
That moves before your eyes
And every lie that I believe
Is falsely compromised

And this is not a sound
And we are not alive
Someone else was here before
In someone else's mind

And the ground we walk is sacred
And every object lives
And every word we speak
Will punish or forgive

And the light inside your body
Will shine through history
Set fire to every prison
Set every dead man free

And the air we're breathing now
We breathed a million times
And the darkest dreams we dreamed
Were dreamed by other minds

So take us to the water
Take us to the sound
And wash my soul away
Where it can never be found

And the white light that surrounds us
Is the sound of freedom pounding
And the ground that opens up
Spits the fire from freedom's mouth

And the concrete, glass and steel
Break with a freedom you can feel
And the wind that blows through Heaven
It screams the sound of freedom

And the violence that destroys
Is the birth of freedom singing
And the lovers in the field
Make the sound of freedom bleeding

And the pain that eats my mind
Is the shout of freedom's life
And the sea that splits in two
Is the cut of freedom's knife

And the fire that burns this city
Is the white light in freedom's eye
And the white light is the sound of freedom

// Identity //

Now I'm breathing the breath of God
And the cold wind cleans my mind
And I'm standing in a ring of fire
And my heart is made of light

And I fly across the red mountains
And my hands contain the sky
And the earth rolls away in darkness
And I ride a piece of lightning
Killing time
Killing time

Now they punish our imagination
And corrupt our blood with fear
And infinity's beneath the ocean
But oblivion sits right beside me here

So we are blind and we're polluted
And each breath is drunk with tears
We'll drift away across tomorrow
And we'll ride the breath of nothing through the years
Killing time
Killing time

// In The Eyes Of Nature //

No, we have never been here
And we will never be gone
I saw your voice rise up
And cut into the heart of the sun

I kissed the lips of a girl
She took her first breath when this world was young
I felt the cold of the air
As it burned my empty lungs

And we have never been born and we will be consumed
And unreality is buried here beneath the truth
And though we've never been here, we will never be contained
And unreality is naked here beneath the moon

So we'll go down to the ocean
And wash our memory clean
We'll see the world for the first time
Through an unburied eye

And though the world will stay the same
And we're certain to die
We'll raise our hands up to Heaven
And sacrifice our limitations

And the pain and frustration
Are equal to the bliss of release
And in the eyes of nature
We will live for an eternity

And when we die, we'll disappear
Into the eyes of nature
And we are here just for a little while
And then our body disappears

Into the eyes of nature
Into the arms of God
Into the mouth of indifference
Into the eyes of nature

And we are nothing but experience
In the eyes of nature
And we will live forever
In the eyes of nature

// She Crys (For Spider) //

You can hear them out there
They're gonna follow you down
On the rocks
In the air
Inside your mind, they made you scared
Of all the lies that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up
The seeds you have sown

So hold on and make it last
Hold on for your last holy breath
Hold on for your faith
It has lapsed

Those cries like an acid
They will eat through your mask
Those cries like a hammer
They will nail down your past
Those cries gonna swallow up
Your last dying gasp

You can hear them out there
They come inside and ride you slow
They come inside where they will grow
Without a hope, without a dream
Without anything
Without a demon to turn the key

Of all the lies now that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up the seeds you have sown
Those cries gonna get ya, chill you down to the bone
Those cries like an acid they will eat through your mask
Those cries gonna swallow up your last dying gasp

So hear them now
All the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives and just grown old
So hear the cries from the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives
Now they're turning cold

// God Loves America //

And all across America
The poison fires glow
And in the blood of our procreation
Annihilation grows

Yes, love was made for slaves like us
Designed to fetishize
Consumption, waste and an identity
Based on a dying lie

So God forgive America
The end of history is now
And God may save the victim
But only the murderer holds real power

We came across the seas
We'd fill with offal and disgust
And any object industry required
We bought, enslaved or we crushed

And now our minds are as naked
As the paradise we stripped
And our reward is our entropy
Our emptiness is our gift

So God forgive America
And every human on this Earth
And God forgive the ruined lives
And nothing is what it's worth

// No Cure For The Lonely //

She'll go down there to nowhere soon
She'll stand there still with her head in the moon
I will be her nowhere man
Where I'll remain until the end

That girl was so much better than me
But it always goes wrong
There's no cure for the lonely
With loneliness she'll sink in the sand
I feel the heat go out of her hand

We were born with our face to the wall
We only have one chance to crawl
When we laid down there, I held your hand
I'll never feel your body again

Cut down the preacher, he just lies
Burn all the books that closed my mind
Destroy it all, it's all untrue
How can I even breathe without you?
