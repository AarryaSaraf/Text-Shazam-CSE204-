// Please, Please, Please //

You know... former shoeshine boy from a very, very poor family
My father, that worked hard all his life
And we "moved from pillar to post", is what the people used to say
Never really had home
I can... as far back as I can remember, it was always renting
Paying another cash bills, and never really paying home
And this is a... tune, I guess probably mean more to me
Than anything, that uh... I've ever been involved in
And I figured that I should come back and really, really sing it
With all the success I've had, and as good as people have been to me
I wanna show them, that I still have
My real heart, my real soul, my real feelin'
But when you start doing things with people, you um...
Hesitance to keep it up and, and love what you're doing
Because you know you're doing something good, to say
As God looked down on you and smiled
And uh... I always look back and say, you know
"I've done something good"
So I wanna get the fellas started off here...
That, and all the fellas in that control room
And it makes me feel good, start it off fellas, kick it off

(Please, please, don't go)
Please, please, please
(Please, please, don't go)
Honey please, don't go
(Ohhh...) Girl, girl, I love you so
(Please, please, don't go) Lord, have mercy

Baby, you've done me wrong
(Please, please, don't go)
Baby, baby baby baby
You've done me wrong
(Please, please, don't go)
You know you've done, done me wrong
(Ohhh...) Oh, oh yeah
Took my love, and now you're gone
(Please, please, don't go)

Wanna stand up and sing it, like I used to sing it

People of New York, all of my brothers and sisters
Don't go (ohhh...) oh, oh yeah
I love you so
(Please, please, don't go)
I wanna dedicate this especially to
My son [?], who's gone home, Teddy Brown

// So Long //

So long, hope we'll meet again some day
Hope that maybe then you'll say
"Darling, I was wrong"

So long, gee, I hate to see you go
You're the world to me you know
You've been mine, so long

All alone with my memories of you
I can see that you're lonely too
You're my own, even though we're far apart
I will keep you right here in my heart

So long, so long
Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long

Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long

// (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons //

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you, and you alone were meant for me
Please, give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
