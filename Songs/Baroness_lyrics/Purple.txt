Album: Purple

// Morningstar //

Far beyond horizons there's a master in martyr's disguise
Pale as the Morningstar
Strung to the sky

Never mind the altars
Or the crooks in their saintly attire
All of us tinder-wood
Bound for the fire

Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done

Release the hounds my lady
Let 'em tear at the moon and the stars
Torment the heavens
And laugh at the sky

Dry your tears my darling
There's a pistol-whipped look in your eyes
The captain was gentle
He left you alive

Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done

Could you lay me down with my someone
To carry the weight
The damage I have done

// Shock Me //

In a battle, you only brought your shield
I picked the nearest blade I found
To meet you in the field
I'm sure that I told my fair share of lies
If not, I bent the truth
But good fortune never was shining on me
The way it shone on you

Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me, I needed a surprise

In a dream, a great calamity
To stone my heart and firm resolve
And render nerves to steel
The polestar wheeled about my head
Until such time it grew
A deep well of despair I found
The day my dreams came true

Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me

Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me, I needed a surprise
Shock me

// Try To Disappear //

I will bury your bones inside my garden
Underneath your eyes can't burn through me anymore

I will throw a golden anchor in the harbor
Tie you by your chain to the ghost on the ocean floor

And as my lungs deflate
You help me suffocate
We have no need to breathe

You tried to disappear
So long
I followed you

Along the eastern banks I ran
'Til no more could I stride
No wing nor cloven hoof
Would let me stay rolling tide

Across the coastal banks she runs
And gallops towards the sea
But I cannot outrun the beast
That bears my sanity

And as my lungs deflate
You help me suffocate
We have no need to breathe

You tried to disappear
So long
I followed you

The world is great and wide
But wherever you go you know
I'm a step behind

Lay that hammer down
If your cross needs a nail I'm sure we can sort it out

If you try to disappear
I'm just around the bend
So long
I followed you

When you try to run and hide
It warms my little heart
So long
I followed you

// Kerosene //

Climbing up the walls again
A constant spinning wheel
Though I made the same mistake
My love is never enough

Spider-webs radiate
Pale electric blue
And I can feel the morning light
Crashing down on you

You'll take your time
I'll take mine
And I'll wait so...patiently

Drown my love in Kerosene
And in the final hour
Absence told my heart to wander away

Lost too long above the stars
Heard the tether snap
I got so high I'm satisfied
I'm never coming back

You'll take your time
I'll take mine
And I'll wait so...patiently

Drown my love in Kerosene
And in the final hour
Absence told my heart to wander away

When I am done I'll lay in the sun
And when I am done I'll lay in the sun

// Chlorine & Wine //

When I called on my nursemaid
Come sit by my side
But she cuts through my ribcage
And pushes the pills deep in my eyes

The taste was much sweeter
Than chlorine and wine
And my doctorâs unable
To cut through cable that leads to my mind

In spite of the winter
Thereâs ways to keep warm
Whatever you give me
Please know that Iâll ask you for more

The day I stopped swimming
And came out of the tide
Iâd never felt so uncomfortably dumb
Here by your side

Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye

Please
Donât lay me down
Under the rocks where I found
My place in the ground
A home for the fathers and sons

Black rose on the bed
Turn me to fire
Black rose in the vein
Shine in your eye

Please
Donât lay me down

// The Iron Bell //

Show me the hill
Show me the gallows pole, the iron bell
Cry me a river
If I could I would leave today

Wake me when I'm dead
There's a thousand devils screaming in my head
Wake me when I'm gone
And I'll tell you when the right outweighs the wrong

That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again

Take me to hell
Show me the gatling-guns and the fireworks
Cry me a river
If I could I'd burn those tears away

Worn down to my bones
There's a thousand miles to go before I'm home
Push me to the edge
I bet you you'll wish you'd done it all along

That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again

That's all you get
I'm bored again
Bored again

Iron bell
Curtain call
Gallows pole
The curtain falls

That's all you get

// Desperation Burns //

I hate to say, but we've looked on better days
It took me by surprise
We left our quiet home behind

The castaways drag the lake
The desperation burns

Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation

You never sang so sweetly 'til you whispered in my ear
I never heard a sound but I could hear
The hatchet-man dusting off his sleeve

Spilt my blood and drank my dreams
And stopped the spinning wheels

Wash away the bitter taste
The desperation burns

Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation

The last one flew
Just out of sight
If it throws you away
Just sit back and enjoy the ride

Raise the alarm
Un-close your eyes
Desperation burns

// If I Have To Wake Up (Would You Stop The Rain) //

Kill the lights! There's something wrong with today
This isn't me
This is on you
All I can say, all I can do is wait

Hold on
We are birds in your hand
Brace yourself
One in the air ten in the sand
Clip my wings and let me fall to you

If I have to wake up
Would you stop the rain
If I try to fly away
Open your arms and
Wake up

Take a dive
Fill your lungs with summer rain
Pace yourself
Heavy the heart steady the hand
One last taste of milk and gasoline

Too long
In a lunatic parade
Aces high
One of a kind ten of a pair
Lifted up and crashing down on you

If I have to wake up
Would you stop the rain
If I try to fly away
Open your eyes
Wake up
Pull me to the ground
If I have to fall down
Let me fall to you

// Crossroads Of Infinity //

[Spoken:]
"I've done it!
I'm drifting into a world of limitless dimensions!"
