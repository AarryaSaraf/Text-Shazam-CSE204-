// Take My Bones Away //

You lead the way
I'll follow...

You lead the way
I'll follow...

What was the plan here? I can't seem to stop
Pissing and spitting from bottom to top
Picking up viscera, tendons and broken remains

Did you find another way?
Was it my turn, or yours, to say?
"Did you find another way?"

Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

I took your advice and the requisite pills
And the forbidden pies from a white windowsill
Swallowing caveats, Baphomet's breath and migraines

Did I tell you "donât come home"?
Why was your mouth beginning to foam?
Did I tell you "don't come home"?

Take my bones away
I'll find them every day

Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away
Take my bones away

// March To The Sea //

There was an anchor 
There was a silver-sweet refrain 
You tucked your fingers in between my troubled bones 
And what you did next was second-to-none 
You really let us down 
You tied yourself up 
And jumped in the sea 
Never to come home 

Valium 
You left me all alone 
Tell me when 
I will be whole again 

There was a whisper 
Once there were heralds and parades 
You sang your secrets through the tolling of the tide 
The fugitive rooms, the amateur tombs 
The silence and cries 
The quickening beat 
Your march to the sea 
Never to return 

Sweet morphine 
Youâve taken all of me 
Let me know 
When you will let me go 

Heroin 
Where did you take my friend? 
Tell me why 
Those ropes are hanging high 

Valium 
You left me all alone

// Little Things //

Cry your eyes out
A lesson left unlearned
I wish I was airborne
Then I could watch it turn

They've taken everything 
Hung us out to dry
They've taken every thing

Playing enemy
This is thought control

You're a greasy little thing
You'll scream before you sing
and you make a lot of noise
You lied about everything
You greasy little thing

I got with the program
I tried to fall in line
I wish I was drowning
Than I could watch you burn

They've taken everything
Hung us out to dry
They've taken every thing
Now you're...

You're  a sneaky little thing
You'll scream before you sing
And you make a lot of noise
You lied about everything
You sneaky little thing

When the tide rolls in 
When the trapdoor starts to swing
When the swans have sung
I'll be myself again

// Twinkler //

Though I stand in mire
I will speak distant fire
Though I'm laid to ground
I will walk through age and sound

Though I stand in mire
I will speak distant fire
Though I'm laid to ground
I will walk through age and sound

// Cocainium //

Seven branches on my window
Waiting for the sun to come around
Take this on an empty stomach
Waiting for the spring to come around

Save yourself
By the way
Never ride alone

Take me down easy
I can't stand the sight or the smell
It's getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tell

Tell me when the blood stops flowing
Let it rest, it's run into the ground
Just in case the dogs are feeding 
Shut the door so they won't hear the sound

Save Yourself
By the way
Never ride alone

Show me no quarter
I can't stand the sight or the smell
It's getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tell

Put me to pasture
I can't stand the sight or the smell
It's getting harder and harder and harder and harder to tell

// Back Where I Belong //

Tell me now
Who's in charge here?
I thought help was on the way
It took so many years to get out of here
Now I'm back where I belong
Now I'm back where I belong
Next to you
Stuck to you

Here's the rub...
There's no difference
Between poison and the cure
When the one tastes so great it's a crying shame
That I'm back where I belong 
Now I'm back where I belong
Next to you
Stuck with you

Say goodnight to your mother
Say a prayer for your father
Wake me when the thunderclouds are rolling in
Take me to a hazy Sunday morning

I heard your eyes and I touched your tongue
When we were kids we never felt so young
Take me to a hazy Sunday morning

I heard your eyes and I touched your tongue
When we were kids we never felt so young
Take me to a hazy Sunday morning

// Sea Lungs //

I can't breathe
Nor can I see the sun
It's so cold in here
Where did I go wrong? 

All these days
I've sail'd cross these wicked seas
and I have petitioned the deep
For water to keep me clean

When my ship comes in
I'll find a way to breathe again

"Breathe in deep
Let the sea fill your lungs
It's better to brace for death
Than die for a promised land"

"Why so sad?
Your tears are no match for mine
I am eternal sea
And you are a drowning man"

When my ship comes in
I'll find a way to breathe again

When my ship comes in
I'll find a way to breathe again

When my ship comes in
I'll find a way to breathe again

// Eula //

Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

When my bones begin to break 
And my head begins to shake 
Itâs my own blood 

When my house becomes a cage 
And the neighbours turn away 
Itâs my own blood 

Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

âWhere the butcherâs hand is homeâ 
Laughs the blade above the throne 
âItâs my own bloodâ 

âOh, this apple makes me sickâ 
Cries the pig upon his stick 
âItâs my own bloodâ 

And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 

And If I had a heart 
Iâd waste it on you 
But itâs all together far too long 
Since I took you down 

Settle down 
This wonât last long 
Iâve been out 
And I want back in 
So why not completely fade away 

When weâve licked all of the lips 
And the salt-stained fingertips 
Itâs our own blood 

When our lambs and lions made 
Debts no righteous man can pay 
Itâs our own blood 

And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue 
And I canât forget the taste 
Canât forget the taste of my own tongue

// Board Up The House //

Take me away from the ocean, I've already gone away
I'm already gone

Take me up north to the blue grass, horse meat and pharmacies
I'm already gone

Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls

We wanted the best for our sweet little September castaway
I'm already gone

She's floating in acetone, covered in bruises and common colds
I'm already gone

Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls
Board up the house
Hide your boys and girls

Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up the house
Board up

Hide your boys...
Hide your girls...
Hide your...

// Mtns. (The Crown & Anchor) //

You're never awake
But you don't seem to sleep at all
Those stolen flowers inside your guts
Will take you away

Steady the hand that lays the child to bed
Barbitals and decay
The crown and the anchor

You'll curse at the sky
Three words for which the boys have no names
How many beasts in the night
To take you away

What quivers and shakes? 
What fills your stomach and clogs your veins? 
Whose claws do scratch at your wooden limbs? 
And tear you away

Steady the hand that lays the child to bed
Barbitals and decay
The crown and the anchor

We will never sleep
We will never wake
We will drift away

We will never sleep
We will never wake
We will drift away

// Foolsong //

That fool who digs his own grave
I'm still trying to find my way out!
But if it's the long way
I'll sleep in this bed I've made

The kids have fallen on blades
It's too late to figure out
It's too late for babies to beg for their beds

It's too late to ignore the storm up ahead
It's too dark to see my way out
Now all I can do about anything wrong
Is dig further down
Further down

When we finally awake
We'll burn our bodies on stakes
A tower of ashes and sawdust will lie
Where our castles were made

// Collapse //

We are all soured milk
When we look in the mirror, we collapse
When our time has come
When our finger's on the trigger, we collapse

Arms are flailing
Swirling like the poison in the sink

Like the southern belle
Playing songs of horror
Like teeth amongst the grass

Like the bullet shell
Whistle and then I'll hum
Watch the good folks run

We are all rotten fruit
When the pipeline starts to flowing, we collapse
When our time has come
When the city needs a lynching, we collapse

Arms are flailing
The devils' in the eye of every man

Water and the well
A Baptist and a baby
Were rolling in the weeds

Keep her spirit well
The tarpit baby's father
Will lay her out to dry

// Psalms Alive //

I am the nail that you can't strike
I am the spear that will run you through

And when the shots were falling we were sound asleep
And you filled your palms with dirty bombs
Instead of hand grenades

I am teeth which cannot bite
I'll tear your garden up by the roots

And when the shots were falling we were sound asleep
And you filled your palms with dirty bombs
Instead of hand grenades

Hear the seven bells toll
Ringing loud for you
Coroners and vultures
Cry out, Gloria! 

All across the valley
Onward towards the sun
The two-bit prophet sways and
Pull a piece from everyone

Feel the heavy hoof-beats
Pound across the land
The sin of our forefathers
Lies within our clutching hands

What the planes pass over
Hear it's call-to-arms
The golden drunk of morning 
Made me straight my bended knee

// The Line Between //

I turned my head up and the sky was empty
I wasn't looking for paradise
And when I asked for comfort from the land of plenty
I came to realize...

You have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away

Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone

I thrust my hands in 'til the nerves went cold
I tasted silver and I tasted gold
And when the bandage lifted, our scars were newborn
We still felt everything

I have taken this for granted
Please don't take it all away

Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone

Feel the light of day, feel it fade away
Walk the line between the righteous and the wicked
And tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow I'll be gone
