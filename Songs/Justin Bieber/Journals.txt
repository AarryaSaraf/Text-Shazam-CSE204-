// Heartbreaker //

Girl, you don't know how I feel, (How I really feel)
Since you been away, oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call? Take my call
If I dialled you today, oh

Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby

Oh girl, I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And, baby, nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker

Girl, you see me standin' here (Standing here)
Standing in the rain, oh baby
Any chance you could stay right here, yeah yeah
And never go away?

Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool
I've been thinkin' about you all day long, hopin' you pick up your phone
Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Oh, girl, I got a secret place that we can go
'Cause I really wanna be alone
And baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker
'Cause, girl, my heart's breaking, heartbreaker

So what I'm really tryna say is
And what I hope you understand
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am
I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk
With everyone being around but
It's just personal, this just, for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you (Girl, you say that you don't wanna talk, but it's cool)
And though the seasons may change
Sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
I'm under this umbrella and I'm callin' your name (Girl, I know that I don't wanna lose your love)
And you know I don't wanna lose that, 'cause I still believe

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know if you feel it, the way that I'm, the way that I'm

And you taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You taught me to be careful with your heart, your heart, with your heart

// All That Matters //

Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long, long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me

// Hold Tight //

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthday

They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Don't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention that thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a Ziploc, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Got me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock, what a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving, it just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like krazy glue, ooh-wee

They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

Oh baby, holding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rock star, making it hard on me
Visualise a monster, cause you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit, need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, no no
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah they hold on tight, ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight, they hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, that hold on tight
Ooh they hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go

// Recovery //

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, whoa

I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don't pay to lie cause I don't wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, whoa

I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I'd see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, whoa

You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right
I'mma do you right
You know I'mma do you right

// Bad Day //

No I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe, yeah
Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life was so unpredictable, yeah
Never thought a love like yours would leave me all alone, oh no
Didn't waste any time
But you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
Cause I was out of line, oh yeah

But I didn't think you would let me
Down that easy, oh no girl
And I didn't think it was over
Until you walked away like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day, hey girl
I knew I was wrong, but you could've said goodbye baby
It was a bad day, now I'm like whoa
It was a bad day, it was a bad day

// All Bad //

It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths

Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood

They try to get at me (they try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back, your back)
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn

Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do

They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad

// Roller Coaster //

Come here
I don't know what happened

Where did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control? (Slow it down)

Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don't know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no flights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
There's a reason what this happened for, yeah (But I can't help but feel like)

Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don't know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

Bounce

Lonely overseas, only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go, baby, they don't know
What we had before, but it fell before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

// Change Me //

Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now
To accept all responsibility

I go out of my way to live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same, oh

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, whoa
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing

Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, whoa
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now

Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, she's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, and I'm down with it

I'm addicted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Something like an addict
Got me twisted (Oh, yeah, yeah)
But still, I gotta have it

Explosive, explosive

Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancin'
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve (Oh?)
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note (Oh?)
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat (IGH! IGH!)
Stay faded like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate when I rock the boat (IGH!)
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll (IGH!)
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" (Ooh!)
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team, IGH!

In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace

[Justin Bieber:]
I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Big Sean:]
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

[Justin Bieber:]
I'd like to give you what you need

Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need

Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

// Flatline //

Flatline, flatline, flatline, flatline

Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know
How come you act so different? Just talk to me I'll listen
All the love I'm giving, don't act like you don't know

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?
She said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now

I was out there on the road, life out of control
She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
Girl you always catch me at the bad time
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline, flatline

Girl you always catch me at the bad time
When I know you probably think it's a lie
I know I told you last time was the last time
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Flatline, flatline
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?

// Alone //

We were inseparable
Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own
