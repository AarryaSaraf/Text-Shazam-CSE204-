// In Hollywood (Everybody Is A Star) //

Take a bus, a train or a plane to Hollywood
Go there and then change your name
You dye your hair out there, it's part of the game
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Tell the bank that you need a loan
Go sell your house and every little thing that you own
You'll make your dream, forget what you've ever known
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Now you're set, so follow the rules
Don't need a house unless it comes with the pool
Buy some new clothes and then you've got to be cool
You're gonna be a star, big star, listen here

Find a beach if you need a tan 
You got to act as though you're in great demand
Be first class, don't ever think second hand
You're gonna be a star, a big star

(In sty-y-y-yle) get in style (L.A. sty-y-y-yle)
(Say hi-i-i-i) saying hi-i-i (as you cruise by-y-y-y)
Listen here ('cause everybody is a star in Hollywood) well
(Everybody is a star in Hollywood) alright

Let's go to (Holly-Hollywood) Hollywood (Holly-Hollywood) so good
(Holly-Hollywood, Holly-Hollywood) come on

Now it's time to get a new car
You know the kind that has a phone and a bar
You'll soon forget the per-son you really are
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Party where the stars have their fun
The Candy Store or Pips or Studio One
Act like a king and soon New-Yorkers look up
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Never run to answer the phone,
just let it ring, pretend you're just getting home,
play a good game, you see you'll never go wrong
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Tell your friends you walked off the stage
Then slip outside and call and have yourself paged
Get on the phone and scream as though in a rage
You're gonna be a star, a big star

(In sty-y-y-yle) be in style (L.A. sty-y-y-yle) L.A. sty-y-y-yle
(Say hi-i-i-i) say hi (as you cruise by-y-y-y) as you cruise by
Listen here ('cause everybody is a star in Hollywood) well
(Everybody is a star in Hollywood) alright

Let's go to (Holly-Hollywood) Hollywood (Holly-Hollywood) so good
(Holly-Hollywood) well (Holly-Hollywood) alright

(Everybody is a star in Hollywood), Hollywood
(Everybody is a star in Hollywood), so good

Studio! (what?), lights (lights), music (music), action (action)
Dance (dance), dance (dance), dance (dance), dance (dance)
