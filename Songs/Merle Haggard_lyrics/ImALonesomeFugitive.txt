// I'm A Lonesome Fugitive //

Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail
I'm a hunted fugitive with just two ways:
Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home

I'm lonely but I can't afford the luxury
Of having one I love to come along
She'd only slow me down and they'd catch up with me
For he who travels fastest goes alone

I'd like to settle down but they won't let me
A fugitive must be a rolling stone
Down every road there's always one more city
I'm on the run, the highway is my home

I'm on the run, the highway is my home

// All Of Me Belongs To You //

All of me belongs to you all the time 
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's no way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me 
That don't miss you through and through
Cause all of me belongs to you

Eyes are worthless cause you're not here to see
Lips're so forgotten since you forgotten me
My arms ached from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me 
That don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you

Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams 
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me 
My heart don't inclue cause all of me belongs to you

Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams 
Searching for a love I lost but can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me 
My heart don't inclue cause all of me belongs to you

All of me belongs to you

// House Of Memories //

My house of memories, is all I own,
I live in misery, now that you're gone.
A constant reminder, of what used to be,
Is torturing me, in my house of memories.

My house is a prison, where memories surround me.
There's no place to hide where you're memory won't find
me.
My house of memories, is all I own,
I'm all alone, in my house of memories.

My house is a prison, where memories surround me.
There's no place to hide where you're memory won't find
me.
My house of memories, is all I own,
And I'm all alone, in my house of memories.
In my house of memories.

// Life In Prison //

The jury found the verdict first degree
They swore I planned her death to be
I prayed they sentence me to die
But they wanted me to live and I know why
So I do life in prison for the wrongs I've done
And I pray every night for death to come
My life will be a burden every day
If I could die my pain might go away
Insane with rage I took my darling's life
Because I loved her more than life
My dreams for her will last a long long time
But I'd rather die than live to lose my mind
But I've got life in prison...
If I could die my pain might go away

// Whatever Happened To Me //

It gets longer in between each time you call
I'd be safe in saying you no longer care at all
We're never seem together like we used to
Be tell me darling whatever happened to me

I once played a big part in your world 
Think back and I know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world
Oh but whatever happened to me

I made up my own excuses for so long
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me

Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me

// Drink Up And Be Somebody //

Well I gotta keep my reputation I gotta keep my pride
Can't let you know you've hurt me I can't let you know I've cried
I gotta make you think I'm happy everywhere I go
I gotta keep my hurt inside me I can't let it show
I gotta drink up and be somebody I have another round
I can't let my troubles find me I gotta keep your mem'ry down
Can't let you drive me crazy can't let you win I gotta drink up and be somebody again
[guitar]
Well I can't spend my whole life grieving I gotta find myself
I gotta put me back together I gotta find me someone else
I don't make you think I'm happy everywhere I go
I gotta keep my hurt inside me I can't let it show
I gotta drink up and be somebody...

// Someone Told My Story //

I played the brand new record on the jukebox
And I scarcely could believe the song I've heard
It told of how you left me for another 
It was almost like I'd written every word

Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you've done me wrong 
Someone told my story in a song

The writer must've seen the way you done me
For he told it all and never missed a line
He told of swinging doors and the jukebox 
And he even knew I almost lost my mind

Someone told my story in a song
The lyrics told of happiness and home
Then it told of how you've done me wrong 
Someone told my story in a song

// Mary's Mine //

Mary's mine and she'll always be till the end of time
She gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love
And Mary's mine

I once lived the life without meaning 
Just the face with no place in this world
At last I found reason for living 
And I owe it all to the love of a girl

Her love gave me reason for living 
To make her happy is first on my mind
Because of her my life has real meaning
I love her so and I know Mary's mine

Mary's mine and she'll always be till the end of time
She gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love
And Mary's mine

No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love 
Cause Mary's mine

// Skid Row //

Well not long ago I was a happy man
Money in my pockets with the rings on my hands
My money's all Gone and I'm feelin' low 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row

My girl friend left me she don't want me no more
We had a great big fight just a night before
She said I got no class because she knows 
I've been hangin' around on Skid Row

Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row

I got an old John Beam with the pain more through
Got a great big hole in the bottom of my shoe
My wine's all gone and I need some more 
Standin' on the corner of Skid Row

Well people walk by and they stop and stare
They giggle and they stickle at the clothes I wear
It's just another day like it always goes 
When you're hangin' around on Skid Row

// My Rough And Rowdy Ways //

For years and years I've rambled
I drank my wine and gambled
But one day I thought I would settle down

I have met a perfect lady
She said she'd be my baby
We built a cottage in the old hometown

But somehow I can't give up
My good old rambling ways
Lord, the railroad trains are calling me away

I may be rough, I may be wild
I may be tough and that's just my style
I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways

But somehow I can't give up
My good old rambling ways
Lord, the railroad trains are calling me away

I may be rough, I may be wild
I may be tough and that's just my style
I can't give up my good old rough and rowdy ways
I pick them blues, boy

// Mixed Up Mess Of A Heart //

Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart

Yeah, I watched her buy her tickets in Charlotte, North Carolina
And I heard her say, "One-way, please, to Denver"
She's goin' to meet that other guy and it won't do us no good to cry
'Cause she's wearin' his ring on her finger

Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
Yeah, I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart

Well, I watched her tip the porter
As she stepped aboard that midnight train bound to take her faraway forever
I watched the tail light fade away knowing she was goin' to stray
And I wish this broken heart was leavin' with her

Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
