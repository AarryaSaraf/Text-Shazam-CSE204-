Album: GodHatesUsAll

// Darkness Of Christ //

Mankind in his insatiable search for divine
Knowledge has discarded all biblical teachings

Realizing that the strength of religion is the repression of
knowledge
All structures of religion have collapsed

Life prays for death
in the wake of the horror of these revelations

It was never imagined how graphic the reality that would
be known as the end
of creation
Would manifest itself

We believe all this chaos and atrocity can be traced
Back to one single event

We hold these truths to be painfully self-evident
All men are not created equal
Only the strong will prosper
Only the strong will conquer
Only in the darkness of Christ have I realized
God Hates Us All

// Disciple //

Drones since the dawn of time
Compelled to live your sheltered lives
Not once has anyone ever seen
Such a rise of pure hypocracy
I'll instigate I'll free your mind
I'll show you what I've known all this time

God Hates Us All, God Hates Us All
You know it's true God hates this place
You know it's true he hates this race

Homicide-Suicide
Hate heals, you should try it sometime
Strive for Peace with acts of war
The beauty of death we all adore
I have no faith distracting me
I know why your prayers will never be answered

God Hates Us All; God Hates Us All
He Fuckin' hates me

Pessimist, Terrorist targeting the next mark
Global chaos feeding on hysteria
Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies

I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow

Man made virus infecting the world
Self-destruct human time bomb
What if there is no God would you think the fuckin' same
Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say
I got my own philosophy

I hate everyone equally
You can't tear that out of me
No segregation -separation
Just me in my world of enemies

I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
I'll never be the one to blindly follow
I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple

I reject this fuckin' race
I despise this fuckin' place

// God Send Death //

On your back look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death more than insane
Profane pleading cries
Watch you die inside watch you die

God send death end misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin a shattered faith
Down on your knees
Your screaming out to die

Death is over due
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs' lust watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures flesh from bone
Down on your knees
Your screaming out
To die

Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Clawing at the eyes of god
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain
Your scream-in your grave
Clawing at the eyes of god
You pierce your throat and hands
You've gone insane with pain
Your blind screaming for your god
Pathetic god

Death's design blood splattered wall
Face melting one vicious whore
Twisted figures
Drown your mind in pain

// New Faith //

Holy man open up your eyes
To the ways of the world you've been so blind
As the walls of religion come crashing down
How's the ignorance taste the second time around

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
Join the new faith for the celebration
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation

Holy man come and worship me
I am all that you ever wanted to be
I'm the life of indulgence you never knew
The epitome of evil shining through

Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end
Tell me what it's like when the celebration begins

Welcome to the horror of the revelation
Tell me what you think of your savior now
I reject all the biblical views of the truth
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times
I won't be force fed prophecies
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind
I keep the bible in a pool of blood
So that none of its lies can affect me

This is new faith
A different way of life
Witness the shame
See for yourself the lies
I'll take the fight
Bring it every time, any time
Refuse to let them win
My heresy begins

Pray for life - wish for death
Pray for life - know in time you'll pray for death

Tear it away
It lives inside your mind
Silence the fear
That keeps you pure inside
Now you can see
Life's atrocities endlessly
Witness the miracle
Witness the miracle

Pray for life - wish for death
Pray for life - with every breath
You'll pray for death - you'll pray for death
Embrace new faith, embrace new faith
Yeah, new faith - yeah, new faith.

// Cast Down //

Despair, emptiness
See the hatred wasted on yourself
Face down taste the dust; it's getting harder everyday
Just to find a reason not to end it all yourself
Suicide on the street
Everywhere around you watch it breed
It begins to bury you in self-induced rejection

So now you're wasted, broken down
I see through your ignorance
Penetrate the surface of your insecure inside
Next fix, shoot it up
Looking for the place where god speaks
Every time you find him he just stabs you in the back
again

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing

Just a statistic in the shadows of the real world
The system's failing you just the way it failed me
Hell is home on the concrete where the city bleeds
America - home of the free - land of fucking
disenchantment

Despair, emptiness
Isolation rapes you everyday
Face down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave
Haven't found a reason
Haven't found a thing to fucking live for
Godless he doesn't care
How you choose to destroy yourself
In a world that feeds on hate
You're left here just to waste away
In your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland

No one hears you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you
No one sees you
You're society's infection
I won't judge you
When the blood steals life from you

Cast down and thrown away
You are the living dead
The needle numbs the pain
Of all your suffering
This is where the world of money changes nothing

// Threshold //

I don't want to see, I don't want to hear
I don't want to feel anything, can't you understand?
Everything I do doesn't stem from you
It doesn't have a fucking thing to do with you
I just want to die, throw it all away
Never have to feel again the way you make me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that spews from me
Take it

I can't control the rage that flows from me
I can't shut it down; it overwhelms me
I can't stop the rage that flows from me

Can't stop the
Violence, I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious, I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate, there is no other way
It's my discipline, it's my way of life

Never wanted bliss, never wanted you
Never needed anyone, I've polluted
Everything you feel, everything you are
Everything you'll ever be; you repulse me
It's always about you, you always come at me
With shit I can't identify, you know it makes me
Lose my fuckin' mind all the fuckin' time
Can't control the violence that's spewing from me
Take it

Can't stop the
Violence, I love it
No one's immune to hate that flows from it
Infectious, I feed on it
Every fucking endless day
You're either on my side or else you're in my way
No one stands a chance when I'm lashing out
Random hate, there is no other way
It's my discipline, it's my way of life
Yeah!

I can't stop the rage
I can't stop to hate you
I can't control the violence

// Exile //

I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious, you've got no one to run to

Exile
Exile
Exile
Exile

Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless â fuck this
You make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it â can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you, every time I think of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
'Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance, I just want you to die

There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway

Exile
Exile
Exile
Exile

Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin' fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you
Or anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose?
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot â you're just wasting my time
Get out of my face â get out of my life
Out of my fucking way â just die

// Seven Faces //

I saw them all around today
They don't stop they won't go away
They love the darkness in my eyes
Help me find a way out when I'm lost within myself

They show me everything I need
There's nothing wrong with a little greed
Never enough to satisfy
Such a driving desire that burns inside

My life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me

They all look like me
I never see them coming
But they show me more of myself
Drawn into the depths
I never knew existed
Launching me face first
Into the pleasures of pure lust and greed
I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
everything

My Life came with it's own scars
I don't need you to tell me about your sorrow
I can't say I've seen it all
But I live for the things that keep me hollow

Everyday I look into the mirror
Staring back I look less familiar
I've seen all seven faces
Each one looks a lot like me

They all look like me

I am becoming all things envied, I am the excess
I want it all more pain more sex more lies more of
everything

// Bloodline //

Eternal the kiss I breath
Siphon your blood to me
Feel my wounds of your god
Forever rape mortality
I smell of death
I reek of hate
I will live forever
Lost child pay the dead
Bleeding screams of silence
In my veins your eternity

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

First breath born come alive learn to kill
Bloodfest awaits to feed your hunger
Dark side has no rival test your faith in blood
Night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

I am the first not the last
Condemned by a single kiss
Betrayed eternally I'll rip inside your soul
Contaminating the world
Defying god and son
Black heart that brings your death
Living in infamy

Drink the flesh of life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years

I'll kill you and your dreams tonight
Begin new life
Bleed your death upon me
Let your bloodline feed my youth

Blame god chosen children
As you die I'm immortal
Faithless no religion
Stalking prey is my confession
Captive blood enslavement
Pain and hunger drives your madness
Drink flesh life itself
Prepare to reign a thousand years

// Deviance //

I embrace the darkness within
Forever serve beneath its hand
Horrid thoughts that surface to me
Ceremony bloods command
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
Death is here deep inside your

Skinned alive now naked
Terrorized no humanity
Seek salvation from an mia god
Empty vessels chanting for your death

Walk the streets beneath the shadows
Searching for a cryptic bride
Eat alive the conscience I hate
Without pain I watch you die
I will live through this forever
I have done the things you grieve
As you kneel before its evil
My face is the last you'll see

Soaked in blood the mask you wear
Haunting cries the dead scream for me
Staring eyes invoke no guilt
I can taste your mind your lifeless

Face the dead and dying
Feel your life drain
Through your soul
Seek salvation from an mia god
Empty vessels chanting for the dead

Death is yours
Your veins have dried
Staring eyes of glass now empty
Still you speak with lips so cold
In my head I hear you cry

God is dead can't save me
Taking lives with impunity
Resurrection of a deviant Christ
Feeding hate to capacity - deviance
