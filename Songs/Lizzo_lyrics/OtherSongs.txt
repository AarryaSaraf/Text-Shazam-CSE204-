// Fitness //

Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

I've been lifting heavy metal
See this ass? Ain't no rental
Take it down low like just stretching
Pick it back up like I'm flexing
Woo, tryna get it, working on my fitness

Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off

Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

Toot toot, beep beep
Toot toot, beep beep
I been working, working on my fitness

Ooh, work my body like
Ooh, I know you want it like
Ooh, but I don't do this for you

Think about how I'm gonna feel when I step up on the catwalk
Think about how I'm gonna feel when I got that ass that don't stop
That ass that don't stop, that ass don't stop
And think about how I'm gonna feel when I take it all off
But I don't do this for you

Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business (Better mind yo business)
I been working, working on my fitness (I'm working on my fitness)
Independent, athletic
I been sweating, doing calisthenics
Booty vicious, mind yo business
I been working, working on my fitness

// Good As Hell (Remix) //

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on and dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going to the pool shit

Come now come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice lemme simplify
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
(Feelin' good as hell)
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Woo, girl need to kick off your shoes
Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you

(Thank God) 'Cause he better know my worth
There's so much that I deserve
But I ain't worried now, I'm 'a let my hair down
He been trying but not today
So girl, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

Listen

So girl, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
(Feelin' good as hell)
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feeling' good as hell)

Ha-ha, I danced, that's what I did

// La Bañerita //

La Bañerita.

Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to take a shower. But when he went inside the bathroom the shower was missing! "Where did it go?" he wondered. Being a reasonable man, he did the only thing a reasonable man would do. He gently stepped into the corner where the shower once had been, stood up straight, opened his mouth, and out came pure and clean crystal-clear water. As the water warmed up, the shy little shower popped its head through the bathroom door, looked around, and gently stepped inside the bathroom, stood under the water, and got clean.

The End.

// Never Felt Like Christmas //

Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

Never cared for jingle bells or picking out a tree
I would rather paint my nails and watch some bad TV
But ever since we shared a kiss, I've been spreading the news
It never felt like Christmas

Sugar plums and candy canes, they did nothing for me
You could find me home alone and ordering Chinese
But now I save that old fruit cake 'cause there's enough for two
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with
You, you, oh, you, you, you, you, you, you

The nutcracker was boring and the carolers off-key
I never saw a miracle on 50-something Street
But now I'm singing, bells are ringing, everything is new
I'm fa-la-la-la-la-ling into love with you, ooh ooh oh, you
All these years, I've been let down until you came around
It never felt like Christmas

January, February, April, March and May
Come and go when I'm alone, December felt the same
But when I see that red and green, now I don't feel so blue
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you
('Til I spent it with you, 'til I spent it with you)
'Til I spent it with you, baby ('Til I spent it with you)
It never felt like Christmas 'til I spent it with you

// Nothing Breaks Like A Heart //

Hallelujah

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart

I heard you on a phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking (Yeah, it's smoking)
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken (We're broken)

Mmm, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Oh, nothing breaks like my heart

We'll leave each other cold as ice and high and dry
The desert wind is blowin' (Yeah, it's blowin')
Oh, remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Oh, and nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now
And nothing, nothing, nothing

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar, oh (Crash in the dark)
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like my heart

And nothing, nothing, nothing
(And nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now)
Unbreak my heart, yeah
(And nothing, nothing, nothing's gonna save us now)
Save us now

// Rapture //

Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotised
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movements and a wild attack
Face to face, sadly solitude
And it's finger pop
It's 24-hour shopping in Rapture

Fab Five Freddie told me everybody fly
DJ's spinning I said my oh my
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
Francois sais pas, Flashe no deux
And you don't stop, sure shot
You go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and you drive real far
And you drive all night, then you see a light
And it comes right down and lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run, but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
Then you're in the man from Mars
And you go out at night, eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns, too, Mercuries and Subarus
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars
You go out at night and you eat up bars
Where the people meet face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man, dance toe to toe
Don't move too slow, 'cause the man from Mars
Is through with cars, he's eatin' bars
Yeah, wall to wall, door to door
Hall to hall, he's gonna eat 'em all
Rapture, be pure
Take a tour, through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, just paint a train
And you'll be singin' in the rain
I said, don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Don't stop, do the punk rock
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
When the, uh, when the TV's on
And now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and eatin' bars
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get up
And he only eats guitars, get up

// Someday At Christmas //

Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where we are free, ooh, yeah
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where we are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Woah, someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When we all equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where we are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime

Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart

(Someday all our dreams will come to be)
(Someday in a world where men are free)
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime

// Special (Remix) //

(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
Special

Woke up this morning to somebody judging me
No surprise they judging me
Don't know who I'm 'posed to be
I'm just acting up, I'm pressed as fuck and never saying sorry
Found it in the end, I can only do it for me
You call sensitive and I call it superpower
You just like empathy 'cause you think it gives you power
All I know is only God can judge me
I don't hide my heart, I wear it on me

I'm used to feelin' alone, oh (Alone)
So I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (Nobody, no, no)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (So glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect

Special (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
(Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you could cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change?
How could you throw fuckin' stones if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so much shame, hm

I'm used to feeling alone, so
I thought that I'd let you know, oh

In case nobody told you today (I wait around for you)
You're special
In case nobody made you believe (Nobody made you believe)
You're special
Well, I will always love you the same (I'll always love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (Perfect)

I'm used to feelin' alone, oh (No, you're not alone)
So I thought that I'd let you know
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

In case nobody told you today (Nobody told you, nobody)
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special (Oh, yeah)
Well, I will always love you the same (I'll always love you, I'll always love you)
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)
Broken, but damn, you're still perfect (I'm so glad, so glad, so glad)

Special
You are, you are, you are, so
Special
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Stayin' alive (Oh yeah, woo)

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I been kicked around since I was born

And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
It was stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Ow, what you want

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm dancin' and I just can't lose

And now it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive)
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
It was stayin' alive, stayin' alive (Stayin' alive)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh)
Stayin' alive (Woo, hoo hoo)
Ow, what you want

I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
Somebody, help me, yeah (I'm stayin' alive, I'm stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere (Nowhere)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Nowhere)
I'm stayin' alive (Stayin' alive)

Somebody, help me, yeah (Life goin' nowhere)
Life goin' nowhere (Come on, y'all)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Yeah)

Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)

Look like a girl, act (like a lady)
Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)

I need to remind you that you talkin' to The Chalice
I am woman, hear me rawr, Queen of the Wonderland, not Alice
And if you wanna get with' it, house so little, you not rented
Take out that mortgage and spend it and you'll get zero percentage
(If I said it), I did it, if I did it, I meant it
Actions bring the pain like Dennis the Menace
Slingshot, David and Goliath on them boys
'Cept when this tree falls, yes, it will make a noise
(Timber! Boom!)
Testosterone in the room, I break it up with estrogen
I ain't tryna get chose, I'm already chosen

Look like a girl, act (like a lady)
Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)

Look like a girl, act (like a lady)
Think like a man but work like a boss
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
(Work like a boss, work-work like a boss)
