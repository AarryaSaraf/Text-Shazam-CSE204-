// Cuz I Love You //

I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Never been in love before
What the fuck are fuckin' feelings yo?
Once upon a time I was a hoe
I don't even wanna hoe no more
Got you somethin' from the liquor store
Little bit of Lizzo and some Mo
Tryin' to open up a little more
Sorry if my heart a little slow

I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love impaired
But baby, baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
Yes you
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)

Got me standin' in the rain
Gotta get my hair pressed again
I would do it for you all my friend
Ready baby? Will you be my man?
Wanna put you on a plane
Fly you out to wherever I am
Kept you on the low, I was ashamed
Now I'm crazy 'bout to tat your name

I thought that I didn't care
I thought I was love impaired
But baby, oh baby
I don't know what I'm gon' do
I'm cryin', 'cause I love you
Yeah, I'm cryin', hey!

// Soulmate //

True story
No glory, let's go

Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type
They used to say, "To get a man, you gotta know how to look"
They used to say, "To keep a man, you had to know how to cook"
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju with Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude

'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"
(One, one, one) The one
(One, one, one like) Damn, she the one
(One, one, one) The one
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
(Love, love, love) Like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
Look up in the mirror like, "Yeah, she the one"

And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'ma marry me one day

True love ain't somethin' you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf

'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down (Always gonna hold me down)
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely (No, I'm never lonely, no)
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"
(One, one, one) The one
(One, one, one like) Damn, she the one
(One, one, one) The one
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
(Love, love, love) Like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
Look up in the mirror like, "Damn, she the one"

(I'm the one)
(I'm the one) You're the one
(I'm the one)
(The one) Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"

(One, one, one)
(One, one, one) Like damn, she the one
(One, one, one)
Bad bitch in the mirror like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
(Love, love, love) Like, "Yeah, I'm in love"
(Love, love, love) In love
Look up in the mirror like

'Cause I'm my own soulmate
I know how to love me
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down (Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one")
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate
No, I'm never lonely
I know I'm a queen, but I don't need no crown

Look up in a mirror like, "Damn, she the one"

// Jerome //

Wooh!
Ah, here we go again
Uh-uh
Hee hee
Uh, look, listen, shut up

Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry
2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part

Jerome, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person
To carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick (But I can call 'em for you if you want)
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, oh! Don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this

Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown, oh
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns

(Hee, hee, hee, hee) Don't cry for me, baby
(Hee, hee, hee, hee) Don't cry
(Hee, hee, hee, hee) Don't cry for me, baby
(Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee) Yeah, yeah

// Crybaby //

Pull this car over, babe
Don't pretend like you don't know
A lot of girls have time for this shit
Honestly, I don't

He said, "Why you cryin', baby?
Why you cryin', baby?
What did I do wrong?"
I said, "Shut up and kiss me, oh
'Cause I don't wanna be here for long."

I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
This big girl's gotta cry

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You should feel honored, boy
Uh, you got me feelin' this much
I clear my schedule for you
Let my guard down for you
And you gon' make me put it back up

Oh, you know why I'm cryin'
Why I'm cryin', baby
You don't pick up the phone
You do the same thing
To your friends and family
You gon' end up alone

I swore you'd never see this side
But it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't need to apologize
This big girl's gotta cry

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

It feels so fine, so good sometimes
A big girl's gotta cry
(After this is done, just take me home)
(I'm feelin' vulnerable)
I don't need to apologize
This big girl's gotta cry

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, it's my life
You know it hurts sometimes
My love is your yours
Why can't your love be mine?

Ooh
Ooh
Oh, I get a little lost sometimes
Sometimes you need to cry

// Exactly How I Feel //

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

I woke up this morning
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it
Oh
I might be a bitch
I might make a friend
Ain't I so amazing?

Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

Don't hide no emotions
Wear 'em on my sleeve
All my feeling's Gucci
Can't hold back my tears
That would be a crime
'Cause I look pretty cryin'
Oh, they ain't tell you?

Love me or hate me
Ooh, I ain't changing
And I don't give a fuck, no

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

I feel like hurtin' they feelings
I don't get mad, I get millions
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling

I ain't with that actin' all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
They fire close by like it's Whitney

Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust a whole clip till it's empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, God willing

Fire chains on like brr
Feelin' like rockin' my fur
Rolls Royce with the chauffer
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci

Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream
I could scream
I could scream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel

// Truth Hurts //

Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo

I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm a hundred percent that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "shoot your shot" when you see 'em
It's OK, he already in my DM

Why're men great 'til they gotta be great?
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
New man on the Minnesota Vikings
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

I'ma hit you back in a minute
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it
(One time) We don't fuck with lies (Two times), we don't do goodbyes
We just keep it pushing like aye yi yi
I'ma hit you back in a minute
I don't play tag, bitch, I been it
