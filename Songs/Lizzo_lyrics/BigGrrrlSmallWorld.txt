// Ain't I //

Uh, uh, uh, I'm in the, I'm in the, I'm in the
I'm in the business of making music, that music business
The fitness, no one can witness cause I
I make that crack music (nigga!), uh
That real Black music (nigga!)
The only singles that I'm dropping are the ones
Flapping at the band of your white briefs
White boys please! Can barely believe
I walk by as they hold they skeets by the seams of they jeans
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, and run it to the hills y'all
Straight into my pocket, tired of the deals dog
Start my own label, keep the leaking sealed off
If you got a big mouth, then you might get peeled off
I'm the only fat-lipped bass, my flipper-vroom! -peel off
Eating flounder, Sebastian's like some bath salts
Munching on his bones, looking at him like "It's yo' fault!"
"Look at what you made me do! Yo, pass the hot sauce"

Looking at the back of Sophia Eris's head
Eating a sammich (but we don't got bread!)
Got a spider ass bite on my head, hangry
Feeling soupy, I brought my fuck in, yo I'm duckin'
Donald, Daffy, Howards, them cowards
Could never throw shots at a super with power
What was Russia without the czars?
What was Henry Ford without the cars?
My grandparents worked at Ford factory
So Henry is nothing without my family tree
And his slave-owning family needed Black blood still
So I think we need a spot up on Henry's will
That would never be the case, in case you ain't keeping up
I'm dishing out cases of that heavy bass
And them bassheads straight from the oppressor's loins
Are giving us our "Free us!" in hella coin

So bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories-
(Big GRRRL, Small World!)

It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light
It don't matter how deep yo' pockets go
They still get they fill, fingers scrape the bottom
It don't matter how deep yo' soul is
They sho' is blinded by the light!
(Crazy!)

Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, hip-hop turned crack from the era of crack babies
Bob your head crazy, bob your head crazy
Hip-hop, about to give oratories in stadiums and laboratories

And ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman? Ain't I a woman?!

// Betcha //

My niggahick-a, momma hiccup
Got to pick up the holiday
And check plus the tip cause
Bounces right off they dinner
You lookin like, I say what
I am the breadwinner
You a crip bruh
Just the tip, cause
Got to go how you say
Bouts the dim sum
Heavy setter, jet-setter

Oh you too hoe tell me
You ain't riding the best whips son
Bouncing all in your courtroom
Objectify and undress you
Till you ask one in the darkroom
Exposure bitch, don't get sued
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me
Even

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup
Looking like Stevie

Yup
Bout to post my list on the wall
Of the school auditroium
Tacked up neatly
Sheets upon, sheets upon sheets
Weeks upon, weeks upon weeks
That these people cold feet

I've got a tissue for you boo-hoos
Hip-hop guys round singing the blues
I ain't talking bout the rapper
I'm talking bout the gift beneath the wrappers
Called a happily ever after
Fact is, it ain't too late
You still been making them hits
Since the seventh grade
Big business, say forever
That's a mighty long time
A wise woman once told me

And you can't see me
Even if you have binoculars
You can't see me
Even if you have glasses
You can't read me
All these bitches in the coup

Uh, Ima pop a cherry today
Alright, Ima pop a cherry today

You can't murder
Runnin out the game (get it)
Gettin locked up or
Gettin locked up
You know I used to get rich

// Ride //

LA carolin' with Carolyn
Caroline but I had to make it rhyme, I'm
Addicted to that weather like heroin
That is why I cannot give it any time, just say no!
It's too good to me, you are too good to me
O.D. on compliments, I need some oxygen
So I dip to the PNW, some of ya don't need where that is - good!
Need a little solitude with my crew
'Membering what's real is what makes you you, oh!
It's too good to me, know it's no good for me
I can't be out here homie, what it used to be
Sitting in bed like "man! ", wishing
Itching for days with no end
Sound checks, checks in, audiences rapping
Getting full of that adrenaline, eat it up like Satan
You can't have it? Take it, you can't man up? K then
Breaking up my cadence, got that willpower like Jaden, blaow!

And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

Flying into Paris with Sophia Eris
Had a heart-to-heart over fresh croissant
Wondering why these dudes be tripping
She like "Girl I'm past giving a damn!"
YOLO, guess that's why he want a photo
Dressed in Polo, arm around me after the show
But never there when I need hoes
Open mind but my heart closed, ah!
Where ya been? Back again, young man?
I remember you from way way when
You never gave it or reciprocated
But when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake
"She left me" is always the excuse
I swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo
Meet once a week and deal with y'all issues
Google me and jack off in a tissue

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

I will never be the person that you want me to
Feeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do
But I'm here now, like how this happen?
Head in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n
I'm chilling, I swear I been chilling
Taking a break, feeling hella breakable
I was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no
Bet I made some, granted
But my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite
Wrote this song halfway to Chicago
Wondering if I should call you
What, to make you feel special?
Would it give me reasons to forget you?
(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message...)
I'm out of state, out of time
You more like out of sight, out of mind

Yeah! You know what though?
We keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up
And we keep it going up
Make it go around, around, again
And we keep it going up
Going up

// Humanize //

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

My hands are cold
My lips are tired, tryin' to blow (blow!)
To give them warmth
It's not enough, one heart alone
Cannot suffice
It simply can't, I've done the math
But in due time
There is no chance, for love

I try to try (see the love through)
I try, to try

Your skin is warm
It keeps me up though I am tired
I'm tryin' to know
What else? Why else has this happened?
One man alone
Cannot suffice, I've done the research
Ignore the role
Inside my bed, your lion features (no!)
You can't lay on my shoulder
There are spikes and scales
And your cheek would just depress me
(In) a heavy haze, we love it
Love the taste of it, (you clench your jaw)
We love it, (you love it!)

Humanize me, baby
Humanize me, baby
I try!

I try to try, I, I (see the love through)
I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
Who's gonna open the door?

(By your side standing)
(I will be there by your side standing)

I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby, ooh!)
I try, I try to try, and see the love through human eyes
(Humanize me, baby)

You smell so good
You're broke
Broken

// Bother Me //

Have you ever been to Paris at night?
Say something French
[?]

Right out the gate, I'm flowin' individually
You owe me your check
Respecting a pony, I swear to God like a helmet
Free as I move booze
I'm paid to amuse you's
Amazed at how soon we could get this far
Broke off of mix tapes
Still broke off that mix tape
But I promise y'all that it won't last as long
'Cause me and my girls, delinquents
We renting jewels and the trinkets
Trumps bumping something fan fare when we arrive like

Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor

I feel like any minute decision
With precision, I pick off
Make my selection on who I choose to crew with
Girl, don't touch us
I know you want us to slip but
Slippin' is something we don't do
Tippin' for life, grippin' that ice
You thirsty to wife, uh
We playing y'all home like bassoons
We going straight up like balloons
We fresh outta that saloon
We steady making y'all goals droop
With that vidal, with that sasoon
You been lost, where you been at?

Hard rap, card trap, made for the mall rat
Blast this, in ear, make them witness
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
Don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
Drops it, drops it on the floor
(Oh my gosh)
(Don't bother me
Don't bother me)

I beg you, don't bother me when I'm on the road
You on mama's back
He drops it on the floor
My side dude complains and keeps it on the low
He touch himself to magazines
To pictures of his own

D-d-don't bother me, bother me
D-d-don't bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me
Bother me, bother me

Ego
Been showing lovers their own selves
Covered in [?]
Pride
Without natural affection
Truth ablaze
Where you been at?
Where you been at?
Bother me, bother me, bother me

I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
It got me thinkin' about thinking of you
I been drinkin' on the vodka orange juice
And you know I, know I, know I loved you
Think 'bout you
But I don't got time for livin' side the comforts
Of my God damn time so I leave it up to me
You been sendin' all these broken signals
I just keep him asking what we could have done
You tell me that I am too ambitious
But I break the moulds and you just watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
Watch the stones roll
You watch my stone roll away from you
It didn't even take three days
Didn't even take me there
Didn't even take me there

// B.G.S.W. //

(Here we are)
(And all my big girls tell 'em)
(Here we are)
(Bigger than the sun and the moon)

We can take over the earth
We can take over the earth

Too bad you couldn't be on the roster
Ya man, ya dig, ya can't speak rasta
Betty SpaghettiOs, no pasta
Just hog the coin like Whore-hey Washington

Poster child for big black ambition
Coattail-flunking and Timmy's wishlist
Tim chance be the only thing on my wishlist
Fried chicken and a bottle of Seagram's

Right?

Stereotypical archetypes
Arching and bishing, get radio play, like
I'm a fit right in today
Let me get a seat at the front of the Grammys
Let me get a little bit of bitter grapes
I can't want what I want anyway
So I just kick back like Kid 'n' Play
Staying on the come-up like, 'that's my play'

Cinderella, 2am, ain't got nothin' on the way I keep the movin'
Shoot the hits and out the lat to rap the lap [?]
Rappers all about the double enten-dres
Andre the Giant, on Dre the three stacks
Poppin chick peas like some andre manila
Manila your rice up and (red?)

Bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
(Listen!)

Come on, come on, welcome to Earth
We like to kill each other, turn each other to dirt
Got a lotta money? You the man now, babe
Better break me off some, Imma show you crazy
Show y'all crazy anyway
Any way you wanna slice that key lime tasty
Got my batches and cookies, gettin' nasty on sookie
Me and Sophia did it all for the nookie

Fame, love and money
It's powerful thangs if you think it is
But the thang is, it's thankless to be the baddest chick who ain't naked
That's cool, what's cool, I ain't postin' flick
You a magician you like turnin' tricks
Got a trick for you, or maybe a treat
Now get your freak on a leash and lick my feet
I am on another level
Elevator, escalator, brahman
Pocahontas in her corset shading the Queen of England I am

Fools be like "The precipice is the end"
But I think it's the beginnin' (what)
Close your eyes and take the leap
Watch 'em wave as you fly to the top no drop
(Fly)

(Her- here- here- here we are)
(Yo can take- take- watch us take over)

It's bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it
Bigger than the sun and the moon
I can feel it in my bones, we can take over the world
And all my big girls tell it
Let the big girls tell it

// The Fade //

Full of fried food and fatigue, uh
Full of fried food and fatigue
I-I-I ain't gettin' no sleep so I guess when I'mma wake
Mama-se, mama-sa, I'mma dream
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
Hol' up, hol' up, wait, no, hol' up
Gotta pack with my girls, no feelings all green
But you know no "I" in the team
By golly, Miss Molly, we in this thang
Big Bag Wolf, he make them piggies scream
All three houses-straw, sticks, bricks
And we blew 'em all down, dang, blousers
I don't play games but I know enough about 'em, how to win 'em bruh
Realize that it's not a game and jealousy is unhealthy, competition yo
Welcome to the field, nigga, home of the field nigga
Hard-working mother ugly duckling, black swan
Try to keep it in the real some time
But I gotta deal with a whole lotta nothing
And my whole life in front it so I guess I gotta run it
Seeing futures when I close my eyes
But I gotta deal with a whole lotta nothing
And my whole life in front it so I guess I gotta run it

I felt the fade but the fade's never over
You playing games but you don't got a scoreboard
I can't relate, I ain't made for this sport boy
It's for the worst

How can I make you feel? How can I
How can I make you feel when I don't even feel myself?
Not saying I'm not cocky but I know when it come to the flow
I will outdo myself, boom boom bang
They ain't the best cause they ain't in they lane
How can you try to be something you're not?
That is not art, girl please explain
Cut out the middle man, be instrumental
I'm not the one to play the second fiddle
Bach off my show kid, I'm tryna make Mozart
(I ain't seen the back of my eyelids in like a week)
Guess I gotta run it

I felt the fade but the fade's never over
You playing games but you don't got a scoreboard
I can't relate, I ain't made for this sport boy
It's for the worst

I felt the fade but the fade's never over
You playing games but you don't got a scoreboard
I can't relate, I ain't made for this sport boy
It's for the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Ah-ah-ah-ah!
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade
I felt the fade

// 1 Deep //

I stopped talking to my mama for three months
No eye contact during lunch
Wasn't nothing else around us but mountains and trees
And my guilty worthless screams, "What was wrong with me?"
Was the question, it was, it was "How could she?"
What happen to a daddy girl when daddy don't exist no more?
I guess we gon' see

Wishing I could call you
You know when that bell ring
Angels get they wings
Someone tell me we gon'
Be alright but I think
That I gotta be
One deep
One deep, one deep

Dip my black body in gold (uniform)
I just wanna shed (ice cold)
Diamond crust (getting warm)

Somebody put me on the soap box
I got the voice of my kin folk, my mama
Mama gave me blessings and then some
I'm youngest of two, feeling like a elder
Alone in my room, wishing I could tell ya
"I love you", "I love too"
The best of me only comes out when it's you
But sorry ain't in my vocabulary

Man you better call me
You know when that bell ring
I will be on time
Someone told me if we
Listen to our hearts then
We gon' be alright (I'm ready)
Four deep
Four deep

When I melted into your chest
Just read this and think about it
Talk to me in person

// The Realest //

(Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear-appear-appear
(Gotta step yo game up)

What y'all want me to say, young man?
I am one woman
And my time is how you say expensive
I see they waste time on them expletives
I'm all verbs baby, let's go, you cute
I'm feeling sadistic, you will do
Another one if you got the juice
To pass around, it's for my crew
Yeah, he loving the crew
He wanna get booed, just do what it do
The turnover's too predictable
Can I tell the truth?
You might not make it so come get it babe

Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

What you know, what you know
What you know about falling in love with yourself?
Every day looking in the mirror
Think I found the proof for my health or my wealth
Yeah, laid up in this hotel
Sparkling bubbles and a pear
55 minutes till my sound check
Singing ain't the worse way they on a planet, jet
I'm taking all of my time, all of it
Body working hard, shower head
Sprinkling the stress away, tell em Lizzo wanna wait
But I'mma be looking real good when I get there, whoo!
Got a lot of problems, my niche ain't one
I slid right in, no swish, And1
I could have em if I want em, these boys is fun
Got em picking off the petals, baby one by one

Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

(Make it harder)
(It could all, it could all be so simple)
Like you want me to go
[?] like you want me to go
Like you want me to stay, like you want me to go
[?]

Looking like no other ho in here
Feeling like the realest
Can I peep the way he disappear?
Gotta step yo game up

// En Love //

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Kissing on my mirror
Staring in my eyes
Appreciating every curve and crevice
Smack my thighs
Smack it twice, watch it jiggle
You a bad batch cookie, cream filling in the middle
I'm a very picky girl
And yes you can call me mama
I got an A in self-esteem
So save the drama for Obama
Presidential in my stature
Statuesque and big as hell
If you in love with what you do, then leave them thirsties by the well
If they talking bout you, let 'em
You they entertainment
Reading you yo rights, just make it rain what they arraignin'
It's raining, it's pouring
Men in they're boring
Hallelujah thanking Jesus he made men so they could please us
All these years been searching for something that would complete me
Who knew that it would be me

I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love

Okay, this verse is about my best friend, bad as she can be
The only one that's on her level happens to be me
She'll give you a sprinkle, to them flounders by them [?]
But ween 'em, as quick as she get that peen
And ditch like a queen can
[?], after dinner I like that dessert
But he thirsty like he in the desert
What's worse, give it to him or get my own
Think I'm bout to hit him with that scissor
Cut, print, this scene is done
Nice to know, you all so nice to know
Level son, you on level one
I'm like ding, ding, ding, elevation
All my beautiful, big black beauty girls
Brown paper bag, [?] coke can, [?]
Light skin, curly hair
Afro, in the air
Love yourself like nobody else can

Like my hands in the air
Fingers kiss the sky
Smile on my lips, and I don't know why
I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
I think I'm in love
With myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself, I'm in love

Oh my God
Bionik, Bionik
Iconic, Iconic

// My Skin //

Learning to love yourself and like learning to love your body is like a whole journey that I feel like every person, but more specifically, women, have to go through so I feel like doing this is a good way to kinda break through and kinda seal the last chapter of the "learning to love" and just loving...

Ooh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best
Kept secret? Beneath the surface, we could
Let it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh
I'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions
Though it's hard to re-envision time and time again
Even when, even when it didn't matter anymore
The most beautiful thing that you ever seen
Is even bigger than what we think it means
Reflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than

I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin

Real world, big girl meets world
A crazy position, now your dreams is your mission, huh?
Staring in the mirror, realizing, wish it worked
Now all I wish is for a chance to give my kids a Ford
I got a family tree that's worth praising the Lord
Mama looking like the second, whoo! Look at God
Sister like a soldier, hold it down
Southwest gon' hold it down, uh
I love you, don't forget it, you beautiful Black masterpiece!
Boy, they don't make brothers like you
Uh, make it happen with that Black girl magic
The hat trick off of what we must do

I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin

Pardon me, just left a message to the city
Words stuck between my teeth, so gritty
Pay him for each minute I'm seething
A Black girl mixed with a little bit of Sacagawea
I pocket subpoenas, I swallow my pride and my ego
I wear my flaws on my sleeve and my skin like a peacoat
I see someone like me ashamed to be
And honestly, I'm really really
I'm fed up with' it, try to send it up like a FedEx
I'm wondering what they sayin' next
Can't pretend to not hear it
It's your beauty, they can't have it
It's yours, they can't have it

I'm done with the struggle. I wanna-I just wanna enjoy my life now and maybe appreciate my skin...

I woke up in this, I woke up in this
In my skin
I can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me
My brown skin
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
My skin, your skin, yeah!
Oh, I can't wash it away
No, you can't take it from me
Ooh, my skin, ooh, my skin, yeah!

This is something I was born with', you know? You can't buy this at a store, so hey...

// Jang A Lang //

Uh, yeah
Melanie, Melanie, you made a facsimile, uh
Big-booty Judy with too much to do this, uh
Back stabbing second cousins, the broodest
Self-righteous, like she crucified Judas
Go Melanie, go Melanie
For every day is "dress-like-she-fittin'-to-see-a-crush day"
Don't it get a liitle bit mundane?
Tell it like I see it, 'cause it's too fake, too fake, ok

"Oh my God, I just love your afro"
"If a guy doesn't wanna fuck me, what am I?"
Ok, I'm seein' my reflection and I'm breakin' it off
Melanie on Baywatch, the Hassel and Hoff
Enough pomp and circumstance to tassel us off
Worth more than the 10 days they pogo'd a [?]
That shit be the noycest, sometimes the noycest thinks Toightest
Like your personal chanel dog
Now you know you eatin' at Taco Bell, y'all
The spell's all been broke, say "Bye" to "Aw, hell naw"
"I mean, can I touch it?"
"Aw, hell naw"

Fac- fa- fac- fac- facsimile
Make a copy of the real thing
Leave the guy, come back for ten days
Jingo jango jang a lang a lang
Jingo jango jang a lang a lang
Jingo jango jang a lang a lang
Leave the guy, come back for ten days
Fac- fa- fac- fac- facsimile

Uh, lemme see it, lemme see it
Been knowin' it, lemme see it, uh
Hit the jango jang a lang a lang
Hit the jingo jango jang a lang a lang
The jingo jango jang a lang a lang
Uh, hit that jango lang
