Album: HellOn

// Hell-On //

God is not a contract or a guy
God is an unspecified tide
You cannot time its tables
It sets no glass or gables
God is a lusty tire fire
Its bristles scrape and strike the stage
A rock, paper, scissors' rage
Have mercy on the natural world

My voice is not the liquid waves
The perfect rings around a heron's legs
My voice is straight garroting wire
A stolen mile of fingerprints
Peeled the quiet from the dunes
Captured and re-spooled as ruin to be used
At a different time

My voice is a fracture
For shinbone's lust
Pounding barefoot ground
It lifts you up and sits you just
Just at sorrow's waterline
I drape you on tomorrow's plate
Fair as metal, marrow spilling
Not yours but mine
I'm an agent of the natural world

Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with
Don't you tell me I didn't warn you
That that's some gravity you ought not to play with

Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise
Nothing quite so poison as a promise

And me, I am not a mess
I am a wilderness, yes
The undiscovered continent for you to undress
But you'll not be my master
You're barely my guest
You don't have permission to take any pictures
Be careful of the natural world

Nature can't amend its ways
Boils along and then replays
Despite heartfelt springtimes of regret
The storms she still cries for days
Have mercy on the natural world

// Last Lion Of Albion //

Early in the morning where there used to be a stream
Is a tiny business lake
Don't let the cattails fool you
Down in the bottom where nothing is born
Sleeps a silver dollar with your face thereon

Wish I could trace the frowning compass of your mind
Drop the mercury down the Roman drain and summon mine

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Laid in the heavens that are already bought
Sleeps a red planet in a galaxy of your lion's thoughts
On the surface of your tender unintended machine
Is there a buckle knuckle kneel on a carpet of lion's tongues

Wish I could stand in the spray of the cliff of your sweet revenge
Ocean of naked serrated marble crushing in

Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
They'll steal your patents for the sun
And you'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
They'll use you for centuries to come
Your wounds the main road into London
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face on their money

Last lion of Albion
The last she-wolf to mother Rome
The last virgin to wash ashore
You'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
The last of the Mohicans gone
The last cedars of Lebanon
You'll feel extinction
Last lion of Albion
Last tiger of Tasmania
The last she-wolf to suckle Rome
You'll feel extinction
When you see your face
Face on their money

// Halls Of Sarah //

A childless widow of a nation
You cry like guns across the water
Yet we expect you to bring springtime, it isn't fair
Searchlights wither in your hair

You are a silent movie, Sarah

Men build their industries around you
Gathered in withers of your hair
They're looking farther on reflection
You're left to die of exposure, Sarah
Sarah with the beating heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
Sarah with the..
You are a silent movie, Sarah

Let her go, the light is fading
I cry like guns across the water
She didn't ask to be your remake or your muse
The parasites inside of booze

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is no one home

Sarah with the beaten heart
Sarah with the mouth of stone
I call but there is only echo

From a recording machine
Screaming [?] my dreams
You see our poets (poets)
Do an odious business
Loving womankind (womankind)
As lions love Christians
So who are you to deny
Who are you to deny them, Sarah?
(Sarah...)

(Echo, echo...)

(Round and round and round and round and round...)

// Bad Luck //

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Do you wish you could stop everything
And take back your love?
Are you sorry you gave it up so easy?
Do you cry like you're trying to be born?

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck
It's not as bad as I thought it would be
But it's still pretty bad luck

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

And love, the most contrary, I said, of them all
Dragging in on nature's coattails
Acting like it wrote the moon
Trying to pass riddles as poetry
Embargo is love's waiting room
And meantime, right here in human time
My heart could break for a one-legged seagull
And still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)

Are you tired of things going right?
Things going wrong?
Tired of trying to make everyone happy?
Too tired to sing your own songs

Woke a dog from a running dream
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Ate a black fly in the cream
And that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)
Chipped my tooth on an engagement ring
And that's bad luck (Bad luck)
Could have stopped any one of these things
But that would have been bad luck

So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
So I died and went to work
