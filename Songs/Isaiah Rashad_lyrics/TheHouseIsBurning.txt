Yeah, yeah, yeah

What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch

Yeah, whatever gon' keep your nose dry, my nigga, I'm with it
I know it got ya froze, my nigga, I feel it
Some niggas be runnin' away from life
Some niggas cut off the legs
If I was you, I'd be dead
Whatever gon' keep your mind blown, my nigga, maintain the wheel
My partner know I just came back, see, I done been dead for real
They mixin' up all of that no name, you know we be scared to chill
You know we be scared to feel, or anything else but, yeah

Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds

Is that you on the edge?
Whatever was under the bunk bed, I ain't scared, I'm ready
They locked the horns with matadors, okay, don't get too heavy
He shined his fangs and cuban chain, okay, don't get too heavy
They dug a grave, he came alive, okay, don't get too heavy

What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch
What am I supposed outside but get rich?
Work too hard, but boy, don't floss too hard
And get yo wig split
Pray to God
I heard they got new Gods outside in this bitch
Barely toddlers got them Purple Hearts
Outside in this bitch

Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds
Whatever gon' keep my kids safe, my kids full, I'm with it
I know what's at your nose, my nigga, for really
Some niggas gon' die in the cardboard
Some niggas gon' die in the feds

// From The Garden //

Came out bussin'
Came out puffin'
Came out fuckin', on yo cousin
I do all these floozies worser
Than they daddy but you love her
You in trouble
I'm lil sunny
I go BBQ with something
That's you busy
It ain't shit
I went shopping, left it running

Check my hunnids, check my onion
We watch cable, at my aunty's
'Cause my papa wasn't trappin'
But my uncle up to something
Mr. Magic, Billy Batson
Mr. Magic, Billy Batson
Miss me with that local hatin' on a nigga, get it crackin'

I'm not surprised, I'm on the rise
Been a lil ride, wet as my eyes
Spam it a lot, just hold it down
All I require, just hold it down
They gon' shit talk when we ain't around
Niggas be hating with feet on the ground
Got the lil jet with the beat on the couch
Nut on the Gucci and beat on her mouth

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin' (Hold on wait, hold on wait)
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin' (Hold on wait, hold on wait)
Came out bussin' (Wait)

Chanel on my feet, yeah, that's fur on my C's
I be fuckin' with the Bees, like Muhammad Ali
Dip her, upper cut this thing
Got yo bitch on the edge of her seat
She on the ecstasy, I'm on the bean
Swing her the ecstasy, edge of my v
(And usually), I like repetitive beat
I like the way that she moving my meat
Quality bitches, they look good to me
But I fuck the same girl 'cause I don't even cheat
That is a lie
Repetitive freak
I ain't even look, no, I ain't even seek
I ain't even peek
G5, G5
Competitive jeep
I'm tryna get all the muh fuggin' cheese
Bitch, I'ma boss, I'm wherever it be
I been on tour, I see more
I tell the motherfuckers feed me beats
Just like my music, yo bitch she elite

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin'

I'm gon' run it, I'm so cunning
High tech digit, flat for button
Passport shawty, airport prolly
Nascar audi, Swanton bomb it
Two white bitches, still gon' kick it
Fly shit, kicking
Steel toe pidgeon
Young like slizzy
Get back witcha
Step back, hit 'em with the step back swish it
Hatin' nigga hoping that it melt my glisten
Shit might triple, shit my missile
Shit might hit you, Fridigy Parker
And my Cody, that my nigga
I been stacking for a really
When he pull up, they gon' end it
He went platinum, up in prison
I'm just floating on a river

Please be early, please be gorgeous
Please be widdit, please be for it
Let me do donuts in your foreign
Let me play number 8 while I do it
Let me control it, I can control it
Eat it with one hand, maybe with nothin'
Play with my zipper, play with my bubba
That was yo sister, that was my summer

Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out bussin'
Came out bussin', came out bussin', came out...

// RIP Young //

Mane, you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine hunnid strong, I got P's, I got coke
Mane, you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine hunnid strong, I got P's, I got coke

We work to work
You late to work
I holla, then they send it
You know my plot was colder than Chicago in December
My bitch came up in Inglewood
Her mama was her daddy
And when I'm in the Midwest
She say holla at your family
My dog pass me that cup
Taste like candy, bitch
My dog out layin' down the law
Ain't breakin' no laws
Or serving out the rock
Southside still fuckin' in the car
Still flippin' in the car
Still shootin' out the car
Lil' hotbox smokin' our jar
Now I'm fuckin' on a star
Hold up, I got a call

Been sayin' that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tellin' bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot
Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doing donuts, yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog
Every time I hit the red lights, just shine
Ain't nothin' but a good day, don't die
They don't teach them how to pump fake, big shot

Ain't trippin', I don't wanna lose count
Talkin' my shit
It was just us, bitch
Fuck it, I'll drive
Hop in my ride
Pass me that dutch, bitch
On the westside
On the one-ten
Swingin' my nuts (Swingin' my nuts)
Fuck it, let's grill
Fuck it, let's spill
Spend a few crumbs
Pop smoke, pop shit, pop bitch
Young nigga, don't pop too much
Spaceships
Fake broke
Kanye, young nigga don't stay too long
Big truck, big wheel, big wop
Them niggas probably hate my guts
Tryna gain my trust
But it's all out of lust

Mane, you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine hunnid strong, I got P's, I got coke
Mane, you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope
For the nine hunnid strong, I got P's, I got coke

Been sayin' that I'm a cool cat, fuck that

Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doing donuts, yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog

My baby mama probably at the end of that bitch with her gold diggin' ass, nigga

[Amindi:]
Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though
Made a nigga perfect for his next hoe
Fuck it, I'ma get it off my chest though
Made a nigga perfect for his next hoe
Knew you would tryna bait me like a set
If I give ten percent, I'ma need it back tenfold

[Isaiah Rashad:]
Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya
Lay in the field, burn it down, we all herb

And if you dead, tell me somethin'
Like, what's ya life and how you livin'?
Did you slide it, did you build it?
Did you find it, did you grab it, did you ride it?
Like on the TV, tell me off on the marathon
Oh, you greedy, catch you, now don't embarrass some
You can't see me, John Cena in camouflage
And they see me, cashin' out on a Megatron
And the VV, lookin' just like it
Is Steve in the back? Is you broke? It's all perfect
Sleep on the cash, it was life, it's all real
Laid on the floor, I was broke, it's all worth it
Land on your tail, break it down, it's all word
Laid on the floor, is you drunk? We all stupid
Fuck you to sleep, it was love, it's all good
How many days have I died? We all losers
Laid in the streets, said "Five", it's call cap

Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya
Lay in the field, burn it down, we all herb

[Amindi:]
I can call this face out
The breakup with a breakdown
Been tryna find a way out
I'm waitin' for the catch
Maybe call you up soon
But Jake, got me like "Just cool"
What I want and must do
They don't always match
Runnin' for the hills when it gets rough
Show me, sure is feelin' like a setup
I'ma be a isolated mess
Just to look as good as it gets
Nothin' less when I mess up

[Isaiah Rashad:]
Yeah, who on the edge, it's the funds, it's all Ubers
Starvin' a child, it's a check, it's all hers
We could've died, there was shots, they don't know it
Sparin' a child goin' wild
Yeah, AMG in the dark, it's all motor
Crashin' the Jeep, it's fine, it's all hers
Fuck it, it's robbers, who shot us all posted
Spillin' the drink, goin' wild

Screamin' at home, and no phones, we all hurtin'
Freakin' ya soul, like the pack, we all herb
Pay me to feel, what the fuck, we all need ya
Mixin' the feel with the facts, we all hurt
Play in the dirt, we are at the sunseeker
If I'ma die, make it big, we all hurtin'
Tell me it's real, like the front, we all need ya

I been focused on my one-of-one
And I hope your pussy good as my bank account (What you said?)
Ayy, bitch, can I break you off? Trunk wavin' at the mall
Hoes on your side of town hate when they ain't involved
Geeked on my brudda pack, beat and I'm overcharged (Yeah)
Hurt, what I'm servin' in it, spread like the word of God
Fuck what a nigga do, reach for some inner peace
Geeked on my side of town, dope when I'm slidin' down
Ghost when I'm slidin' down, Ghost when I'm slidin' down
Porsche when I'm slidin' down (What you said?)

Keep it bad, pop a tag, go and let it air out
Drop it fast, let it spazz, go and let your hair down

Flip a pack and make a bun, when it done, I link up
Get ahead like you a geek, show no face if you discreet
Come and put this drink on me if you wanna link up

Woah, Kenny

Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)
Play right, play right, God damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna hold up the night, God damn it (Ee-ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, God damn it
Keeping score tonight (Ride, ride, ride, ride with you)

Mm, just wanna ride-ride with you
Shoot and I would die-die with you
Pain you gotta notice (You gotta notice)
War scars and more shit (I got some more)
You got some baggage, emotions (You need to)
Crash and control issues
Lagging and loading
Heart was too open
I put that over peace
You know I'd rather ride-ride with you
But would you do it for the guy?
I'm never outta reach
You know I wanna ride-ride with you
Or I'd keep that shit alive
Meanwhile, I'm racing daylight-daylight, I'm gone
Goddamn, I hit the freeway, get ghost, I'm lost
I noticed it was unlocked-unlocked, uh-huh

They got me at the stove
They got me like, "Don't leave us"

Play right, play right, God damn it (Oh)
Don't wanna hold up the night, God damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, God damn it
Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)

Don't wanna control ya right, God damn it
Keeping score tonight (Ride, ride, ride, ride with you)

And I just decided
You ain't worth my time
Can't get you off my mind
Can't risk, little that I given up
But you move in silence
They know you dirty, you private
You over your time limit
Baby, you know you have to score
You know every day a nigga get right-right with you
Baby make it hard to get-get right-right with you
Overtime, can't get right
Did too much out of spite
Did too much, can't get right, get right

Ride or die, I (Ayy) really wanna slide (Ayy)
Feelin' way high on a highway light
Pull over and try to put some points on the board
Both my hands tied, but I still keep score
Play for the same squad, never leave her
We both put up points, think I need her
Hop out all brown, she a cheetah
That dress make you pop like believer
Play right, play right, goddamn
I be here from daylight to night, I am
Tuck like the moon in the sky just waiting on my ship
Know I'm gon' score, I'm just waiting on my peace, so
Play right, play right you know
I'ma leave my heart out, heart out, on the floor
I try to get you done up-done up, uh-huh

They got me at the store
They got me like, "Don't leave her"

Play right, play right, God damn it (Oh)
Don't wanna hold up the night, God damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, God damn it
Keeping score tonight (Alright, alright)
Play right, play right, God damn it (Ayy)
Don't wanna hold up the night, God damn it (Ee-ayy)
Don't wanna control ya right, God damn it
Keeping score tonight (Ride, ride, ride, ride with you)

Who's that creeping in my- Who- Who's that-
Who's that- Who- (Too much of it) Yeah, bitch

Who's that creeping in my window? Who's- Who's that-
Who's that fucking with my conscience? I was
Who's that creeping in my window? Who's- Who's that-
Who's that fucking with my conscience? I was

Chain swangin', still empty, fuck it
Hoes choosin', still empty, fuck 'em
I don't even like Henny, fuck it
Night rider, still drinkin', duckin'
Skydivers, loose cannons, cousins
Real addicts, full-timers, buzzin'
Close ranger, Range Rover, stuffin'
Don't waste it, no chaser (Who's- Who's-)

Who's that fucking with my conscience? I was
Who's that creeping in my window? Who's- Who's that-

Intriguin', sound checking, perfect
Soul searchin', no purpose, purchase
Been an addict, been starvin', thirsty
Still greedy, don't tease me, servin'
I'm mobbin' to the beach
Top down, loud sound, see my peeps
Smoke a pound, stomach growl, let me feast
I need-need everything in my reach, that's what we preach
My niggas know I'm loco
Don't tell Rashad he's a star on the low-low
And raising bars like Lamar on the pogo
I'm selling art, sellin' souls by the bo-go at the dojo

Who's that creeping in my window? Who's- Who's that-
Who's that fucking with my conscience? I was
Who's that creeping in my window? Who's- Who's that-

Is there a Heaven? (Yes)
How do you know that? (You don't)

Yeah, yeah
I hope it all makes sense to ball like this, the large address
Ain't nothing stoppin' me but parking fees
Many hands settle down
If you don't ever get yourself straight, who the fuck is you gon' help, main?
I pray for many Thanksgivings, I pray that Tisha don't cook
You know her mama'll put sugar in they greens
That's that shit I never seen before
Bucket list, scratchin' off some shit you ain't never dreamed before
Sparkle up your pinky toe
Ayy, baby, I have no reason to stay, baby
My dream too big for this city
And Myrtle Beach ain't vacation
I can't go far as Nevada, say I only seen Vegas
If not these niggas, bet your senses betray ya
I need a day or
Two hoes plottin' on my cellular phone
I'm on speed dial, I'm your favorite problem, ya bitch smokin'
Meanwhile, went and got my tolerance thick
With that Stephen Curry arm reach
Oh, we always on top

Slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah
And slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah

Your face was blizzard, are you numb enough again?
How I sang it with that purple Power Ranger in my Benz
It's a Jeep, but I'm gon' get it
I'm still Rocem when I visit
Don't you dig into it deeper than that prophet, this is sinners
It's a long time comin'
Somehow, I always keep it peaceful when my kumbuya hunnids
Always looking for a good time, Sunny, that just my first name
Don't holler 'bout your father incentive, it's just a birthday
And a warning for repeatin' a cycle would be the worst way
Them hoes always callin' my number like it's a jersey
Them hoes always treatin' my Johnson like he a person
No matter what could happen, what happened to havin' purpose?
Translate for you scratchin' the surface
Motherfucker, I need my payback

Slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah
And slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, babe

You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
I should just pack up my bags and get loaded
She sick and tired of distance, I'm a ghost
This ain't the time of my life, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
Have I been cheatin' myself? I'm implodin'
She's sick and tired of, "Listen, I'm broke"
This ain't the time of my life, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
(You were never a human bein')
I should put all of my trust in religion
I've hit the pavement and busted my nose
This ain't as hard as it gets, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
This ain't as hard as it gets, but I'm still on drugs (You were never a human bein')
Just that weekend buzz (Weekend buzz)
(You were never) This ain't as hard as it gets, still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz

We work to work, you late to work, I holla, then they send it (Why?)
You know my plot was colder than Chicago in December (Ayy, yeah, yeah)
My bitch came up in Inglewood, her mama was her daddy
And when I'm in the Midwest, she say holla at your family (Holla at me)
My dog pass me that cup (What it do?), taste like candy, bitch (Yeah)
My dog out layin' down the law, ain't breakin' no laws or serving out the rock (Bitch)

Lil' hotbox smokin' our jar, now I'm fuckin' on a star, hold up, I got a call (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot
Roll the window, let the propane outside
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts (Yeah), yeah
Got the money in a headlock, big dog
Every time we hit the red lights, just shine
It ain't nothin' but a good day, don't die
They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot (Pat Dawg)

A mill' in the bank, what was I thinkin'?
Pistol in hand, mix with the drankin'
You the big dawg, who is you spankin'?
Police tipped off, them on my door bangin'
Said it was murder but Project is innocent
Laid up with a girl, sippin' on Hennessy
Rap game, mane, sweeter than cinnamon
Put your mob on, who does it benefit?
OG love me 'cause I'm a good earner
Country ride with me now with the burner
I just got out here, a student, a learner
I'm a bread flipper, pancake turner, turner
Cop all them business to dollars
Fly like they swallow, poppin' my collar, turner
Cop all them business to dollars
Fly like they swallow, poppin' my collar, turner

And bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot

They ain't teach 'em how to pump fake, big shot (Let's go)

I'm a big shot
Rollin' weed out a gallon size ziploc
Niggas come through thinkin' that the shit not
They careers over went quicker than a TikTok
We used to slang base like a kickbox
Glock .19, we don't kickbox
I remember when a nigga didn't have time, now a couple hundred thousands on my wristwatch (Bitch)
I'm shinin' (Yes, sir)
Every now and then, gotta remind 'em (Remind 'em)
I got shooters on my team like I signed 'em (Mm-mm)
Say you want smoke, that's all a nigga know
They gon' wipe a nigga nose like a sinus
Starin' at the Rolls Royce roof, tell 'em aim for the stars, lil' nigga, don't settle (Don't settle)
You can never rain on my parade, my cars come with the umbrella
I said, I'm a top dawg, can't match my speed
This a Lamborghini not an SRT
I ain't never met no bitch I need and I never let a broke bitch hit my weed
No way, I'm too high for your bitches, can't locate
Hatin' on me ain't never been okay
I put the squeeze on these niggas like Colgate, let's go

Bitches say that I'm a cool cat, fuck that
Tell them bitches I'm a Top Dawg, get shot (Uh-huh)
Roll the window, let the propane outside (Yes, sir)
Bunch of niggas doin' donuts, yeah (Let's get it)

Way before he ever had to buy a condom
If he buy a condom, it's to fuck the world
She done screwed a lot of niggas at the bottom
We was kids hittin' backflips, on them pissy ass mattresses
Practicin' then flower, before I [?]
Knocking wheels off axis'
Act as if we fine, pour a cup of that Activis
I coulda been me an activist
We see them acts of crime
Ended up as a catalyst
For all the motherfuckin' madness'
Shattering my mind
Dark times my nigga
We was s'possed to be the light bearers
When my partner died, I ain't even had time to cry
It was in morning havin' night terrors
And I never addressed it, I don't write letters
Once you get the grieving you're a goner
I ain't pussy, push me if you wanna
See my lil' woadie keep it on 'em
(Lil' bitch my woadie)

[Isaiah Rashad:]
I got some favors on me
Don't cross the line, talkin' bout
I got some favors on me
Don't cross the line

M-My woadie keep that ratchet he might kill a motherfucker
My woadie got that ratchet he might kill a motherfucker
My woadie got that ratchet he might kill a motherfucker
My woadie got that ratchet
My woadie got that ratchet
Bitch

My woadie-, might kill a motherfucker
My woadie-, might kill a motherfucker
My woadie-, might kill a motherfucker
My woadie, My woadie, My woadie
