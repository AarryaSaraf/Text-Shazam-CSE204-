// Rope // Rosegold //

[Part 1 - Rope:]

[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
Let's testify, that this world has
Uhm-hm, yeah

[Hook: Isaiah Rashad + (SiR)]
When I'm sober I might testify
That this world has fallen out of place
For the few that always touch the sky
I don't want space ships, I miss my roses
And I won't call you, cause I'm too fake
Like nowadays, I barely might know myself
But thank God I found this rope (I love you)
Yeah (I love you, I love you)
Barely know myself
But thank God I found this rope (I love you)
(I love you, I love you)

[Verse: Isaiah Rashad + (SiR)]
Then my dad did call me yesterday
(My daddy called me that day)
And he cried and cried into my phone
(Oh how he cried and cried)
Bout the love that kind that he forgot
Since he left his family all alone
I don't know why I feel all in grey
And I know my heart ain't built to be
But I came back and forth
To chase my tracks and roll with
I ain't supposed to know here
Some go, her face so shy
Her friends so cold, ohh
Some go a place so high
And friends so cold
I love you, I love you, I love you

[Part 2 - Rosegold:]

[Intro: Isaiah Rashad]
This the fancy car that keeps me padded
Glad to have you back my nigga
(I know it)
Knew you was gonna make it back to this roof
(Eyes, and they shine)

[Verse: Isaiah Rashad & Ro$egold]
Alright scramble, for the ammo
Can we build, can we chill?
Can I live with my kids?
Deuce, poof, proof
Lord I, I can't feel the joy
I can't fill the void
Let, let her fill the void
Too, too young to ignore
But really if we don't make it out the city
If we don't make it to the finish line
If I don't make it to your titties
I got the music for the vibers, I got the music for the vibers
And we don't usually talk about it
It's like you debatin' with a bible, I'm really preachin' to the choir
I brought the music for the vibers though
And in the chalice that keeps me low as your moral is
Ay you just smokin' on the cabbage
I see you fuckin' with the gravity
I been waitin' for a challenge
Besides waitin' for the balance, and the apricot
And to rap with Dot, and I laugh a lot
I got some old hoes, ha, and some new friends
And some rose gold, and some, and some rose gold

[Outro: Isaiah Rashad & Ro$egold]
(You are the fancy car that keeps me goin')
I know you hear me talkin' to you nigga
(I know ya)
I know you can hear me nigga
(You are the fancy car that keeps me goin')
Give a fuck
(I know ya)
Niggas be floatin' around
(I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes and they shine like 1999)
(I got my eyes on ya)
(I got my eyes and they shine like 1999)
(Like 1999)
Only so fuckin' long you can ignore me my nigga, don't
Fuckin' you Rashad, fuckin' hear me dog, motherfucker

// Wat's Wrong //

[Intro:]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 1 - Isaiah Rashad:]
Cut my hair and bump my head and fell on top
And run on sins, and front on friends
If we don't win then pay your Tithes and mend your fins
And we alright, the KO kins on big o' rims
And LA hoes, if that ain't rolled up, I ain't go
I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them
No more ends and no more trends
And photo tint and photo lens, notice this
Pour this shit, bonafide, woe is me
Bowl of grease, naked pimp, beamin' up, clean as fuck
Other side chill for niggas, makin' life look clear for niggas
Hill for niggas, tip top cliff for niggas, this the vision side to side
So give the nigga, if we honest you gon' miss a nigga
Twisted with 'em, this the isms
See your bitch might kiss a nigga, which nigga? Get specific
Big ass pot, wrist is glistened, your list is shit
And your, if it isn't, let's call some titties and scar your face
The robe of wrongs has caught a case
Other niggas they mob like Cartise from far away
All my niggas like "Calm down"
Lovin' life above a reason, just can't find it like a dozen people
Catch that vibe at night, and Bobby Whitney
Get too tired to write and died in prison
Felt like Rob tonight, lost my god tonight?

[Hook - Zacari:]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my belt
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
How many souls do you touch a day?
How many hoes do you fuck a day?
How many flows do your thought convey?
How many know you can't walk away?
Depending on the way I feel, I might kill everybody around me
Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, at the debris and never let me in
I kick back with kick though
Maybe if I could live a hundred years that be real?
Pay me if Imma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy my others, yeah, wait 'til my momma knew
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now I got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shot gun
I bring your weekend to an end and pop one
I'm in the deep end, boss nigga you not one
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our son?
I made enough residuals to hide some
I gave enough, my niggas know I divide some
I told Zay, I'm the best rapper since twenty five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego was Gemini
He and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
I proceed my last check in proceeds
To all the kids, the hood, the bricks, the books
To fix the blocks we on to right my wrongs
The word, to give the life we live as I get...

[Hook - Zacari:]
...so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my belt
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now

[Verse 3 - Isaiah Rashad:]
Oh you got two Xannies, oh, just don't forget me
Love me for the moment (all in the air now) hug me like a sibling
We ain't that important, vice cops in the kitchen
Grew with Apollonia (all in the air now) Rob was makin' chicken
Beat me down, you beat me down, reorganize my face
Now when I go home, I don't know what my fam gon' say
They say it ain't love cause you bought flowers yesterday
Thoughts was always cheap, cheap, cheap
But now let's talk 'bout me, me, me, me, me
Lately I been comin', this ain't goin' how I wanted
When I pull up at your window, bitch come out, you hear that beep, beep, beep
Faithful as your EBT, closer than you momma can
Anger when you rang up, I'm a  dog but I'm gon' crawl again
Freak me out, keep me out, why they always leave me out
Niggas that been hatin'  just can't wait to have my CD now
Don't we look like CP and Nirvana on that keep me pound
Please be down, I been more than late...

[Hook - Zacari:]
Oh sometimes I get so ahead of myself
Feel like I'm runnin' in circles
Oh and I'm just holdin' onto my belt
I need smoke just to exhale
Oh and I get so ahead of myself
But I'll make it out somehow
So roll another, roll another one
And put it all in the air now
All in the air now

[Outro - Dave Free:]
I called to tell you the story of...when a few years, I gave my pops, uh, Cilvia, Cilvia Demo and my pops said uh...he listened to it for about a week, came back to me said uh...dang boy, why...they talkin' 'bout he gon' run up in somebody house...he...he talkin' 'bout you?

// Park //

Mama I knew I was 'bout it
Way before venue was crowded
Way before Kevin pulled up with that Reverend
I told him to level, go fuck on the feelings
Don't nut on her face
Trust me I feel like the man
Trust me I feel like the Wop, rock
You can depend on the stock, watch
Bitch I got ten in the pot, drop
All of my limits could die
All of y'all niggas
All of my limits could die
Look at you timid as fuck
And you holding me up
And I'm trying to be Nicki Minaj
Rich as a bitch in the drop
Rich as a bitch, rich as my bitch on the side
Hoe I got more than you know, hoe I got
Look, watch, spill out your soul in the closet
Don't question your passion
We flipped every fucker we couldn't be ashing
They got me so high that I look like I'm passive
Bitch, don't you know who you asking?
Bitch have you tutored the pastor
I know the root and the master
I know the coupe was a casket
I had that bitch looking like all the shit that I'm writing
That shit was so good that I passed it
Bust that shit straight out the plastic
Bitch I ain't good bitch I'm crafty
I want to piss on a rapper
I just got hookers and pampers
Niggas line up when I practice
I'm not a savage, I don't do shit just to do it
This going precise as we planned it
I'm just a bandit, plus I'm as sharp as a tack or a guillotine right at your family
Keep it so candid, knock ya like she said some candy
You down for this shit or you Brandy
Find a mechanic, tell 'em I pay 'em in fabric
3500 in traffic

Nigga I'm savage
I look more Cuban than Maverick, the metal, the tube of the handle
Nigga I'm savage, wait (hey)
Wait, look, nigga I'm savage
I look more Cuban than Maverick, the metal, the tube of the handle
Nigga I'm savage
I look more Cuban than Maverick, the metal, the tube of the handle
Nigga I'm swaging
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Nigga what's happening?
Niggas won't piss on your grave
Bitch I might piss on your family
Nigga what's happening?
Bitch I might shoot at your camera
Bitch I might shoot at your
Nigga what's happening?
I look more Cuban than Maverick, the metal, the tube of the handle
Nigga I'm savage

Back-back, to the back-back, to the frozens and the BB's
Way before ya, way before ya thought I told ya
It's alot on the line
These hoes wanna ride on the line
These hoes ain't no bible of mine
Back-back, to the back-back, to the frozens and the BB's
If sixteen ain't enough
I could swing it twenty-five
I could tell ya how to go
I could tell you where to ride
I could tell you where the

[Kari Faux:]
Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switchin' time zones
Lost in the sauce now I'm shootin' where I stand
You can't call me back if you can't pay me in advance
Ridin' down the street with the hazard lights on

// Silkk Da Shocka //

Yeah I almost got this
At least we got it memorized
This for the haves and the haves wanna give a fucks, hey

I ride around in your car
I put my weed in your blunt
I am the sky to your star
I am the end of your month
You are the start of my day
You brought the smile from my face
I see the world from your eyes
You pulled a thorn from my side

I know you love me
It's rare I know you love me
But yeah I know you love me
It's rare I know you love me

You give me all that you got
You make it stretch it and flip
I fell in love with your thighs
I learned it's more than your hips
You know I'm caught in my vibe
But I still give you my rib
You hear them callin' my name
But know it's hard for me here
I'm left at home by myself
I chose the world in the end
I say you know I be back
You try your best to pretend
I say you all that I want
And when I make it, it's real
I hear 'em callin' my name
It's gettin' hard for me here

To know you love me
It's rare to know you love me
But yeah I know you love me
It's rare I know you love me

And these stars are nothin' but your cousins
And starin' at your mama in heaven was a father
So holla you heard I'm usin' narcotics
I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few gripes but it's only about a dollar
Feel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna be here if I don't gotta
My weed habit so close to snortin' powder
Got a few bitches but it's only bout a dollar
Feel so hollow unless you're usin' narcotics
See I don't wanna

Listen me in this motherfucker [?]

[Verse 1 - Isaiah Rashad:]
I'm just one dirty motherfucker
I hurt myself way more than you
This too much out here for the cup
I put that codeine in my soup
Used to spit in granny face, I'm supposed to show you love
I don't need no picket line and I don't need no fuckin' hug
You just rappin' just because
With your napkin full of drugs
Too exclusive in the back
Should we sneak them in the club
Who is that nigga if I ain't that nigga?
It ain't thing poppin' if I ain't with Robert
Gotta consider my liver my nigga
Gotta get rid of my kidney my nigga
That was the only thing holding me back
None of these niggas ain't tellin' me shit
Lately I've only been bumpin' that Yachty
All this Burberry on top of my body
I know that some day would get me that 'Rarri
Pullin' up tryna tell me the truth

Condoms, weed, and lotion, wavy like the ocean
I got no emotions, dolo in the function
You ain't in my section, you can't tell me nothin'
She just wanna sip on the real pink soda
Ride with a big billed .40
Slide through the hood I know it's all good
I ain't from the set but I still got soldiers
Seven when I roll the dice, Henny straight, hold the ice
Lately I don't take advice
Claimin' we don't live for twice, seen to a poltergeist
Treat the beat like I planned a heist

You get whatever you wish long as your coin is right, right
Wake up to the real tamale
So ill might kill somebody just for GP
Be me with a white bitch
Waitin' around the corner in a Mustang GT

My crystal ball show your future when I cruise up
Now listen, all I want is gravy for my steak bitch

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga
Ain't a damn thing parked outside
Size of my cup, nigga I'm Gucci
Size of my hair, nigga I'm Boosie
Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

But thank God I got my bank, where I keep my heart inside
And I keep it far away from all these hoes and flashin' lights
I'm like Remy with the whip, I'm not Oprah with these hoes
And I keep a snoopy broad because it keep me on my toes
We been ridin' for ten exits and I still been in your door
We get better by the steps so if I ever let you go
Baby you classy, baby you got it

Nigga burnt out, can't even catch fire no more
Figured it was just a West Side movie

I was billin' in the back, I was chillin' in the back
Cause I always really wanna be that nigga in the back
You don't live it really, I can show you how to live
But I promise I can show a pussy nigga how to act
Junked out smokin' from the side door
With a bitch I wanted in the eighth grade
Hope you got an ass like Nori
Hope you pussy niggas never see me
This is why I never wanna feed ya
Cause I can tell you bitches got a limit
I can be subjective 'bout you fuckin' up the highway
You fuckin' up the ride, why you fuckin' up the heist?
I remember lookin' from the outside
I remember workin' up the work day
I remember nigga havin' nothin' but my momma
And some starter on my mothafuckin' birthday, birthday
Baby can I live it like a body?
Let my momma smoke it 'til she finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It's been a long day, I'm in a high 10:30
All my niggas tell me that they want it
Hope I see my niggas at the finish
Let a nigga sip it all alone babe
It's been a long day, I'm in a high 10:30

This life I live like, baby don't drink like
Baby don't think too much, don't drive
I got here, I can't even tell my nigga

(My nigga made sure you were [?] for real)
(How could you ever pop a pill pack)
I won't let you go
(My nigga made sure you were [?] for real)
(How could you ever pop a pill pack)

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no, no way
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
Cause who's ashamed
So I might testify

I got a face that only your bitch could love
Your type niggas don't mix with us
Ain't this special like just because
Backpack full of that wrist and lung
Boarding pass, pass my troubles
High as fuck, lost my wallet
Going back, back to Cali
Saw my son, miss my daughter
Real life
What does it feel like?
I got my pills on
You know I'm real numb
Gettin' ready for this motherfucker

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
Cause who's ashamed
So I might testify

I can't admit
I've been depressed, I hit a wall, ouch
I hit the bank, you hit the dab
I hit the ball out
Praying God pay my cable
Splurging out one more favor
Little boys dressed like rappers
Can that road make them daddies?
I talked to God
I got approved, I got a life now
If I should die
While I'm awake, I had a nice time

I control the speed and I won't let you go, no away
You're everything I love
(Everything I love, how could you ever say no?)

And if I make to the gates and he don't recognize

And the road to the vision is all communication
And we bust a nut
I left a stain in your inner part
You let it go
I know the words to your favorite
We know everything
But I don't have time for you baby
I am all for the profit, I am past my self-destruction
But you bring it back

Cause you describe all the symptoms of a common fiend
You said you read to the fire

Would you testify?
