Album: WeveBeenGoingAboutThisAllWrong

// Darkness Fades //

Rain
Sleep tonight
Sunrise
Hold hands all night

It's been a while since I held you close
Been a while since we've touched
All the doors close
I've seen the fall
I've seen you undone
Been writing on the dust
I'm hearing stars fall
Keeping what at bay?

Here I'm standing
Partly here
Here I stare around the room
Pray home they

I'm looking at our grass
I'm struggling for words
I'm dreaming of a place
I held close in a state
Darkness fades

The nights are now
Better stay, light
I'm looking for a way
Darkness fades

// Home To Me //

The only child, don't turn your back, don't leave
You're on my mind, do you not see?

I need my job, please, don't hold that against me
You are my life, ooh, don't that sting?

Oh, my child, you throw it back to me
You hold my time, you hold right back indeed

I take my time, so you can say to me
"What makes it right is an unknown thing"

You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me
You come home to me

// I'll Try //

My hell in drive
My heart in, like, a fog
I hear them now
Every time I cross the park
Believe the death
Karma, your life
Come what fear undone
My life on the path

Don't state a direction
Like who my blood won't save
Anyone on a mission
To fear a life, no love
It crossed my mind
I'd "try"
Let's go march
I'll go downtown

Wear my protection
By ways no one can judge
The lack of conviction
Change the ways of the number one

And I'll try
I'll try
I'll try

Worldwide intervention on the "do not touch"
It's too much
But I'll try
Try
I'll try

Cross my heart
Cross my heart
I'll...

// Anything //

Up the whole night
Undefined
Can't stop thinking 'bout peace and war
Up the whole night
Right before
The sun takes everything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything

Up the whole night
Underline
Chain-smoking, like, no, it ain't right
Afternoon beer
Understand
It could've been anything
It could've been anything
I didn't feel anything

You love him by the stove light in your arms
He is there because he can't stand the sad eyes

I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything
I couldn't feel anything

// Born //

I was never like her
I laugh as I am knocked down
Turned your face like I always did
When I was taking my time

I knew where I was born
I knew where I was blamed by the world

Where have you been?
You were with your wishes
What could have been?
If a wish was kisses

One night, I walked into a situation that I could have avoided
But it turned into something my babe noticed ain't right

It was something like a window and I wanted to break free
You showed me a false halo, there will be no walking back
I walk away, my head turned

I wanted to break
Something like an innocent child
Walking by fire
Not another bullet in vain

// Headspace //

Eyes on screen to left of me
All the clouds are wrapped around your brain
Hardly see what's next to you
Can't you see I'm trying to get through?

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

I want to touch you in the dark
Put your lips on neck to me
Hold yourself up against me
Don't stop
Pull my hips, remind you, see
Ten year old white cotton briefs want play

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

I wanted to feel ageless
I wanted to be here
I wanted to feel ageless
I wanted to feel here

Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby, don't turn your back to me
Baby

// Come Back //

Wall eyes
Ceiling felt too high
Nights were falling down skies
Was no look in the eyes
Subtle moments of past
What a wondering time

Come back

Swallowed over the stage
Turning into the rage
Wondering what forced the age towards tomorrow

Come back
Come back
Was wild and unsure
And naked and pure
Come back

Turning into the fear
Never something was here
Turning over my mind
Jumping on tenuous time

Come back
Come back
Moments of faith turning out late
Come back

Leaning over the stairs
Tryin' to see what is there
Or does anyone care?
Ominous state

Come back
Come back
Neighboring love won't stay in the home
Come back

Come back
Come back
Moments of fire can turn the car on back home

// Darkish //

Turn me back and you will say
"Here is what you have
Only in the stars you saw
Harmony is all you'll see
And home is what you hold
And what you have to hold is what you wanted"

"Cruel," he said, once
It's always once

All is harmony
It's once, it's all, it's done
And crazy as can be
It's not dark, it's only darkish
Waiting
Tell me this one thing
Calling out to where?
Where will we be when our world is done?
It's done
Darkish inside of me

// Mistakes //

I walk down the road
Let my body wake up by the way
You'll move
Skate 'round the room
See my body ache, my body shake
Boom, boom

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake, mistake
It's much better than that

I dance like Elaine
But my baby takes me to the floor
Says, "More, more"
Eyes close to stares
My baby takes, my body shares
Lights flare

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake, mistake
It's much better than that

When I make a mistake
Turns out it's great, it's great, it's great
I'm much better than that
It's much better than that

Even when I make a mistake
Even when I make a mistake, mistake
Turns out it's great
Even when you're late, you're late, you're late
It's much better than that
It's much better than that
It's much better than that

// Far Away //

Been down on myself
Said won't go back
Been there
My mother might say you were right

Doesn't matter where she is, not far
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone
Long
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost

Sitting there, wet mess
We held till the sun came up
Are you aware, last steps realize?

Doesn't matter where she is, not far
I'll be here for a little while
Then not gone
Long
Don't know what it is so far
I'll be here
Not only when you feel long lost

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away

Long gone, I'll see you far away
Long gone, I'll see you far away

// Never Gonna Change //

Forever turns into today
Haven't found a way to make it brave
It never goes away
Think I need to step away to say

It never goes away, never goes away
See my son begin to change
Never go away

Deepened in the waves
Sheltered, saw to it don't waste away
Same old thoughts awake
Shame my voice and try to trace the chains

I'm never gonna change, I'm never gonna change
I hear my voice deepens as it pains
Never gonna change, I'm never gonna change
I hear my voice deepens as it pains
Never go away

I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change
I'm never gonna change

Ooh...

// Porta //

Cross the lines, you don't know who's lookin'
Up ahead, another one who's bookin'

Want to hear myself, wanna be there
Wanna stay but I don't want to leave it
Want to hold head up, don't want to stay down
I want to live my life

But you won't allow
Stalker wanna be like "I don't want to hear that"

I want to be myself, want to be there
You want to rip my style, and want to be there
You want to hear my love, want to be there
You want to steal my life

I want you to stop trying
To get in the door
That you step through

I want to be myself
Don't let him find us, don't want that life
Think straight. Get by
Gotta think straight to get by
Think straight. Get by

Want to be myself, you wanna be my
Want to be myself, you wanna be my
Want to be myself, you wanna be my

I want to be myself

(Stay out of my life...)
(Stay out of my life...)
(Stay out of my life...)
(Stay out of my life...)

// Used To It //

Hand, skin
The memory lies
Safe at the helm of reunion
Play the part
Similar blood
Where are you going, you rainstorm?

Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Ae you used to it
Pouring out your life?

Seems your heart is criminal-like
Sitting on the fences of real life
Haunted by your love affair
Staring down the eyes of our nature

Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?

Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?

// When I Die //

I was talking to myself
Wondering how I was going to die
Will I see the outside?
And would I realize?

Will you take me to the movies if I can't run?
Will you see me make mistakes I never used to?

I was walking in а field
Waiting to be near
I was reaching for daylight
A memory I was supposed to be

Yeah, I want to remember
And I want to do so much more
Yeah, I want to be much better
And I want to do so much more

I was talking in my sleep
Every secret that I keep
Can't say what's on my mind right now
Can't save me like an old sweater

Yеah, I want to remember
And I want to do so much morе
Yeah, I want to be much better
And I want to do so much more
