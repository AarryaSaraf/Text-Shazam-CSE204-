Album: RemindMeTomorrow

// I Told You Everything //

Sitting at the bar, I told you everything
You said, "Holy shit, you almost died"
Sharing a shot, you held my hand
Knowing everything, knowing everything, we cried
I told you everything about everything

I had no idea, I had no idea
We held hands, we held hands
We held hands as we parted
We knocked knees, we knocked knees as it started

I told you everything about my first time
I told you everything, no change in your eyes
I told you everything, no change in my mind

You said, "Holy shit, we almost died"
I had no idea, I had no idea

// No One's Easy To Love //

Yes, there were jerks, recalling the years of love's past
As you opened the door and told me how you love me so much
The resistance to feeling something that you put down before
But keep quiet of it as you could not fell fit anymore

Too much has changed, I can't let you walk in in the night
I wish away my love, leave with the dawn
Acting as if all the pain in the world was my fault
Leave me here, my love, don't say goodbye

No one's easy to love
Don't look down, my dear, don't be surprised
No one's easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you tried

There was a question you asked, "Is your father a man?"
Know what I think you should do? Ask of yourself the same
What is the difference between now and then? I'm not sure
Prove me wrong, my dear, don't say I lied

No one's easy to love
Don't look down, my dear, don't be surprised
No one's easy to love
Don't look back, my dear, just say you tried

// Memorial Day //

Where do you always stay? Where do you stare?
When you look, what do you see there?
Come back with your head up
When you barely stand, when you couldn't ask

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

Back, you will stay
You will learn or you will do it again
Will you ever hold your ground? Will I ever pull your teeth?
If you barely stand, how do I let you leave?

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

You, you will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)
You will run (you will run your will)

Standing, I can see
You will learn, you will run
(You will run)
(You will run your will)
(You will run your will)

// Comeback Kid //

"Hey, you're the comeback kid"
(See me look away)
I'm the runaway
I'm the stay out late
I'm recovering
Kid, at the top of our street
I was somewhat like him
I was somebody

Comeback kid!
Comeback, kid!
Come back, kid!
Let me look at you!

"Yeah, you're the comeback kid
Let me look at you"
(Then look away)
Yeah, I'm the runaway
I'm the hardly stay
Let slip away

Don't look back!
Don't look back!
Don't look back!
Watch me run away

"Kid came back a real turn around"
Please believe that I want to stay
"Got a job now that my brother found
Working nights just a mile away"
Don't let me slip away
I'm not a runaway
It just feels that way

Comeback kid!
Comeback kid!
Come back, kid!
Let me look at you!
Comeback kid!
Comeback, kid!
Come back!

// Jupiter 4 //

Our love's for real
How'd it take a long, long time
To let us feel?
Try to relate
In my state
And the aura 'round me says
"My love is for real"

Touching your face
How'd it take a long, long time
To be here?
Turning the wheel on my street
My heart still skips a beat
It's echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing, echoing

Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I wanted to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
My whole life for someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real

Baby, baby, baby
I've been searching for you
I wanted to be in love
Baby, baby, baby
I've been waiting, waiting, waiting
My whole life for someone like you
It's true that everyone would like to have met
A love so real
A love so real
A love so real
Our love so real

// Seventeen //

I know what you wanna say
I think that you're all the same
Constantly being led astray
You think you know something you don't

Downtown hotspot
Halfway up this street
I used to be free
I used to be seventeen
Follow my shadow
Around your corner
I used to be seventeen
Now you're just like me

Down beneath the ashes and stone
Sure of what I've lived and have known
I see you so uncomfortably alone
I wish I could show you how much you've grown

Downtown hotspot
Used to be on this street
I used to be seventeen
I used to be seventeen
Now you're a hotshot
Hanging on my block
Sun coming up
Who is my shadow?

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

I know what you're gonna be
I know that you're gonna be
You'll crumble it up just to see
Afraid that you'll be just like me

Downtown hotspot
Halfway through this life
I used to feel free
Or was it just a dream?
Now you're a hotshot
Think you're so carefree
But you're just seventeen
So much like me

You're just seventeen
You're just seventeen
Seventeen

// Malibu //

We held hands as we passed the truck
Just a couple of dudes who don't give a fuck
Tab the brakes and we slow down
Just a couple of jokers on the edge of town
In Malibu
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number, driving down the one

I walked in the door
The Black Crowes playing as he cleaned the floor
I thought I couldn't love him any more
In that little red number, driving down the one

Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one
In a little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one
In a little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the one

// You Shadow //

Follow me until you don't know where you are
Follow me until you don't know where you are
Closing your eyes when you're reaching with hands
Falling down flat when you don't understand who I am

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

Listen until you know what to say
Listen until you know what to say
Use loving words and be gentle and kind
Open your mind and it's easy to find where I am

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing, no
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You say that you've changed your mind
Yeah, I let you
Your side isn't on my side, walking east now

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You ain't nothing, you never won
You ain't nothing, you never done nothing wrong
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow
You don't do nothing I don't do
You shadow

// Hands //

Putting my hands up, I'm following you
I know what I've done, dear, I promise you

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up

I'm feeling the changes
I know it's just like me to say
"I want to make sense of it all"
We could handle anything when we were young

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up

The way he described you
I'm hearing your sighs sneaking out
And I wanted to tell you what you wanted to hear
But you told me to let it all out, dear

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up

// Stay //

Have you all of my lifetime
Kind hard to make light
Imagining when you're inside
When you make those kicks at night

Don't want to hurt you
Don't want to run away from myself
Want your whole star to shine on in
One star, one light
The meaning of life

You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way

Find a way to stand
And a time to walk away
Letting go to let you lead
I don't know how it ends

Comes a time when you answer
Do it with heart
Want you to express yourself
Not let it get to your head

You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way
You, you love me either way
You stay
