// Millennium Of The Blind //

Line up all of you and turn in your eyes
You just won't need them anymore
And your mind is ours to do with what we please
Everything you own and everything you need

Sacrifice you leaders
Like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship
Death on the rocks

Blind follow
Blind lead
All our hopes and dreams
Washed out to sea

All your money's ours to bankroll corrupt wars
You can't see what you're fighting for
Trust your leaders as they send you out to die
The true face of evil can't be seen without eyes

Sacrifice you leaders
Like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship
Death on the rocks

Blind follow
Blind lead
All our hopes and dreams
Washed out to sea

At the start of time
Many centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ
And the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves
They lived and they died
In the millennium of the blind

Blind follow
Blind lead
All our hopes and dreams
Washed out to sea

// Black Swan //

I thought a desire worth any pleasure
Could never really be a sin in vain
A hundred and one shots of opportunity
I'd gladly take them all again, and again, and again

My angels left me with sorrows all my own
And now I'm here with the devil all my own

Just like a churchyard shadow creeping after me
Its only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

I promised on my soul not to get carried away
It always starts out psychedelic and then it turns to black
My head starts swaying; I forgot what was it I was saying?
I don't know where I am and I'll never, never make it back

I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt; I fell from grace with deep regret

[Chorus]

There's nothing left to see, there's nothing left of me

// Sudden Death //

His wicked Highness, born from disaster, to dominate and to kill
A glistening, murder-machine; false majesty, standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg; raining down evil on a mountain of black ice
Like a good ole fashioned beating within Inches of your life

Alone and left abandoned with the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you as your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love your sudden death from above

Once frozen like a prisoner depraved, perched high atop the lithospheres
Set free from beneath the depths of hell, bequeathing man nothing but despair
The beast is genetically programmed, time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars, to see the end of the earth

Stopping at nothing, punch-drunk from the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart, not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution, your sudden death from above

[Chorus]

// Public Enemy No. 1 //

Public enemy number one
Jail break and a smoking gun
You won't believe the things I've done
And the killing is just for fun

Public enemy number one
A stolen car and I'm on the run
Through the night till the rising sun
And the trouble has just begun

Roses on your grave
I'll be on my way
There's no time to stay
With the enemies I've made

I'm invincible
You might say despicable
Punishment's reciprocal
Public enemy number one

I'm unbeatable
My mind is untreatable
Crimes unrepeatable
Public enemy number one

Public enemy number one
Watch the authorities come undone
With every stand-off that I've won
Flirting death just for fun

Public enemy number one
Born a fugitive father's son
Another heist of a bank is done
And the trouble has just begun

[Chorus]

The posters say I'm wanted "Dead or Dead"
Anyone who's tried got a bullet to the head

[Chorus]

Public Enemy [repeat 4x]

// Whose Life (Is It Anyways?) //

Ooh, you're just in time to get inside my head
Ooh, the war of words you're underneath my skin

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows

You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in a mirror?

Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live, but who asked you anyway
Hey! Just whose life is this anyway?
Cost so much more than the price I ain't going pay

You only point out fault; anxiety attack
You running your mouth, you stab me in my back

[Chorus]
