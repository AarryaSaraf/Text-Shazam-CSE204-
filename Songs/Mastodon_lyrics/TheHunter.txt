// Black Tongue //

I burned out my eyes
I cut off my tongue
I sealed them with all of the silver
And now I have none

You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the...

You own the darkness
And taken my sight
You buried the stars underground
You've stolen the night

You can run to the sea
You can run to the forest
You can hide
But you'll never escape

You've run out of lies
You've run out of time

You killed the life
You took the diamond
You killed the vine
Death of the sun

// Curl Of The Burl //

I killed a man 'cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, 'cause they can't hear a sound

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Splinters in my skin, just like needles and pins
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives
Been out here for days running through these trees
I'm using my hands, cuttin' through the disease

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

I feed the powerless
Chewed it up, spit the rest
I feed the powerless
Chewed it up, spit out the rest

It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh

// Blasteroid //

Change your hair
Change your clothes
I'll rearrange your face for you

If you can breathe
When I am through
I'll give it all right back to you

I wanna drink your fucking blood
I wanna break your fucking jaw
I wanna squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it all

Change your name
Change your eyes
Become the one who I despise

If you are sad
And need to cry
Then turn around and go outside

I wanna drink your fucking blood
I wanna break your fucking jaw
I wanna squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it all

// Stargasm //

The temple of bodies
A building with souls
Given the cosmos
As we let go
As we let go

Locked in a dance
Surrounding the moon
This far from the clouds
Stargasm flows
Stargasm

Lead us by horses
On the way to our graves
Father the owl
It is your faith
It is your faith

Awake in the moment
Awaken the heart
Look to the spirits
Stargasm glows
Stargasm

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire

Henged from solstice
Bohemian grove
Flesh lies the altar
As we let go
As we let go

Glasses are empty
The owl has flown
Sever relation
Like you didn't know
Like you didn't know

And then we shift into overdrive
But you're not here
And your legs and the stars collide
You're on fire
You're on fire
You're on fire

// Octopus Has No Friends //

To tempt the fool into the mine
Let loose the snake with antidote

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

I see your face inside the smoke
It's hard to scream and nice to choke

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

Let's rest awhile inside the cave
Don't cry you'll see that we'll be safe

Take the hand
Guide the way
Far away
Find the truth
Always
Always

Take your heart into your hand
Always
Take your heart into your hand
Always

I'm on my way back home
I'm on my way back home

// All The Heavy Lifting //

Lift you up again, give you to the trees
All sound and visions are what they ask of me
Let's run fast through the fields, over mountain tops
Let's swim through ocean water, and we'll never stop

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when

Can you show me where to find the stream
I've been told before that the water's clean
Will you come with me, two of us can drink
Move quick, we've got to hurry
There's no time to think

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when

We didn't come this far just to turn around
We didn't come this far just to run away
Just ahead, we will hear the sound
The sound that gives us a brand new day

Just close your eyes
And pretend that everything's fine
Just close your eyes
I'll tell you when

// The Hunter //

All the love I've shown
Given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
All the life I've known
Given to the life I've shown
Along the way

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go your spirit flies

All the love I've shown
Given to the ones I've known
All the love I make
Is equal to the love I take
The light is fading fast
Be careful of the ones you left
Along the way

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go your spirit flies

The thorns are on the road
The thorns are on the road

In the morning light
The sparrow flies
When the moon devours us
The planet dies

Free from it all
Breathe in the darkest fall
We laugh and cry through a brother's eyes for now

Through fire embers glow
Haunted I lift the stone
Letting go your spirit flies

// Dry Bone Valley //

Head down running from the beast
Breakneck speed taking all my breath
Black feet scraped and scarred and dripping blood
Rain come down, take me with your flood

I came to and I was running from you
Feel your breath on the back of my neck

Where have I come to be
Is this all that's left for me

I wish that I was still there
I want to keep on breathing

Bulls roar loud
Snakes move past my feet
No teeth, no hands, set me free
Bones start rattling 'round inside my head
I don't know if I'm alive or dead

I came to and I was running from you
Feel your breath on the back of my neck

Where have I come to be
Is this all that's left for me

I wish that I was still there
I want to keep on breathing

Dig deep, kicking up rock and dirt and sand
Out of this lifeless valley, bones in hand
Over these mountains to the seas of life
Leave this desert for the sick and damned

// Thickening //

With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

Love your warm embrace
Hold me close don't let me go
Nipple pink and cold
Filled up with mother's milk

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

With the lights down low
Wrapped up like a baby
And your hair hangs long
Surrounding my face

Straight out of nowhere
Buried deep inside my past
Straight out of nowhere
Hoping you'll be the last

// Creature Lives //

I saw the creature fall
Into the swamp from which he spawned
I heard them laugh and say
They never liked him anyway

I tried to talk to them
To help you on your feet again
They laughed and said to me
The swamp is right where I should be

The creature lives
The creature lives
The creature lives
The creature lives

// Spectrelight //

We trip the light
Firebird flies
Burn your inside

Given a lesson
The path I've shown
Follow all I know

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

It came from the ocean
Gift of the sea
Lava forms the stone

Belief in power
Believe the dream
Trust your own truth

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

You listen through the light
Tolling on the sea
Barren eyes behind you
Leave the shadows waking dreams
Rising through the door
Writhing with a knife
Cut speech
Cut light
Cut chord
And break the dawning wretch of silence

Trust your own truth

Souls of the fallen
Death of the godhead
Listen and breathe

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

// Bedazzled Fingernails //

Give and take
We are full of pride
All is proved in time

Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground

Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes

Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes

Rule by my head
Endure test of time
Plant the seed of mind

Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground

Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes

Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes

// The Sparrow //

Pursue happiness with diligence...

// The Ruiner //

You take life 
Give nothing back 
You need to return what youâve stolen

You need life 
To multiply 
Devour all that surrounds you

Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it

Destroyer 
Of all thatâs good 
We donât need a death that surrounds you

The bolt strikes 
To infect 
We know your intentions are impure

Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it 
Sickness canât kill this love 
Always alive in my heart 
Sickness canât kill this love 
Always alive in my heart 
Heavy weighs the crown 
Low hangs the head who wears it

// Deathbound //

Going through the deep icy waves
Thrown in end all because death waits
Throughout during the winter
Guardian of land and sea

Standing close to the throne
Violent 'cuz I can not see

Power royalty our Presidents hanging
No one left here anymore

[Chorus:]
Icy Squall on the Tundra
Obedience how we reign
Enjoy the sights we know
Soon it will be turned

Grovel Life Expelled Become Immortal
Forceful hand, unfeeling
Groaning dead are near
Sordid tale of man

Molten rock renown
Distant brother of man
Groaning dead are near
Sordid tale of man

[Chorus]
[Chorus]
