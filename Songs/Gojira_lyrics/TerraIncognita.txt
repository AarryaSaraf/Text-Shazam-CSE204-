Album: TerraIncognita

// Clone //

Every Step you take is to the end
Chaos, duplicate the human slaves
Mother Nature so far away: Why?
Perfect is the race you dream

Right now, I make my choice
Perfection you fake is not
The soul, not a genetic code
You fools, you ignoramuses

Hatchery, the newborn to celebrate
Ashes to ashes, I see respect in the dust
Life is so perfect

Now for the weak an abortion
Celebrate perfection that grows
The flesh, a gift of science
The soul a fault of a god

Life on its way to the state of fire
From the cold taste of steel
Light embraces the dark, lava flowing free
and the cradle is...
Forgot the reasons why - We all lie so pale
On the playground of cold
Mother Nature is at saturation point
and the cradle is falling down...

// Lizard Skin //

I reserve myself the right to protect, I
from intenions around,
I see a thousand faces
In no one but myself I trust
I don't get love or care from this world of pain
Made my skin turn to stone
Bending under this load, I fall, and my skin is...

My fall accelerates with the weight
Soon I'll be underworld
Surving radiations, not for long,
and I'm burning

Raging storm deep inside,
Unsuspected misery
Someone has betrayed my trust
Attempted suicide
My nerves tensed, hardened my skin becomes
But I give my horse its head, I'll overcome
Come, meet, under my lizard skin

I research the way to cleave through the air
My attention span is too short
My envelope is too tight now
and my skin is...

// Satan Is A Lawyer //

Lawyer talks, he's so correct, he is respect
He learned how to make you feel safe
and kill you with a smile
And the food so fast, the hair so clean
The moon so far, fire so weak

All those words flying in the air
Cannot see the stars
Images, colors, like wrong perfection
Wash my brain, dirty it's so clean
But who are you?
The mixture has no smell

Soon you will sit on the bench
of those who deny I have my soul
You sell a dream you create
Condemned by what you condemned before
Smooth are the words you sing down and high
Underground is your joy your laws
Satan is a lawyer
You choose the appearance of the futile
Trapped, a coner stops your back, you're out
Before you grow you will die...

// Blow Me Away You (Niverse) //

Reverse, blow me in that black hole down there
Return through perfect circle of my retina
No Gravity
Watch Out! Hang Out! Fuck Off!
Beyond! Out Yonder! Upsidedown

I bleed on you so ease my pain,
Blow Me Away You!!!!
Smash Up! wash away the blood from my body
I see this halo of dust all around
But my vision is clear
I know I don't have any forces left
To go the distance

La dame des fauves
I defy you, Artemis
Shoot me between the eyes
I want to face the day of reckoning
Reunite, I want to embrace your light

Implode, explode, both at the same time
Destruction, let me disappear, fill my empty,
Go to venus ('s)

// Deliverance //

Your words are so cold to me
Indisposed, don't hear your orders
Destroy the greatness of soul
Normalize what's in your hands

Take a look from the future
Get up from your dream and see
Deliverance soon is coming
For those who know
I take a sword in my hand now
I fight & kill Thanatos
Feel the ground under your feet
The roots so deep

Every step I chose to make
was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

Can't control my arms
Emergy too strong, I feel
Hypnotize myself, Blood boils inside

For those who know, I want to be
as clear, as real, as I protect
Nothingness is all around
I hate the taste of your words

Every step I chose to make
was just a kind of torture
I changed my ways
Now positive the fear became

I hate the taste of my lost illusions
I choose to live for the only
reasons I felt on the ground
I want to try

// Space Time //

I fix my attention on this ball
spinning round inside of me, deep inside
Revolving conscious planet
on an axis around this star
By the light

And the black holes in the vault of heaven
make me wonder, wonder why
How matter can disappear
Are there doors in this wall to reach the light
from time and space

Now I see those mounts of fear
feel the weight of nonsense killing simplicity
I can touch this wind of night
that erases our light and makes us paranoiac
But my legs are now so tired
climbing all alone, all space, and all the time
So I fix my attention now
on this perfect planet revolving around this star
And the sun, it seems so close
I can touch the heat of presence and I know...
I can see this monster light
that embraces those notions : space and time

The black holes in the sky, I ask the reasons why
Light blackened? Door opened?
Swim back time, door giving entrance to
Supernova as only light
Meet the earth and all the stars
The entrance, the essence, supply us

// On The B.O.T.A. //

Lost, a lion came and said:
"Come, on the brink of the abyss"
Watch my feet
swinging in the great empty one
Babel d'escaliers et d'arcades
c'etait un palais infini
No one else is able now to play
with the answers
And I open, my mind is so clear
There's a door in the wall of time...

// Rise //

History erased my story, my ancestors
but I'm still alive
Clenched fist, I bite the floor
My eyes turn to red
I raise my voice, show my fury
Wide open to the sun
I put my hands in this source of light
In that constant energy

Present at my funeral
I know I'll rise
And meet myself reborn

Sculpt entrance out of rock
Now advance without a respite
Go back to the source
I raise my head

// Fire Is Everything //

As I fight, trying to escape
Covering my soul
Watching the flames
I must understand this wizard
Fire is everything
It burns, I provoke, It's beyond
I feel, I create light

Hypnotizing power I can't resist
Reach out my hands, I feel the light
Increase flames, the heat is oppressive
Disturbs my brain, I want to dive in...

Enter now so deep the flames,
I respect the silence
Overcome with cold I pray
I see all the trees, the sky
the grass, the oceans
I embrace the world below
And I know now all the reasons
and all the countries
Fire begins and fire ends

Oh it burns, fire is all...

// Love //

Last night, alone, I met the moon
I saw its halo and the love around
"Now take the path, don't ever lose your time
Just watch the light you have inside"

I watched inside and my eyes burned
The moon was right
Roots so deep, head so high
I want to be in and watch it out

I know the reasons why I failed
The stars illuminate my being
Behold thy servant, you the force around
that makes the planets be

// In The Forest //

I want to live in the forest
Between the roots and the branches I lay
On the moss I sit, I want to rest by the river

I want to live in the forest forever
The power of trees, I want to feel forever
Connection with life, animals, and stars

Between the roots and the branches I lay
Meditate the light wide open to the stars
Speak of the whales, deep in the oceans
Speak to the planets, deep universe
