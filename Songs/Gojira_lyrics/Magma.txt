// The Shooting Star //

On the first light of the day you march on
Departure has arrived, don't look back
Avoid the darkness, stay away, stay out of sight
Until you feel the blast of a shooting star

Following the spark like a rocket in the sky
Between the bear and the scorpion, getting close
Headed north, frozen land, where tigers go to die
Don't fear the cold, it'll numb your memories out

You are higher in the sky

Learn the skill to stay alive, survival
The city is so mean, you're being watched
Reach the tunnel, light the torch, you're on the hunt
Until the light calls you back into the wild

When you get to the other side please send a sign
It'll fly through the atmosphere in time
And if you hold the truth within your hands
You won't be sent back, through the rain, reborn

Everlasting love is ever-growing
Hang on to what you have and let it grow
Everlasting love is ever-dying
It's in the past, you have to let it go

// Silvera //

Quit moaning about fate and change
Stand up on your feet and rise
With every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
Start now, open your eyes

Dead bodies falling from the sky
We are the ape with the vision of the killing
A rain of shame that fills the mines
No other blood in me but mine

Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
Youâre receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself, you change the world

Your heart is pounding in the brain
As they drag you naked in the mud
A devilâs dancing in the rain
How could you fall so low?

No! we will never let go!
Let us watch them die!

Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
Youâre receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself, you change the world

// The Cell //

All this evil, sanctified
You're not alone, you're not the only one
Overcrowded in your brain
You'll find a way out or you will fall

Get me out of here
I've been lost in the dark
Get me out of here
I'm locked inside me

No control over anything
I'm dying to learn, I'm dying to forget
Overcrowded in my mind
I have to let it go now

Get me out of here
I've been lost in the dark
Get me out of here
Now

Overcrowded in our minds
We'll find a way out, right now

// Stranded //

A growing sickness in the heart
Defective, lack of control
The cure is somewhere in the silence
But I'm crushed by the noise inside

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another part of me falls for you

Another day in the dark
No, no
Stranded in the night, stranded in the cold

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another point of view gone to waste
Please hear me out!
You kill me, face down, dead
Another day in the dark

Don't lock the door on me
You'd kill me, face down, dead
Another point of view gone to waste
Please hear me out!
You kill me, face down, dead
Another day in the dark

Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone
Leave the moment alone

// Magma //

Analyze this chemistry
Producing poison
And creeping in your veins
For the love of blood

The poison slowly spreads
Through the body and the mind
Close your eyes and drop your things
Be ready to fly

You are now, high
In the sun, burn
You're away, alive
On the moon, round

After walking all the miles
Consumed into your bones
And breathing all the dust
Of the desert land

I know that all along
You were doing it for absolution
It's written in your eyes

You are now, high
In the sun, burn
You're away, alive
On the moon, round

Away
Just want to fly away, always higher
Away
Embrace the light on the other side

// Pray //

We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day
We rise, pray for the wind to blow
We know, we know the way

No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive

We pray, pray for the light to reign
We call, we call the day

No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive
No faith in your world
Create my own to thrive

// Only Pain //

Since day one you try your best
To get what you need the most
The solution is you, becoming a god

Only pain, all in vain

The day you get to the point
All illusions are lost
The problem is you, becoming so cold

Just wanted to be good
Just wanted to be gold
Just wanted to be god
Just wanted to be

Only pain, all in vain

Take all, fear none
Wake up, go strong

I'm the lamb who was slain
It's just another offering
I reclaim the might and power
Cast away long before dawn
In a cage left to rot
Creature fierce, tamed, is dying
Lost the feel for all I've loved
It's too strong, I'm going down

// Low Lands //

Tell me what you see
In the after life
Par-delÃ  le ciel
Par-delÃ  le soleil

In all there is to learn
The sun is on our side
And though you're on the run
You will survive

Expanded to the state of light
The deepest corners of the world
Gliding through the lowlands
And swimming all the oceans

Walking through the silence
Already made it through the night
There will be a new day
Whenever the sun rises

You're invisible
You're in everything
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you see
When you're everywhere
When you're everywhere
Tell me now
Tell me now

While you drift away from all the plagues of this world
You're put out of misery
Giant monster
You won't have to face it again
Every step of the way gets you higher

All the voices trapped underneath the ground
Let them all go in the sky
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky

All the voices trapped in my head
Let them all scream in the night
Find the power lost underneath the ground
Let it all blow in the sky
