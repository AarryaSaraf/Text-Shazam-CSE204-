// Sitting And Watching //

Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright

Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no

Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes your life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, oh no

Whoa yeah
Got to be good to yourself, yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah, ah yeah

Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, whoa

Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes one's life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no, oh no
