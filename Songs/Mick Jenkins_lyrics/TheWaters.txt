// Shipwrecked //

[TheMIND:]
When it's the end of our fair lady
A million pieces lost at sea
Marooned is the crew
That's setting sail with me
Oh Lord we're sinking, God knows we fall
Set sail for Heaven, pray my soul won't get lost
Pray God accepts me, I know I'm wrong
But we've been shipwrecked, since we were gone

It was 91st first and Langley, we was 6 Deep
Steppin' up the stairs black Buick with a slick creep
Moving down the block we had froze (froze)
Felt the tension in my toes "Man who is that? I don't know"
Driving slow, many probably throw
See we was thrown off, it was New Years Eve
I still remember when my baby lungs blew them trees
I still felt like a saint when I drew that breeze
On the corners was I hangin' never bangin'
But I knew them G's, it's been tragic
Since Boy Meets World been savaged
But the goal was never really the beef, it's been cabbage
We kill for it, when we die we can't have it
But we can't kill the habit holdin' onto this boat 'til we shipwreck

[TheMIND:]
[?] shore, I die same before the dawn
I watch my niggas die of [?]
They say the waves will wash our sin
That we were black because our skin
I know we gazed upon the promise, promise land

I've been in these Waters like the Titanic
Waves crashed down, you would've thought a nigga drowned
But I'm staring at the sky like "Why panic?"
Don't you know who I pray to? We've been lookin' like prey
I just caught this shit at the prelude, peace, I been keepin' it
Step into the wools, forever a black sheep to the herd
How you not heard about this nigga?
You think you feelin' the flow somewhere in the ceiling, I'm not hot
Trust I'll be bringin' it, a nigga get it like "Pop pop!"
I've been trying to give them what's good
But don't call it food for thought
Shit taste like a hot fry
Shit had a nigga so thirsty
I couldn't see straight it was like I was cock-eyed
Fam, tell them what you've seen on the southside
Tell them, tell them where you been, nigga
Tell them where you're going
Cold park whenever I was outside
Somebody shootin' nigga
Even when it's snowing, in the cold
You could see the people thirsty
Well, I gotta little water right here
You heard me, all you gotta do is take a sip
And I don't want your souls, and I don't want your gold
I just do it for the Free my nigga don't trip
Don't trip, I do it for the Free, my nigga don't trip
Don't trip, I do it for the Free, my nigga don't trip
Don't trip

[Sample:]
Ten thousand tiny soldiers marching right through my heart
Couldn't keep me at bay

// THC //

Drink more water

I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
And you ain't even gotta cop blunts
Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
Bring it back like I'm gon' get you high
I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gem, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
THC, THC

Water is the most important natural component we have today
It makes up our world, our bodies
It has the ability to destroy, and create
It is the healing component, THC

I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gems, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high
And you ain't even gotta cop blunts
Nigga brought food for thought, so you ain't even gotta cop lunch
Bring it back like I'm gon' get you high
I'm gon' get you high
And honeys down the road, I'm crazy, I'm gon' get you high
Flawless gem, I'm no fugazi, I'm gon' get you high

// The Waters //

When the rain don't fall so hard no more
And the bank won't take my card no more
But they ain't gon pull my card neither
And they ain't gon pull my squads either
Niggas spit shit, I hock ether
Stephen Hawking, no need for talking
Got a hawk's eye but I can hardly see you
Talk's fly, pray you're not Aaliyah
I ain't trynna rock the boat but the flow crazy
I paint pictures but they're not baroque
More Scorsese, niggas made scores out of instrumentals
Nigga type a script with a pen and pencil
Use word subscripts now, so spelling bee
Fuck is you telling me that didn't sound better
Spitting it simple, fuck with me famo
Ginger ale for your hoes
Not shit else, not even my dick
Man I got way too much on my mind
Got a little light bout as bright as my Bic
And y'all got way too much on the shine
Y'all niggas don't tell enough of the truth in the booth
And it's proof you ain't fucking with mine, sip

Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God

Started from the bottom of the map
Roll Tide at the end of the wave
In this bitch ballpoint strapped, get back
This nigga got a pen to the page
Permanent marks, I'm a marksman, I never miss
Talk shit, that's a hint at your age
Big chain, that's a hint that it cage
They sayin' you sane, but I'm gone in sixty seconds on a verse, that's Mickalas Cage
Fuck with a black young man
I'm everything that it denotes
Shit comes straight from the heart, not a record exec in the back with a remote
Niggas gon' play their parts, save face on a face on the back of a C-note
Everybody wanna be the back of a D-Rose
But I can't go, Van Gogh How I handle
Paintbrush when I paint flows
Niggas in the club throwing pesos
Niggas on the block throwin pitch forks
And not from Barbados
I don't give a fuck how you rep your flag
Catch him in the cup when he roll his truth
And I don't give a fuck how you stuff your bags
Touch the sky, it's much more than trees
What can you tell me about your roots?
Spitting that truth like a cold white rapper, niggas gon' always need some Proof
Niggas gon' always need some water
Niggas gon' always speak the truth
Niggas don't always want the messenger dead and they always need the proof
My God...

Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Niggas gon' always need some water, niggas gon' always speak the truth
Niggas don't always want the messenger dead and they always want the proof
Niggas don't always need the proof
Niggas gon' always need the proof

Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Water more important than the gold
People for the gold
Everybody do it for the gold
People save your souls
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God for the waters, waters
Thank God

// Healer //

[Mick Jenkins:]
My piss ain't never been so clear
My pockets never been so empty
My heart ain't never been this full
But my stomach is not so my nigga don't tempt me
I'm hungry, I'm thirsty, I'm tired, I'm smoking it off
It seems like everyone is only lost in dreams
And I'm getting lost in the thought of myself tryna wake niggas up like a coffee bean
She called my vices
We was at Starbucks gettin' lost in these carmel apple spices
Conversation all but prices, topics ranged from the innermost thoughts to all the trifling shit on Worldstar
Another soulless systems, and other planets of people, and how close our worlds are
And how she don't ever really smoke but how nice my pearls are

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul

[Mick Jenkins:]
Cause life got a nigga stressed out
It ain't all just about rap no more
My name just like my phone and it buzz so much I don't even text back no more
I done sold so many clothes I don't even gotta pack no more
Just throw it all in one bag, break it down and roll it all in one joint
Take a puff and blow it all in one drag
We gone with the wind
Out in Montreal somewhere where your French don't gotta be excused
French inhales with some friends with my quality of life on the fringe I just see it as a muse
Everybody hurts, I just deal with the abuse
Passion of Christ with my pen to the pad
Your passion for life will exceed the paper just a sip of the holiest water he has

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul

[Jean Deaux:]
Call him Confucius
Piercin' inside my mind
Truth is within his eyes never told me a lie
But hold me up to the sky
And ring me out till I'm dry
Never felt so alive
Call you when I might dive
Out the window floor 35
Tell me you not surprised
Can you sell your peace of mind
You my shooter, you my fuckin' savior
Let me rejuvenate ya
Open your mouth and let me fall into your solar plexus
Don't be so disconnected
I want to wash over your soul until you get the message
I wanna follow you straight home so you can finish stressin'
When you need fixin', give me 30 seconds
I'll cleanse you out until you all Qu'ran
Just give me bliss and if we kiss don't get too arrogant
Cause I've been missin', busy trippin' on how much it cost
And I am gifted with my hands, that's why I never lost
Cause when I stumble into you I knew that it was God
I know that

[Jean Deaux:]
I feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
You soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
To soothe my aching soul can feel like water baby
Heal my body baby
To soothe It's so my aching soul

// Comfortable //

Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable
[x2]

Got your joint, it's in rotation, check the sinkhole patient
Deep off in these waters never needing no flotation
Devices, on this humble pie by the slices
Give it to 'em free cause it's priceless
This your invitation, I'm a even welcome imitations
Smokin' mirrors, I've been spittin' rocks and ventilation
So, breathe motherfucka just breathe
There's more than one trick up my sleeve
Tick tocks can't hang, I ain't never even gang bang
Nigga just hang with the wrong folks
Got a little older, got a little wiser, put the reggie down that's the wrong smoke
Been around the world enough to know that you will never get rich if you the wrong broke
Can't live life through a song quote, man
I've been tryin' to show y'all me
I ain't been acceptin' nobody's gas and still got drive, nigga still on E
Nigga still gon' lie, and I still on G, tell your girlfriend not to feel on me
Or, maybe you should come and get your ho bro
And usually we would have a whole bunch of ginger ale but lately I'm been in these waters like a slow bro
So, pardon my manners
This is more street etiquette
Know that I ain't goin' nowhere, if you believe otherwise then you niggas better peep rhetoric
I said

Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable
[x2]

[NoName Gypsy:]
You ain't even gotta ask me, I'm classy
Pina colada with a blue Laffy Taffy
I'm wrappin' a [?] like get that Apache
Indian remy on a scalp comin' out
Nigga just chillin' on the couch in a blouse like Dave Chappelle be that nigga for life
I drip drip on the haters forreal
Maybe write a rap book for the later appeal
Cause I still write poems on a little black thought more smoke
And mirrors inside of the matchbox more fancy
Images lookin' like mascots
My whole team got the city on the rise
And makin' the sun jealous, we dreamin' new dimensions
And movin' like black rebels with [?], cold
We don't need no ice
I just wanna see your hands in the air and the fans in the stands and my name hella bright
"Noname on the comeup"
Telefone never comin' out, what's the hold up?
Where you been at? Where the print at?
We just wanna hear the truth and the music
Black honesty and honestly I'm a be
In the cut with a book readin' prophecy
Before the sun goes down and the meaning of life becomes obsolete

Calm down, nigga, this golden
Go and take a hit of these roses
Go and get a sip of this water
Let your seat back, relax, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable, get comfortable
[x2]

We been in here, we ain't goin' nowhere
And we do it for the Free, you know that
Just vibe, just vibe, just vibe
[x2]

// Vibe //

Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this

Pendleton sweaters for the letters on some cool shit
All the writtens rapped in Woolrich, it's too cold
Let them niggas sneeze if they sick
Just don't ever bless the bullshit we too old
Paper twister I been organic no breaking Swishers
Just breaking habits, I pray for balance, I'm tasting scriptures
And hella vapors I'm painting pictures so pristine
Right on your ceiling the feeling is kinda Sistine
For the artform and never the hand clap
When that's clear you can call it Saran Wrap
Remember when you gettin' all this green
That there's gotta be sand traps
Derails don't only happen at Amtrak
If you don't understand that, well then my nigga, you special
Like cleft lips
How I stay on the upper up with the verbiage that I let go
This was never a game, and these was never no jokes
I'm impervious to your heckle
I'm Mr.Hyde Park worse than a Dr.Jekyll, ooh bad
Damn son you lookin' like Bill O'Reilly, you mad?
Our Bill of Rights from the past will never make it to the future
Even with a Martin Luther, fifty shades of Kama Sutra
We're fucked, so would you smoke with me?
I know this shit has been stressful, but would you cope with me?
I'm knee deep in these waters I'm asking you would you float
If you knew that I could build a boat
And I told you that God spoke with me

Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this

Feel the vibe I got some Gil Scott I know you like to snap to/too
Talk a couple black thoughts, spit 'em through this gap tooth
Just for the sheer thought that you listening let me express my gratitude
How can you hate on an attitude?
Know that's it's me my nigga he's too thorough
Been sowing seeds out in New York, niggas good in like two burrows
I been in the 514, french gettin to clean customs is routine eatin' hella poutine
I think I might buy one more
Connected with mines on the cusp of greatness if you didn't know
Now you know come and fuck with the free nigga
Fuck your lateness, this whole world is too fucking heinous
I seen some shit on the t.v that had fucked my day up
This life will fucking drain us, they tryna fucking train us
Niggas busy trappin', Didn't even get to see my granny before she passed cause I was too busy rapping
That type of shit will shift your whole perspective
Make you spit the type of shit to rip a whole collective
The pieces I been connecting the truth
I hope I connect with the thesis
But feel the vibe, I got some Sade I know that we can snap to
Knxwledge got some rap tapes I know that we can rap to
I'm a roll this joint and prolly light it
You can hit it if you want, but know that you don't really have to
I'm at you, and open with my intentions, I'll never be condescending
We'll do all the things I mentioned

Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk about some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Just vibe with a nigga, one time with this joint
Get high with a nigga one time, I won't have you on yo' ass
We can talk bout some real shit, tell me how you feel
Tell me do you feel this, feel this
Tell me do you feel this
Tell Me do you yo feel this, feel this

// Jazz //

Drink more water... or you might die

Seven Nine, King Drive, you can picture me rollin'
Bendin' corners we was headed to the Rasta
Nigga been blessed but a nigga been sick
And a nigga been stressed so, fuck it I'm a doctor
Self medicated, ginger ale in the champagne flutes
And I ain't celebratin', shookin' up crack
Where presentation's everything, tell 'em wait 'til I'm plated
Patience, I'm faded, like outdated denim
Hearin' it like this about as rare as a cadence
The boy got some Miles Davis in him
Talkin' all that jazz

Tellin' all that truth, nigga talk your shit
Better watch your mouth, better watch your back
Better choose the right way on some fork in the road shit

And of course the path less traveled
Fuck I look like followin' your footsteps?
Don't fumble cause this ain't Sunday football
I ain't at home with a footrest
In fact I'm in front of the back of your head
But I'm comin' from behind, better look left
Look left like where the fuck is he?
You got time on your head boy
You got time on your head like you wearing buck fifty
Do it so clean but it's still so filthy, fuck with me
Cause you already know you fuck niggas really can't really talk with me

Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz
Telling all that truth, nigga talk your shit
Nigga talk your shit
[x3]

Talking all that jazz might get you popped
But I ain't gonna stop don't A-S-K
Until I'm in a white drop top with a smile on my face
And a hand in the air like JFK

Wait, all in your steam better known as a hotbox
Crack rocks in a square, better known as block
Impaired tryna move that's hopscotch
Unfair one leg is a hell of a cock block
My nigga what an anomaly
My nigga look at the world, my nigga what a monopoly
Drop tops in the hood, and they sitting on 22's
Nigga still on section 8 though
Tricking on the low for a ho nigga
Momma at the crib tryna stretch a couple pesos
Couldn't paint a pretty picture with the tears and her makeup
Better get MAACO, makeovers help niggas make money
But I'm a always talk that James Moody
Most rappers these days is actors
And I can't keep watching the same movie
These niggas keep sharing the same models
And these models act like they ain't groupies
I ain't stupid, talking Duke Ellington, Count Bassie, Monk and Dave Brubeck
I ain't stupid, talking too eloquent, I ain't stutter, my nigga I ain't Ruben
Ginger ale for the hoes in champagne flutes
Tell one of them come pour me a glass
She don't act up, she can get this truth
Tell her ass read that while I roll this joint
Nigga tryna relax, cause the shit don't stop
I ain't tryna relapse to that whack bullshit
Niggas better evac when I drop
Cause I swear that this black man ain't talking all that jazz

Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz
Telling all that truth, nigga talk your shit
Nigga talk your shit
[x3]

Talking all that jazz might get you popped
But I ain't gonna stop don't A-S-K
Until I'm in a white drop top with a smile on my face
And a hand in the air like JFK

That Coltrane, that Charlie Parker, that Charles Mingus
That Frank Sinatra
Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz
That Coltrane, that Charlie Parker, that Charles Mingus
That Frank Sinatra
Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz
Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz
Talking all that jazz, talking all that jazz

// Black Sheep //

Young Mozart with more keys
Black sheep with a gang of wolves before me
They think we homies
But keep hearts and shoulders colder than Loki
I be no Thor, just bring 'em more of this halitosis
Got everybody asking is it hot in here?
I ain't no polka dot man, I ain't tryna find no spot in here
I ain't no guinea pig
Just know that he drop hot lines that all in my linage
The process is linen the wrinkles definitive
So what all the hate for?
Her premise is primitive, her promise is tentative
Better pay attention, so polish the penmanship
I been late to mention the fact that it's free
This is for all the niggas bastard as me
Food for your soul, Harold's chicken
Statik Selektah battered the beat
Assault and battery on your mind, can't see how this world be?
It won't be to long before you need a battery pack
But I'm better than that
A freshman on varsity nigga where yo Letterman at?
Ginger ale on the rocks where yo gentleman at?
Boy my pinky in the air, I just crush a lot
I ain't never been a playa
Niggas throwing shade they could holla at me later
You might catch a fade, give a fuck about a fader
And I do it for the love
Praying that my people get to see the one above show me love
And know that I'm speaking the truth
I never had no problem being transparent
Remember I was younger wishing that I had my friends parents
Back when they lied to us better, I'm on this water now
Funny how these other niggas thirsty but they watered down
They oughta drown, watching niggas run for the boat when the rain drops
How many lies can you tell yourself before the pain stops
Out here harvesting the same crop, woe is me
I'm out here Sewing seeds, blowing trees, writing all this poetry
Every freaking night peep the Jodeci
'Till the people quoting me, or at least peep the potency
And profess a nigga artistry openly
Black sheep but I know you see the GOAT in me

[Clark:]
What do you think can be done to change, to use your term, the moral fiber of America?
[Baldwin:]
I think that one has got to find some way of putting the present administration of this country on the spot.
One has got to force, somehow, from Washington, a moral commitment, not to the Negro people, but to the life of this country.
It doesn't matter any longer, and I'm speaking for myself, for Jimmy Baldwin, and I think I'm speaking for a great many other Negroes too.
It doesn't matter any longer what you do to me; you can put me in jail, you can kill me.
By the time I was 17, you'd done everything that you could do to me.
The problem now is: how are you going to save yourselves?

// Drink More Water //

[Mick Jenkins & Ebony:]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Mick Jenkins:]
Will these niggas let me sip my ginger ale? You can tell that I'm parched
On point like a dart or a pen with the ball, don't start, I can tell that you aren't
What you want, the gold and the hoes and the lights?
The cars and the clothes what a life
Do your stars get chose and your bars get low when you're dull as a fucking butter knife
Can't cut shit, can't touch this, it's a masterpiece
When the pen attack the leaf
But it's all in a stroke on some paintbrush shit, they've been shooting in the streets and I ain't ducked yet
We still here, 79th and Phillips, hope you brought a Philips cause niggas like to drill here
Won't cut it with a flathead, put it in your back if you lack with yo' sack or yo' flat red
Irritate the white skin, like a black-head, I just pray to God you don't flatline
I just play the background, Spacetime on the board, you can check a nigga stat line
Smoke tree now, spit it with a black lip, had to take a little break like halftime
Felines want the green like catnip, I just want my shit bumping in your alpine

[Mick Jenkins & Ebony:]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Mick Jenkins & Ebony:]
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Mick Jenkins:]
I couldn't afford to get my girl into this open mic that I performed for
But somewhere in the world there's a Riff Raff concert that people gon' swarm for
I never understand that shit
Put all the whack rappers in the band and disband that shit
Have everyone panicking
Like when Danica Patrick got good with the handling
Dismantling the plans of the industry management (ooh)
Think I might've said too much
Ain't we s'posed to still be slaves?
Nigga might've read too much
Saw the rape taking place in my face in the hood
On some Drake shit, a nigga might've cared too much, so I guess I'm in my feelings
Been so fucking focused on the flow that I didn't even notice that I ain't got no ceiling
Peeling back the truth of the matter like damn, why these niggas lie so much?
Healing rap, the truth to the matter is, I'm so ahead that I ain't never had to try to front
Don't try your luck, don't taint the green, nice with the paper never had to buy a blunt
Exceed expectations like a pop fly when you tried to bunt
Field goal when you tried to punt
We kick it that hard, nigga
No limits to my masterpiece, I'm Master P with a motherfucking black card, nigga
And I ain't never had to act hard, nigga
And I ain't never had to act hard

[Mick Jenkins & Ebony:]
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, water, take a little sip
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

[Mick Jenkins & Ebony:]
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water, take a little sip, nigga
Drink more water
Just a sip will make a nigga feel like gold

// Canada Dry //

Ridin' around off this ginger ale
Peep the herbal essence in the papers, vapors
On fire if you couldn't tell, but trust me
I ain't checkin' for no Jezebelles or Delilahs
Lot of niggas screamin' that they real
Perception is a motherfuckin' pill, you a liar
I been rockin' boats since Aliyah
Tryin' to take it higher with these notes like Mariah
Fuck with me, your connect ain't got it for the Free
Start the elevation, I can't keep it lowkey
OG, finna' wake these niggas up, ain't been gettin' no sleep
Tryin' to bring him more sheep, I'm like little Bo Peep
What you in it for?
Cause they out here coppin' souls with they info
Are you the hitta' or the lick, what's the difference though?
Yeah I heard you got a plan, what's the mission though?
Cause this game is so foul (too foul)
Got a young man tryin' to move through the city like a black Tom Thibodeau
Like Stallone, you can fight it all you want
But we still gonna be expendable, these niggas don't listen, no
I was always told that you never really know what you got 'til it's gone
Cancer caught my granny 'fore I got a chance to check up what the fuck was I on? (the fuck was I on?)
I was playing checkers this is chess
Never put your faith into a check
Got to play the hand that you was dealt
There's only four aces in a deck, motherfucker, I've been

Ridin' around off this ginger ale
Momma wouldn't like the way I smell right now
Realest nigga out can't you tell
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
Ridin' around off this ginger ale
Prayin' everyday that I don't fail right now
Killin' niggas, how can't you tell
Drink this water, tell me how you feel right now
[x2]

// Who Else //

[Chorus:]
Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't felt it like this in a long time
Take yo shoes off at the door
And the flow stay clean for a long time, long time
Southside nigga from the go
So many times in the wrong place at the wrong time
Double cup the water sip slow
Double cup the water sip slow

Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't heard it like this in a long time
Take yo shoes off at the door
And the flow stay clean for a long time, long time
Southside nigga from the go
So many times in the wrong place at the wrong time
Double cup the water sip slow
Double cup the water sip slow

Tell me who else do you know
Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't heard it like this
Know that you ain't heard it like this
Know that you ain't heard it like this

I ain't Never been a loner
Although I feel like Jonah in the ocean
Conversations with the big fish
Danny ocean what a gamble they could miss this I pray that you don't
An olive branch symbolized that the water had stopped
Like if you got trees and truths before the waters had dropped
I know you saw signs
Black Mel Gibson with the passion
I been gifted with the rapping
Niggas tripping I been trapping
Gotta move so many keys to unlock the boxes we trapped in
Somebody tell the captain
We been ready to take off for like 400 years now
We're blinded through our ears now
Plus it's all smoke n mirrors now
In conversation I Piers Morgan my peers now just to keep it authentic
And often it's a shadow of Paul Pierce how well we uh play for the green
All the while Never noticing the changing of scene
Like I was gone leave this bitch but if y'all gone roll up I might as well stay for the green
And I can't go
That's a dark tale
So much weeping you'll be giving birth to willows in this shark tale
So much weighing on his mind every bar like a barbel
Every crack in his voice got coke from the cartel
I ain't tellin jokes this is heart felt
Tell me who else do you know
Know that you ain't heard it like this in a long time
Take yo shoes off at the door don't disrespect flow stay clean for a long time long time
Southside nigga from the go
So many times in the wrong place at the wrong time
Double cup the water sip slow
Double cup the water sip slow
Sip on this country time fam I been squeezing my lemons
Squigi my windows I'm tryna see it clearly
Spit it in brail so I know you feel me the shit is bumpin
Like cucumbers
I brought the reign for a new thunder
Now

[Chorus]

// Dehydration //

Sip!
I've been drinkin' all this water
Piss ain't never been so clear, I'll be a martyr
Right in front yo' face make no mistake
I rolled the trees and took the truth right to the face
This ginger ale is for your daughter
Or your shorty or whatever
A shortage of clever, we comin' up shorter than ever (tell 'em)
Electrical shortage, it's all in your circuit
I'm workin' like scissors and not less you sparkin' it better
We sparked the discussion
Spark 'to yo' light bulb, just call me Confucius, we causin' concussions
They callin' me conscious, a Jimminy Cricket
Unfortunate events, got me writin' it like Lemony Snicket
Perils of wisdom all in the pictures
Depicted y'all niggas know how I roll it
Know that I'm focused, know that I know what I'm holdin' is golden
(Hurt Everybody)
Southside nigga, seen a whole lot of shit
Six point stars and a whole lotta dope
With a shooter that don't miss, that's a whole lotta bricks
The city that raised me, the people that taught me
The difference is crazy
It's all love though, know that I'm a share my light when your vision gets hazy

[TheMIND:]
Speak your mind or make your mark and I'm a spark and I'll be dead, they'll be blessed if I die (And I know you know)
I keep a pistol and the Bible if they try me ain't no killer but guarantee they'll get got (I know you know)
I know that I'm wrong, but the Chi is all I've known (I know you know)
You could break my bones, you could tweak my [?], it will always be my home

I was on the back porch gettin' faded, cup of ginger ale and them peanut butter loafers
[?] like that so contagious, swear I told myself that I'd never be a smoker
Fail, watch me inhale
Hot box had a dumb nigga in jail
Cops start young niggas piled in the whip
Kings of the street, they was crownin' the Vic
Bail was like five hundred, [?] my lil homie down, everyday I pay her back
Second degrees and negligent seas and apologies can't bring a dog back, facts
We off that slim, got a little fifth of Jack
We off that feelin' like Daniel
Pray for the niggas that's lyin', they don't wanna see me dismantle
Put it on wax like a candle
Send it to the blogs, I can see the fear
Put it in yo' prayers, send it to yo' God
Niggas so flawed with the fraud if you act then the gat will applaud
Got a passion like Patrick I come off the block
Grindin' 'til holes in my shoes like I'm runnin' in Crocs
Don't slip I don't run in my socks
Time is money, I'm all out of clock, nigga wake up
Wake up my nigga you sleepin'
I know that you thirsty, you ain't drinkin' water, my nigga you tweakin'
And I'm a be right here in my spot
A little more free than I already got
Trippin' off you cause you had your shot
Nigga wake up

[TheMIND:]
Speak your mind or make your mark and I'm a spark and I'll be dead, they'll be blessed if I die (And I know you know)
I keep a pistol and the Bible if they try me ain't no killer but guarantee they'll get got (I know you know)
I know that I'm wrong, but the Chi is all I've known (I know you know)
You could break my bones, you could tweak my [?], it will always be my home

// 514 //

I ain't talkin' Yves Saint Laurent
But I'm been on Saint Laurent like a motherfucka
Overworked, overlooked, hella red
Tell 'em that I'm Type O for the bloodsuckas
Leeches, I'm 6'5" quit reachin'
Nigga's only goals is the goal
Tell them Creflo Dollar motherfuckas quit preachin'
I've been in the 514, my French gettin' too clean
Customs is routine, eatin' hella poutine, I think I'm a buy one more
Nigga I've been goin' through it as of late
Lot of people talk what they think that they would have did
Like the CTA I keep my patience, I ain't in it for the JP Morgan chase
I'm a nice guy, nigga do this look like last place
I'm on Priceline, searchin' for a flight to Montreal
Me and Jerry on Saint Laurent
I just want a little freedom, don't we all, don't we all
Just, get a little tired of the bullshit they feed us?
Serve and protect, like protect your pockets and servin' subpoenas
Whole shit a circus and they ain't even servin' us peanuts
I learned this, back when they was servin' us free lunch
System 'bout as foul as a free throw
Tell me what the fuck a nigga know about a free throw
If everything that he thought stem from a remote
This is so that he know

I ain't talkin' Yves Saint Laurent
But I'm been on Saint Laurent like a motherfucka
I've been in the 514, my French gettin' too clean
Customs is routine, eatin' hella poutine, I think I'm a buy one more
I've been in the 514, my French gettin' too clean
Customs is routine, eatin' hella poutine, I think I'm a buy one more
I ain't talkin' Yves Saint Laurent
But I'm been on Saint Laurent like a motherfucka
On Saint Laurent like a motherfucka, I've been in the 514

Peep the passion, the thought he put in is hardly comparable
Speakin' of parabels, these days I find myself feelin' like Charles Barkley, man all you niggas is terrible
So I just tell 'em, Southside in this motherfucka, got the presence of a housefly
Everybody know I'm in this motherfucka, you can hear it when you listen
And I do it for the fan, Peter Griffin, we got no Meg
Ride good, nigga no pegs
Free Nation rebels, you need more lead, homie get your weight up
You know who I pray to when I wake up, no weapon formed, you don't get spared cause you less informed
I'm on my square cause we in a box, burners be like cinder blocks
Box sampled finna chop, door push it in the cold
You could feel it when a nigga spoke
Cause a nigga broke free and all the feelings of the fickled folk fuck with me
Pour a little passion and put it in your hope
Grow a little jasmine and put it in your smoke
Blow a little ash, it'll take a bigger toke
Bumpin' Little Dragon, I take a drag thinkin' damn
Hope you see the symbols crashin' and a nigga note
Hope you see the symbols, hope you Stacy Dash
Hope you think quick fast when the trigger stroke
Hope you think quick fast, catch my ass in the 514

My French gettin' too clean
Customs is routine, eatin' hella poutine, I think I'm a buy one more
I mean I ain't talkin' Yves Saint Laurent
But I'm been on Saint Laurent like a motherfucka
Overworked, overlooked, hella red
Tell 'em that I'm Type O for the bloodsuckas
Leeches, I'm 6'5" quit reachin'
Nigga's only goals is the goal
Tell 'em [?] low dollar, motherfuckas quit preachin'

I've been in the 514 (my French gettin' too clean)
I've been in the 514 (my French gettin' too clean)
Shoutout to the 514
Shoutout to the 514 (6'5" quit reachin')

// Martyrs //

Shorty told me that she do not do the fakes
Same bitch got weave
My nigga mow the lawn it's too many snakes
That's the same shit that got Eve
What you ain't never seen a nigga on a
Horse?
You ain't seen chief keef new Porsche?
Naw you ain't seen shit yet
Betta not forget that spit it like I chain smoke Newports
All the little niggas got guns now
And they carry them to the fucking beat
All these little girls give it up now shame I could see the cherry stems in the fucking street
Niggas aim too high to leave the lows
Niggas hang too high to see the lows
Niggas ain't
Niggas ain't really listening let me break it down for you
Just before you forgot about him
Overlooked Or started doubting
I douse it with the flow and started talking all this water shit it's like I started drowning
In truth
The thought is pounding
I started counting the loopholes in they stories that they tell us
Every evening at like 10 when Judy suu is on yo tv
Tellin Songs in the key of life, you was on yo Stevie
I pray it's never to preachy but I'm preaching
Losing hella blood these fuck niggas leechin
Why you reachin I'm like 6'5
Stop it
We are not on the same a plateau
Chateau de Chenonceau
You just throwing shade in my shadow
Ginger ale in my Chalice I never been champagne shallow
I'd never run from a battle I'd rather hang from the gallows
For I let a stray bullet catch a nigga on the nine!
Trey 8 pullin 0-9 kwame brown if a nigga act foul then we put em on the line
It's a shame that's the game on these young niggas minds like

I'm a get all this money
I'm a buy all this shit
I'm a fuck so many hoes
Nigga I'm a fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas
I'm a get all this money
I'm a buy all this shit
I'm a fuck so many hoes
Nigga I'm a fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas hanging
Hanging
I'm just with my niggas hanging
Hanging

Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the money
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit sound funny
Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the gold
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit feel cold?

I'm a get all this money
I'm a buy all this shit
I'm a fuck so many hoes
Nigga I'm a fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas
I'm a get all this money
I'm a buy all this shit
I'm a fuck so many hoes
Nigga I'm a fuck yo bitch
I'm just with my niggas hanging
Hanging
I'm just with my niggas hanging
Hanging

// Jerome //

Get on your feet and testify
Lift your voice up to the sky

[Kirk Knight:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the, get the
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the

Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
Or you gon' need a halo, I'm a mothafuckin' slayer
This ain't no game, I'm not no player
Nigga tryna find his way and then he bringing pain
You better know we major

I'm on this water heavy, what's a little gold and a pager
Wrestle with these words a young Mick Foley
All I see is AC Slater
These niggas jaded, 'bout to set it off, I be like Jada
Still on the block it feel like Jenga how it tumble down
Hands shaking like a Rumble, pack up we humble now
Buzzing how we bumble now
Leaving niggas puzzled, do the right thing and they buggin' out
Know the free don't stop for nothing, tell 'em niggas stop the frontin'
Roll in front, so if you ever see teardrop you better know we choppin' onions
I'm spitting yellow bricks, we rarely stop for munchkins
That's why I do not fuck with customs, I'm unaccustomed to these costumes
Know that if you cross the free it just might cost you
I'm not a doctor or Kevin Costner
The way I'm dancing with these wolves, I pray I never lost her
Step, I keep it steppin' nigga that's a bet

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Relax and take notes, relax and take notes, notes, notes, notes

Put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I'm just showin' love to my mothafuckin' people
You can tell your mans we ain't going no where
Now keep your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I'm just showin' love to my mothafuckin' people
You can tell your mans we ain't going no where

[Kirk Knight:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the, get the
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the
Yeah, yeah, yeah get the

Jerome in the mothafuckin' house now
Let a loafer steppin', niggas better watch they mouth now
Leaving loaded lessons, pray for blessings when the doubts 'round
Thousand Island stretchin', I ain't stressin' no salad
I'm in this water where the sharks be
Coming for the same place your thoughts be
Artsy, dirty mouth, I never do the flossing
Hardly, stuntin' on the niggas that's frontin'
I know they do not want it, I run over niggas that's punnin'
No I ain't tryna kick it, I'm cookin' no bun in the oven
I need it on the stove, push it to the people off a cottage grove
Pot of gold, flooded more than Hollygrove
Mothafuckin' Hollywood, never take a holiday
I'm spotting foes everywhere, know that I get very rare
Faced the God, what's up Based God?
I'm pacing hot, tracing opps
Know your enemy, patrol your energy
Don't slip with niggas that pretend to be
Only kin of me can call me blood
Even a friendly can see the love
We do it for the free and keep it up
Tell your niggas they can keep the hate
Tell my friends I appreciate, the value never depreciate

[Joey Bada$$:]
This for my niggas, who be chillin' with them killers in the wild
We gettin' high 'til we bug the fuck out
It's been a minute, I've been chillin' on the
Prowl right, right
And to my crooks from Chi-town all the way to Flatbush
We get wild if you give us that look
Hit you with the follow up and the right hook, right, right

[Joey Bada$$:]
Put your fucking hands up in the air
Or you gon' have to lay low when I motherfucking spray you
This ain't no game like Sega, don't be a hero
I'm with my good fellas and we 'bout to rob dinero
Give me the pesos, give me the Euros, give me the dollars
Give me the say so if these niggas want the drama
If I call my partners up, body bags is popping up
Keep popping shit, we pop the trunk, make you niggas popular
Hit him between his oculars, what the fuck is popping, cause?
Super Saiyan like I opened forty-seven chakras up
Pussy hoes we knocking up, these flows keep stocking up
As long as I'm rhyming I'm Ben Wallace on your wallets, uh
My true shottas go blocka, blocka
Soul shocking with the fire, probably light your block up
Stop your blood clot crying, the pussy boy there dying
It's a cold, cold world, I think these niggas need the iron like "blaow"

[Joey Bada$$:]
How you like me now?
It's the motherfucking Brooklyn king of them now
Niggas jocking my style, I been all on the road
I been checking out the shows, I been fucking your hoes, like blap
How you like me now?
It's the motherfucking Brooklyn king of them now
Niggas biting my style, I been all on the road
I been checking out the shows, I been fucking your hoes

[Joey Bada$$:]
This for my niggas, who be chillin' with them killers in the wild
We gettin' high 'til we bug the fuck out
It's been a minute, I've been chillin' on the
Prowl right, right
And to my crooks from Chi-town all the way to Flatbush
We get wild if you give us that look
Hit you with the follow up and the right hook, right, right
