Album: Waves

// Alchemy //

It's like turning nothing into everything
Starting with scraps and redefining what society thinks is quality
Like who thought up the golden standard the haves?
The have nots ask not what you can do for them but what have you done?
I mean you're sick and you're tired and you're hungry and you're thirsty
And you take that first bite or drink, you sip slow
Because truth is harsh but it burns, but it's also addictive
You want more till you...
Drink more water

Flooded the market, murdering flows it's blood on the carpet
A crime scene, gave 'em the light
Wait 'till I turn on the high beams
Niggas ain't seeing me
Drunk off this water you might just see 3 of me
Don't greet me as God, my nigga I ain't no deity
Take off them water wings, I'm losing water weight I been on creatine
Curing my countenance, creating this gold from the lead in my pencil
I think I'm a alchemist, and it's gon take courage no cowardly dogs
In the pound, we don't want 'em round
No love lost or found, don't give a fuck bout a clown
Bit 'em with the Pros conversation profound
I was down on my luck but I'm still myself
Drinking all this water tryna heal myself
Know I keep it real even steal homie
Just want you to feel It I don't really ever feel myself
Remember when I had to find a meal myself
Fresh out of jail, crashed at my nigga Slims
He ain't think twice bout the shit
The move was a roll of the dice
Know the lord on my side cause them 63rd nights was a bitch
Always knew that life wasn't this though
Still had to get right with the wrist wrote this though
With a little light and a pistol
Lowkey, peep how he keep the peace, you know me

They say I be talking bout water too much
You hear that?
That's how many fucks I could give
Still I got love for a hater would give up a rib
They say they confused about ginger ale
Well come have a sip when it's chill
Y'all need to chill
People tell me I'm that nigga now
I know none of that shit is real

// Slumber //

[Chorus - Mick Jenkins & Sean Deaux:]
And tell your niggas
"Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can't sleep too long,"
Way too long
Ain't no TLC, boy, we can't creep too long
Creep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
Shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
But tell em
"Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can't sleep too long"
Wake up, wake up
We got bread to break up, we can't be too long
Can't sleep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
(Get low)

[Verse 1 - Mick Jenkins:]
Brush you teeth after the wake and bake
Drink more water, watch your fake intake
Don't ever be scare to make mistakes, thats how you grow
And avoidin' the same mistakes you made is how you know
You movin' forward, its bout progressin', I'm learnin' lessons
Most of this shit is really perception, its no perspective
Most of my niggas is the exception, the water keep us reflective
Thats why I gotta repeat it, pearls of wisdom repeated
I'm chiefin' with people that I can trust, rolling, burning, 'til they depleted
Leave the ashes its dust
They sayin' cash is a must, I beg to differ
I take the little dipper, as long as the ladle full
I wanted to be an actor but I couldn't play the fool at all
Miseducated, could give a fuck about no school of thought, if you hate it
Food for thought, regurgitatin' what they played it for me
Cookin' faded, look what we created, then we catered for free

[Chorus - Mick Jenkins & Sean Deaux:]
And tell your niggas
"Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can't sleep too long,"
Way too long
Ain't no TLC, boy, we can't creep too long
Creep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
Shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
But tell em
"Wake up, wake up, wake up, we can't sleep too long"
Wake up, wake up
We got bread to break up, we can't be too long
Can't sleep too long
We finna put you on some shit though
THEMpeople make you wanna get low
(Get low)

[Verse 2 - Saba:]
Wake up, woke up to another 24
Some my brothers still in slumber, thank the lord
We was just dreamin' about makin' it easier
The little things in life, you know the tedious
Well oh he was teachin' us, he workin' while the goonies hate
Real nigga in the same thing too they straight
I can't complain I was able when they was painin
Ain't had cable but had a radio and a brain
Put two and two together in the ghetto
And thats how I came up off my hoover thought a lil not
Mick even brought the water, I swear its a fuckin' potluck
Give us this day our daily bread and thats more than a dollar bill
Had to cope with a lot of bull but ain't fold cuz I'm smart again
Look, they no longer recognize you
You once did a show iced tonic and didn't impress anybody
Now look at you, you acquire, your pussy rate has sky-rocketed
You came a long way since high school, you stepped out of your comfort zone

[Sean Deaux:]
I think I used to sleep so long, cause I ain't ever want to stop dreamin'
Count my blessings like sheep, this real life just won't let me be
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, it's time to wake up my niggas
Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, it's time to wake up, right now
I think I used to try too hard, cause now everything comes easy
Open your eyes and trust yourself, and let the world see who you are
Its all yours
Its all yours
Its all yours

// Get Up Get Down //

Tell me what ya waitin' on
Who you waitin' for?
Tell me, how much time you wastin'?
Please don't waste no more

[Hook:]
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get down, get down, get down, get down

Isn't it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
Isn't it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
Isn't it ironic, got 'em Hooked On Phonics?
Mama used to think it was just chronic, it was all bad
It was all bad, it was all bad
And all we wanted was to give you was a good time, some good vibes

[Hook:]
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get up, get out, get down
(move your body)
Get down, get down, get down, get down
(and all we wanted to give you was a good time)

Came in this bitch with intentions to black out
The audience all white, I thought we been blacks out
See thirty five show tour and I almost backed out a year ago
Back in my bag, back in the days, a young nigga trapped out the pad
Couple of ounces, no, It wasn't too bad, cup full of water, I be missin' my dad
Told my love that I would do him one better
That's on my kidneys, my piss soo much clearer
Down to the letter, you can't offend me, it's February
Man, everybody's shoulder's cold, everybody know it's gold
Driftin' in this pole position, everybody holdin' O's
Bars in yours in no time, bars in your court, know it's go time
We didn't come for Gold Line, from that southside Chicago, I got that
I can't go, ma, I'm still underground, pay attention, that's a gold mine
Old time, why you talkin' paper?, I'm still for mine, nigga

And I wake up feelin' good, lemme pray, lemme blow
Send a text, "What? Ya'll niggas on today? Lemme know"
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, nigga
And I wake up feelin' good, lemme pray, lemme blow
Send a text, "what? Ya'll niggas on the deck? Lemme know"
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up...

// Your Love //

(Do you feel it?
I know you feel that, girl.)
Had to hold it down for the love
She the type of woman make you wanna leave the drugs
(Had to hold it down!)
I'm the type of nigga that don't really do the club
Flaming water, double cup, baby let me know what's up
(Oh… we could have a dream.)

[Hook:]
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

Pardon me for standing in your sunshine, lady
Let me parlay with you for the one time, lady

I ain't tryna run game, or hit you with a sublime, lady
I want your love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want to love you
(OOhh…)
5'3" with the Crown Royal skin-tone
Plus she brought her own water
Man, she been on
Per the joints; she hit me with a couple pearls of wisdom
Now it's on, had me open like a flip-phone
Flip-mode, every single night is buzzin'
We be learnin' till we leanin' like we off the Robitussin
Keep the pace slow
Movin with the tempo, know you feel it when the bass low
Waitin' on the break down
I don't need a peso
Did it for the lo-lo girl, the free, it's what I'm based on
Come and feel with me
We could be a couple; Mase Songs
No insurance, it explodes!
Just state farm
Hold on, Lady
Stay calm

[Hook:]
We can have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago

(You know I need your love)
I'm the type of nigga that don't really do the club
Flaming water, double cup, baby let me know what's up
(Oohh)

[Hook:]

// Piano //

[Hook:]
With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin' all these bars, trappin' out the bando
Money back, money back
Patient, breakin' profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin' tithes, I need that ten-fold

I'm still on this ten-speed, touching' these tempos
Eatin' this tempeh
I feel like Dikembe, guy never been dunked on
Young nigga can't go
Chip on my shoulder, this queso is not comin' in by the case-load
We was rippin' samples by the crate-load
Pen do the paint job, never need MAACO
Even when the peso splittin' up pay so

[Hook:]
With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin' all these bars, trappin' out the bando
Money back, money back
Patient, breakin' profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin' tithes, I need that ten-fold

Relax, smoke
Chill with a nigga, don't tell the streets that I'm broke
Deal with a nigga
As long as you feeling' the vibes
Imma keep dealin' the vibes
Want you to feel it
As long as you feeling' the vibes
Imma keep dealin' the vibes
Want you to feel it
Relax, smoke
Chill with a nigga, don't tell the streets that I'm broke
Deal with a nigga
As long as you feeling' the vibes

// The Giver //

[Hook:]
Girl it's nice to meet ya
I really like yo' style
Westside mamacita
The sunshine in yo' smile
And I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me
(Hey)
Give it to me, give it to me
(Hey)
Give it to me, give it to me
(Huh)
Give it to me, give it to me

Like it was yo' last
A nigga's skin about as thick as a cast
Just in case you don't
But lemme let you know my case in point
I'm tryna build, I'm not a mason but
I'm thinkin' blueprints when I face the joint
She tastin' truth that's what I laced her blunt with
I let shorty hit like lace fronts
We evaluate the conscious of one another
Talks of sisters and brothers
Dispositions of our mothers
Saw the world in different colors
I believe that this path had been chose
Got no reason to deceive, matter fact a nigga heart is on his sleeve
Girl it bleed, I'm just lettin' you know
You don't gotta hit the weed just make sure you bring your smile
And that seed, I got water
We connect and it grow
I'm just hopin' that you pleased 
and if you not I'm prayin' that you lettin' me know
It ain't no sense in ever letting you go
It ain't no sense in ever letting you go

[Hook:]
Girl its nice to meet ya
I really like yo' style
Westside mamacita
The sunshine in yo' smile
And I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me
(Hey)
Give it to me, give it to me
(Hey)
Give it to me, give it to me
(Huh)
Give it to me, give it to me

Know somewhere that we can go
If you down then let me know
On my way right now
On my way

Know somewhere that we can go
If you down then let me know
On my way right now
On my way
On my way right now

(Oooh)
Like it was your yo last
Like you seem about to die
It was like I saw the future 
when I looked into your eyes
And I just want you to
(Oooh)
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

// 40 Below //

Love? You know, what do you know about love? What do you possibly think you know about love? You know, I'm sick and tired of men usin' love as some kind of disease you just catch. Love should've brought your ass home last night! I heard you say you sorry, you sorry and you tired. You don't love me! You only love your damn self!

How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold on me
How she got soo cold

Soo cold, soo cold
Soo cold, soo cold
Soo cold

How she got soo cold on me
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold
How she got soo cold on ya
How she got soo cold

Cause the last that I remember
Think I left you in December
But it feel like February on a nigga
(How she got soo cold)

Shawty was a beauty from the start, I was seventeen
That's when I took notice of a sculpture angelic
Though I knew it was a long way from heavenly
Can I kick it?
Skip the visitation, let her know I need the digit
Young nigga, all I really had was jokes
Just finessin', she a low key blessin', I didn't even know
Not reminiscin', just lamentin on mistakes I made
Random nights I lurked on her Facebook page
Youngin' thinkin' like "my time right, I done got my mind right"
Yeah she heard that mixtape I got a little limelight, I let her know
She didn't let up, learned a lesson when she let me go
Just let me sing and this is how it go

I could hold it down
Want to be your nigga
She said "not right now"
I said "how you figure?"
I could hold it down, down, down, down, down, down
Want to hold it down, down, down, down, down, down
I could hold it down, down, down, down, down, down, down

// P's & Q's //

Still drinkin' water on y'all niggas, man

With perfect pitch I'm singing free my niggas
Polished and purposeful he's producing pristine pictures
Pay me, gimme plenty, the trees begat keys
That's paper, so hold the pennies
I'm pressed and like pests, I'm in every nook and cranny
Your pantry, with some patience your panties
I got patience, it's prevalent in the previous plannings
I been on my P's and Q's, fuck is this? A Quiz?
Peep this nigga passion, I'm not picking him to quit
Watch him paint, and it quaint?
All that presence in his pen, he be pearlin' all that wisdom, all that pressure be to sin
A pearlescent silver lining through the questions I been quilting together
Niggas quiver in the cold, are you equipped for the weather?
When there's polar and it's piercing through your sweater to your chest
How you persevere and press on through the quest?
I been on my P's and Q's, can't you see I do not play?
And I pack it full of quotes
Pray you perceive it in the way that I intended
I ain't preaching and I'm never that pretentious
Not pretending, Quasimodo how my back is
I've been bending, I've been lifting all the pounds
Break it down, pass it around
Politicking with my peoples' then my partner, them my round'
Quality is what we seek, I'm not playing 'til we peak
Quintessential to survival is the cunnin' to compete
You picked defeat, if your efforts will only ever be passive aggressive
Be my pleasure to let it fly like attached to propellers
And compel all your people to say your prayer in your passin'
Man fuck the gassin', I'm too persistent, and what could they tell us, huh?
I been on my P's and Q's, quantum leaps ahead of my peers
They not even in my peripheral, pray I keep it proper
Cause they playin' so political, the petty is so pitiful
Niggas Peter Pettigrew, I'm of a higher pedigree
I'm peddling this penmanship, appreciate the pleasantries, but
It's quiet for y'all niggas
I mean, you know I've been on point with it
Ain't even gotta smoke a joint
I'm getting high off the feel, y'all just trying to make some coins with it
Educate my loins
You've been gifted like I pearled a couple poinsettias
On my P's and Q's
Quarantine the phrase, you could comprehend it better, bring phonetics into play, I'm no pharaoh
Message never mystical
Breath of antihistamine, I'm trying to heal the physical
Requiring a pivotal stance
For my mans niggas, know I'm not dolo
Provide you with the proof, it's never quid pro quo tho
It's Free Nation, please no photos
Yeah, power to the people, middle finger to the popo

// Perception //

[Mick Jenkins:]
Wolves in disguise
How you supposed to see 'em with the wool in your eyes?
Sheep to the radio, we fooled their surprise
They ain't ever loved me, it's bullshit and lies

[Hook:]
Puffin' on the flower, pull it through your nose
Not to say you bleed
But I'm Austin Powers, I remember gold
Tell me what you see, tell me what you know
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know, tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)

[Verse - Mick Jenkins:]
Back down, we been up longer
Winter came, so you know I had to put the Mac down
Get my cuff on like a new suit
6'5, young Bruce Bruce
Pack strong, that's Bruce Banner off to vegitary
With the couscous, black clouds
'Bout to rain down on the new cool
Like it ain't shit, monsoon when we brainstorm, that's the same shit
Muthafucka, this is art trap, you can see the verses like I'm paintin' shit
With some paintballs, shots sound like Goose Goose
Willy Wonka, I got no cellings, if I do, I finna need a new roof, fuck a limitation
Regardless I was gonna be here, fuck an invitation, what's a golden ticket?
Tell these niggas I don't need the juice, show these niggas how I got the stripes
Now they look at me like I'm Beetle Juice with a zebra cape
Soo many vision how you see the truth
Court vision can't you see the floor?
I'mma lead the break in monotony
Treat the game like Monopoly, it's no snake shit
Just cottonmouth from the botany, I mean obviously we get it
It's obviously that this shit's circus
I'm obviously flee wit it, they'll take the world, they'll break the world
Then look at us like we did it, I'm...

[Hook:]
Puffin' on the flower, pull it through your nose
Not to say you bleed
But I'm Austin Powers, I remember gold
Tell me what you see, tell me what you know
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see
Tell me what you know, tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see
Tell me what you know
(All of these niggas perceptions)

[Bridge - TheMIND:]
How do you not see the world?
Views from the fifth dimension
They slip intentions in every love
I've seen the promised person, who wings that will never fly
They call us special barrows
Carried us to our borrow, we see how we
I don't get why, why, why, why

[Hook:]
I remember gold, tell me
Tell me what you know
Tell me what you see, oh
Tell me what you see, tell me what you see, oh
Tell me what you know

All of these niggas perceptions
Damn, all of these niggas perceptions
Damn, all of these niggas perceptions
