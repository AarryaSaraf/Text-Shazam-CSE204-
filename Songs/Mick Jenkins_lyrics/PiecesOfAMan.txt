(Yea, yea)
(Yes)
Good to be here
I'm excited that many of you can come out
And share these vibrations with us
My name of course, excuse me
My name of course is Mick Jenkins
My organization and my family is called Free Nation
And we are here this evening to give you some free thought
Some food for thought
We've been breaking bread over thoughts concerning the man
From place to place
With face to face conversation
Which can be an easy thing to lose sight of
In the light of this digital age
What we are talking about concerning the man
Is a red hot case of dot dot dit dit dot dash
The remorse code
The damned if I know
Dot dot dit dit dot dot dash means damned if I know
And the reason this has become such a popular phrase in different black communities around the nation
Is because there are more and more things black people thought they had a handle on that they sorta seen slowly slip away from them
More and more things the black man specifically has kinda just let go

Pieces of a man

// Stress Fracture //

You can catch me
On the wave no jet ski
Ice cold no Gretsky
I don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real
I don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all
I don't got dollars to deepen my pockets
Still got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels
Cause I look good (look good)
I dress good (look good, dress good)
Smoke good (smoke good)
I stress a lot (stress a lot)

Who do I run to
The papers in frontal the pain that is subdue
They can't see me undo
They can't see me undone, I'm too lit right now
I'm big on the internet, pretend I ain't into that

Love provides the fruit that don't live too far from the tree
A piece of mind for her, the other half I can't be
Why should I give a fuck about feelings? (feelings)
My heart's getting cold (iceberg, ice cold)
A piece of me to you is getting it
Harder

It's been in my experience that whenever you show yourself
For real, for real, you know
Motherfuckers like to take advantage, standing there naked you panic
When vantage points don't get expanded
They offer you anecdotes based on the man that you were
More than the men that you plan to be
I go right back to the cannabis
It's harder to change the intangibles
But I know I didn't get this way randomly
Handing me cards that were played in advance
So while I poke her face, she stare grinning handsomely
Six hands ahead of me, it had to be
Clean up my school, and janitor habits he gladly see
But there's just some things that I never speak
There's some things that

You can catch me (but you can't catch me that's the thing)
On the wave no jet ski
Ice cold no Gretsky
I don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real
I don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all
I don't got dollars to deepen my pockets
Still got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels
Cause I look good (look good)
I dress good (look good, dress good)
Smoke good (smoke good)
I stress a lot (stress a lot)

Who do I run to?
The papers in frontal the pain that is subdue
They can't see me undo
They can't see me undone
I'm too lit right now
I'm big on the internet
I'm big on the internet

We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

Quick fast, quick fast, plus one that's quick math
Quicksand, sink slow for some quick cash
Quit that, got a better chance with bitcoin
Big banks see you stuntin' and this shit's deep
Crypt keep and now you're fucking with the block chain
Speed race until we running out of octane
I brought loud, you brought Reggie that's a mismatch
We not on the same page, it's just no, no way
Can't sauce through the beef this ain't bowling aye
Don't get mad because I roll it straight
Bowl a strike, new pants and I feel I need some more again
Tryna write while they bite, I'm not Holyfield
Disagree with the nigga but they know you real
They gon' see for themselves, know I told you so
Can't teach and young nigga, he don't want to know
Could be a flower, he don't want to grow

Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

Pardon my judgement, and its worth
I'm trying to be reflective, don't mean to be overt with it
All this shit connected no cursive, it's more cohesive than simple calligraphy
Figure me, a whole different nigga than what I was meant to be
A whole different mental, with a stencil and it was incidental
This was way before followers when I was following
Wasn't until a bit later when I started flowering
And I needed pollination not your validation
Til they tell you, you ain't shining that's the provocation
I be speaking on the humble in the conversation
Who would think that I still copped a Cuban link
It was thrifting, now it's Barney's it's that newer mink
Barnes & Noble savage army nigga, who you read?
One stroke of the pen for your eulogy
You should leave, if not shit new to me
You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me
That superficial shit ain't fooling me
I'm in the party and this nigga thinks he's schooling me

Real cool
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Real cool, with your cool ass
With your cool ass
Die soon
We, real cool
We, left school
We, learned late
We, seen scene
We, jazz June
We, die soon
We, die soon
We, die soon with your cool ass

You niggas be too cool for me
Too many social rules for me

// Soft Porn //

Give it to me with the clothes off
You can even take the gold off
We don't need no triggers
Honest as Abe Lincoln
Why do it feel like I take it?
What's so hard about the naked truth?
I scream about it until I change it
And still I wonder am I breaking through at all?

But hey, but hey, we look good
We a real nice, black
Dark chocolate, ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't got to front, I know what you want
I could meet you where you at
With the naked truth

Talk dirty to me with it too, give me hot takes
Give me proof, give a chance to prove, let a man improve
Imma say I grew, they gon' say I pulled a switch-aroo
But they is who? All that jogging in place is cool
But that shit stayed in school for me partly because
Somebody was brutally honest
Pointed out social constructs, I foolishly honored
I booted the false concepts that diluted the water
Was tryna be true to the nigga I was claiming to be
Now I'm really real
Tryna get old like a Philly Shell
Don't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words of poetry
The polarizing social content posted I got more of the type and it all took a sprite
From advice from one that wouldn't consider nice, that's alright, it helped me take flight
I used to fall, but the flow is so velvety that we still had the Velveeta stacking nice
Really flexing our appetizing, I ain't stressing too hard

But hey, but hey, we look good
We a real nice, black
Dark chocolate, ain't no more sitting in the back
Ain't got to front, I know what you want
I could meet you where you at
With the naked truth

I dare you to strip it down, it's plenty dollars out here
They'll pay you to keep it on, they'll pop your collar as long as you go and play the role
I'm popping bottles of starch, niggas know I can't fold
I hope your water as smart as you claim to be online
They call you by your username offline, I usually pay no mind
I just cannot get used to niggas using that shit to define themselves
You'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas
You confuse me every time you say that you feelinâ free
Can't see where my ceiling be
Think that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from
We just ain't there mentally
Expose myself to myself what the fuck you running from fam?
We can feel your energy
The hate gon' always gonna cost you so the love is complimentary
Wallet full of centuries I still can't get the time back
Protect the pocket like a lineback
Where these niggas draw the line at?
Don't let me find out that they don't draw one at all
I spit the naked truth, I'm drawing it raw
I speak on it all, not peaking at all
No valleys in sight, I rally to fight
For the naked truth

// Grace & Mercy //

Wake up thanking God (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Wake up, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies

It's a Game of Thrones, all I see is Cersei
I stay with the squad, still be smoking percies though
Have your weapon formed, but that shit can't hurt me
I stay in the sun, need my skin like Hershey's (yeah)
Do everything well, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
I'm 'bout to run it up, monetizing controversy
Bitch you want cut with us
Playing all the roles where the fuck is Eddie Murphy?
Niggas thirsty, you want poppin' shit in person
Niggas Hercules on the internet
Ain't no bitch in me, come and search me
Slutted out, high fashion fam, I'm fly with my silhouette
Thousand thread count, soft-ass niggas prone to pillow talk
Neighbors think it's dope, dodging comet with these kilowatts
Six-figure quote off a motherfucking keynote presentation
That's a Ted talk, say less let the bread talk

Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies
Every day I wake up thanking God
Yeah, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies (ay)
Wake up thanking God
Ay, wake up thanking God for these brand new mercies

I got on my knees, said a prayer, caught a blessing on these niggas
Count my blessings on these niggas, count my blessings

// Barcelona //

Look, straight up and down, I never did the crooked
They offered twenty, I'm worth more, I told my nigga, "book it"
Praise God my position isn't make or break it
I just wanted to spend the weekend in Spain
I meant it nice, don't give a fuck about how niggas took it
Awkward stares, like what the fuck you lookin' at?
And that's all over the world
I'm no nigga with dreams of bustin' all over your girl
That's belittling, bigger schemes, we been scribblin', notice it's plural
Dividends tricklin' three ways due to the penmanship
I do shows in my leisure and all these sinks is residual
Pop out occasional for the sake of relationships
Sanitize after handshakes and treat the weed like it's Ritalin
Tryna give you a visual
Fuck all this censorship man, niggas too sensitive
If yo comfort ain't pivoting you ain't listenin' right
Granny praying for it, she say we ain't Christian-ing right!
Even water can't save mixin' dark with the light
Corner the art with the business, no beauty mark, but my point is these niggas runnin' with scissors and headed straight for the plug
Mogul talkin' business movin' at the pace of a slug
Left the trail, had to bail, knew his heart wasn't in it
How you up, banger, then catch Parkinson's with it? I mean...
[Sighs]
Lot of y'all hear that line and gon' know it well
I be on my show improve, not much show-and-tell
Then the whole defense about it be so Colin Powell
[Sighs]

I was speedin', had to slow it down
Off the fertilizer, nigga growin' now
I mean, enterprisin', been compartmentalizin' all my shit
A tornado flew around my room before you came, I straightened it
Right before yo eyes you see my stains, see me basically

Pickin' up the pieces

// Percy Interlude //

Nigga
Somebody had got enough courage to be like, uh you gonna pass that?
I wasn't about to ask that man
Cuz I already knew what time it was
Ray looked at that nigga and was like nah boy
You see, it's a percy, you see
And niggas was like what?
I already knew what he said
When niggas was looking at him like what I was like nigga that's a personal
Like the closest you gonna get to hitting that jawn is sniffing it

// Reginald //

Aye, feeling like that nigga, these days my skin is much clearer
My woman's skin is much clearer, of course I'm drinking my water
Don't spend too much time in mirrors
Reflections will get you caught up
Connections will get you brought up in conversation
You basing everything you know about me from moments, I'm more a compilation
Of composition, it's complicated, I've contemplated so many perspectives
Accommodated my vices, exonerated emotions and I'm coping, Macaulay Culkin
I'm trapping my demons over Bohemian Rhapsody
They draw lines at our Widow's Peak, we don't peak at capacity
Casually giving no fucks about your two cents, we gon' clip the loose ends
We gon' clip the split ends, we gon' split ends, we gon' burn the nooses
They tried to exclude us, they lied to include us
My tribe is of Judah, your kind is of Judas
I ordered the Caesar, no Brutus among us, uprootin' the fungus
These niggas is leeches, they learning down from us

Don't you get to counting up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fucking with the flow
If it's Reggie, then I got to let you know
Keep it that real, niggas already know
Don't you get to counting up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fucking with the flow
If it's Reggie, then I got to let you know (I got to let you know)
Keep that real, niggas already do

What you want to do about me telling the truth? I get it, you're sensitive
And I don't say that with malice, my intentions are pensive and poignant
Opinions annoying, as they are of often informant
I'm critically thinking I'm fixing my form
And my shooting percentage is rising
I worked on my vertical simply by switching horizons
Colliding my will with the wave, and niggas call me Poseidon
And just call me the plug, I'm providing the drugs
In small doses, we grind, and we roll, and we smoke
And we cook, and we eat, and refocus
Repeat, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat until it's polished
Acknowledge my genius, no college degree on me
Got a few G's with me, got an O-Z on me
It's some OG homie, don't you count that paper on me homie

Don't you get to counting up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fucking with the flow
If it's Reggie, then I got to let you know
Keep it that real, niggas already know
Don't you get to counting up another nigga dough
Don't call me a hater just because I wasn't fucking with the flow
If it's Reggie, then I got to let you know (I got to let you know)
Keep that real, niggas already

// Padded Locks //

[Mick Jenkins:]
Somebody put me on a leash
I'm buckin' wild like the AK 'cause it came from Kaytra
I point it down so you can't escape her
Even if you duck, duck goose neck, your Canada Goose wet
Balled up from your boots to your crewneck
This that blue flame
Put the green to this shit, this that blue dream
Put your schemes to test in real life, bet you need a vest
Bet you need a vet
Niggas bitin' crazy, already seen death by rabies
Niggas gettin' lazy, diggin' holes and pushin' daisies
Boonk actin' crazy like it's gravy lookin' crazy on the internet
Niggas dirty dancin', no Patrick Swayze
Lover don't get caught on your Savion Glover for these white boys
They out here cancellin' plans at the last minute
You'll denied it then admit it, that type mad different
But I ain't mad, I'm high as a kite
Trip is supplying the light, niggas can't buy this advice
Listen, caution would question this shit, niggas that claim you bitchin'
Get straight to the money whenever your hands start itchin'
Know that if you ride me, you'll never be Mike or Pippen
And you got to know that ain't me dissin'
Dodgin' smokescreens, that ain't the piff in the air or, niggas is smokin' different
Could read the same Bible but, niggas quote it different
They finna do clean water just like prohibition
I already know the mission, why they keep on missin', we grow more efficient

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

[Ghostface Killah:]
Ay yo, these nigga mad thirsty for the fame and glory
Yous as basic as a baby daddy on Maury
Fuck the fake chain blingin', autotune singin'
I'm a killer bee straight out the hive and I'm stingin'
Dirty slang doctor botox your girl's lips up
We soul training 'em like Don Corneil, get your dick sucked
We fist fuckin' the money, we runnin' down jewelers
We flooded backstage out like ice in the coolers
Fuck the rulers, Donald Trump is a piece of shit
I got 36 chambers, hollow tip in the clip
Smoke a dick, no time for the games and dramatics
We blessed every morning with today's mathematics
Put a hole in your cabbage, quick to fuck up your party
Off your whole set nigga, you can ask Cardi
We used to lose our cracks when we was runnin' from the Narci
Now we watchin' shark tank, robes up in the Marqis

[Mick Jenkins:]
Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

Gotta have it
Please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin'
Make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics
We get through them locks when they padded
I never had it
Got to get to free, got to have it

You never really see me out, I be on the road
Or I be in the crib, when I'm not on the road
I'm working on my penmanship, and my relationship
I put in hard work, you cannot fake this shit
You never really see me out
Ghost
Ghost
Ghost
You never see me

I dig my personal space
Put the flower in the paper, put the earth to my face
With my lady and we lay there for the girth of the day
It's worth it to say, I do this for a whole different purpose
It's kind of high key, I'm low key
But to clarify, I really just been more focused on me
You can verify these claims with anybody that know me
Singing my words nigga, I don't do karaoke
And define worth to me 'cause I won't win the trophy
I been watching it closely
All that glitter just garnishing, I'm more partial to parsley
And all the medals will tarnish
You played your hardest and they ate your heart out
I beg your pardon, I'm more Harden I can't ride the bench about it
Even if they claim I bitched about it
Knew I had the eagle eye, couldn't remain pigeon about it
Speak about it, even win, especially when my pigment doubted
They couldn't fuck with the vision, and now you see me in vintage frames
Percentage rose when the interest came
All that hate just fanned a bigger flame
I'm simply saying when I'm sane, I go super saiyan
I supersede all them niggas that go with the grain
That's why you never see me in that lane

You never really see me out, I be on the road
Or I be in the crib, when I'm not on the road
I'm working on my penmanship, and my relationship
I put in hard work, you cannot fake this shit
You never really see me out
Ghost
Ghost
Ghost
You never see me

Back on my bullshit
You know I'm preaching, don't need a pulpit
Who'll be a culprit if we really talking stealing flows
I hate the fake in my heart when break on a serial raises
But the real do my shit just like Cheerios
Hearing more voices that try to influence choices I make
I'm out my shell but all I see is oysters
Phonies kicking it, they just imposters
Fish out of water, now I need that moisture
He don't react to the heat like pasta
Too much backbone, check his posture
He dance with wolves young Kevin Costner
And canoes through this Water World
With the logic of a Spock, if I retreat I'm simply tryna prosper
What do diamonds do under pressure?
I feel the weight of landing helicopters
Just to get up here and find out they read teleprompter
Fuck is conscious if you woke, but you still in the bed
A lot of y'all realities is only in your head
Then you bring that shit to me and you expect agreeance
I'm disagreeing with your take on all this shit instead
But, I don't be trying to do the most so I digress
I take it down, I fade to black, I get on with this

You never really see me out, I be on the road
Or I be in the crib, when I'm not on the road
I'm working on my penmanship, and my relationship
I put in hard work, you cannot fake this shit
You never really see me out
Ghost
Ghost
Ghost
You never see me
