// Your Secret Love //

Oh, yes
A kiss in the dark
A certain time I can call you
A letter of love
But no name did you sign
Pretending to all
That we were just friends when I saw you
I didn't know that you wanted me to be
I didn't know that you wanted me for your
(For your) To be

[1] - Your secret love
Why can't we tell somebody
'Cause secret loves
Never last as long
Your secret love
Will never be your true love
I can't be no secret baby
It's breakin' my heart
(You're breaking my heart)

You should've let me know, from the first time baby
That you were not, were not free to love
How could you wait so long
Oh, what a waste of love, baby
I should known that you wanted me to be
I should known
That you wanted me for your (for your) to be
[repeat 1]

I won't be you secret love
'Cause it's just a waste of my love
I'm tellin' you from the start
I won't be the one who gives you love
When your other guy ain't givin' you none

Don't come now, wait for awhile
Let's meet at the place downtown
It's a shame it has to be like this
But I really miss you baby

// Love Don't Love You Anymore (TM's Urban Mix) //

Ay, love don't love you 
Hey, love, ah ha

Time rushes on
And it's not fair
When someone you used to love
Is no longer there
But I think it's time you know
See love is a society
Any fool can not belong
Cuz the minute you hurt love
Then it's over and done

Love don't love you anymore
No more, shoulda never done wrong
Love don't love you anymore
No, no

Love is a ride, up and down, yeah
You did what you did to love
And I betcha know now
Cuz there's no one else around
And now you're running back to me
To forgive you your mistake
Kinda makes me sad to say but
It's a little too late

Love don't love you anymore
No more, no more, no more, no more
Love don't love you anymore
And oh love, ooo, love
Love, love's not coming home
Ain't it hard to believe
Baby, baby, baby
Love, love's not coming home, hey

It seems to be that
You're the one
The one who did bad things to love
It's sad to see, so sad to tell
But now we'll never hear the bells

Love sure don't love you 
Love sure don't want you 
Love sure don't love you 
Anymore, anymore
And it's a shame

Love sure don't love you 
No it don't
Love sure don't want you 
I know, I know
Love sure don't love you 
Anymore, anymore

Love don't love you anymore
Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore
Love don't love you baby
Love, love you anymore
Love sure don't love you anymore, anymore

It's a shame that
Love don't love you baby
Love don't love you honey
Ain't it hard to believe
No, no, no, no
Love don't love you baby
Any love don't love ya honey

// It's Hard For Me To Say //

Didn't know 'til today
That you would love for me to say
All of things I feel
Though you don't doubt they're real
Insecure, very shy
Are the only reasons I have why
I never say the things that you would love to hear
All the words I try
Disappoint me and I cry
So they're words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why
Kinda sad, kinda blue
Because I wanted to tell you
That you were in my heart
Though we were far apart
Didn't know how to say
All the little things to make you stay
And not to keep assuming
You could read my mind
You're the one I love
Though it's hard for you to know
'Cause the words I don't always say, but
It's in my love, it's in my feeling
It's in the very same heart that loved you from the start
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit
And it's got me totally high
It's just hard for me to say why
