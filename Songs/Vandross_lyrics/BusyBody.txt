// I Wanted Your Love //

Yeah, your love...

All of the band was on time for rehearsal
And played everything just right
Then came the news telling me not to worry
The show is selling out tonight
Well, the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream
And as you could well imagine, it was like living a dream
Oh, but when the lights went down and the standing "O" was done
I was just another lonely guy who didn't have no one

[Chorus:]
(I wanted your love, your love baby, your love baby, your love)
(Your love, your love, love, love love, love)
Give me your love, give me your love, give me your love
(I wanted your love, your love baby, your love baby, your love)
(Your love, your love, love, love love, love)
Well Well, your love

So busy daydreaming 'bout you, baby
I didn't even hear the phone
Then, when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me
They said, we're so glad you're home
You just won a million dollars and a trip around the world
Better get yourself together and forget about that girl
They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too
But all the money in the world could never take the place of you

[Chorus]

All over the city the lights were so pretty
The holiday was filled with cheer
The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin'
It was the special part of the year
So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say I do
Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasn't you
We had told the world that we were gonna ring the wedding bell
But when I really thought about it I was lying to myself

[Chorus]

[Fade]

// Busy Body //

I'm so downhearted 'cause what had started
Out to be love has now dearly departed
There's no reason for you to be leaving
I wish you would stay, but you're a...

[Chorus:]
Busy body
Giving all your lovin' to just anybody
A busy body
Holding, kissing, loving, hugging any body

If it would have lasted it would have been fantastic
But when the morning came you were gone
All your one night standin' must take a lot of plannin'
But I don't think you'll last for very long
'Cause you've got a...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
All I ever
Wanted to do was love you, baby
Gotta believe me
I'm hopelessly into you

I can hear love calling
And I can't believe I'm falling
For somebody
Who'll never be all mine
I've got to stop the fire
I can't let it get no higher
But, I'm so afraid I'm running out of time
'Cause you've got a...

[Chorus]

[Fade]

// I'll Let You Slide //

Back to back and side to side
There's only music on my mind
Nothing to worry about but the beat
I wanted you to come and dance with me
But you wanted to stay home and watch TV
Ahhh, but when I got there to my surprise
There was another guy looking into your eyes

[Chorus 1:]
I don't want, don't want us to fuss and fight
From right now 'til tomorrow night
So if you promise to love only me and be by my side
I'll let you slide

Without a doubt tonight is the night
That we gon' really roll when the time is right
And we're gonna carry it into the dawn
Oh, but where are you, where can you be
I've been waiting, it seems an eternity
I took our favorite song from the record stack
It was Hey, Jimmy Mack
When are you coming back

[Chorus 2:]
Well, I'm so disappointed you're gone tonight
'Cause your love is the spice of my life
But if you hurry back in the mornin'
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight
Up and down, pacing round, walking in my sleep
'Cause you've got a promise to keep
You've got to come back
And love, love, love, love, love me right
And, huh, I'll let you slide tonight

[Bridge:]
I can't wait til tomorrow, baby
Can't you come over tonight
I can't get to sleep, my baby
Come and rock my cradle left to right
I tossed and turned and called you up
But there wasn't anybody home
It makes me sad, I need you bad
But I guess I'm just gonna have to wait until tomorrow comes
Slide, I knew it, I knew it
How could you do it
Slide, it's alright, I'll let you slide tonight

I hired me a private eye
To ceck up on your cool little alibis
And what he discovered was woeful to me
Baby, if you intend to stay with me
Then you can't see the guys that I know you see
Come on, let's ake up and promise to start anew
Let's take the morning off, I've got some plans for you

[Chorus 3:]
Making love by the moon can be mitghty fine
But when the sun rises, so do I
So if you rock it to me in the mornnig
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight
Really missed you today, I was on the run
So wake me up when the morning comes
I think I'll dance to some music and groove on the party light
And let you slide tonight

[Fade]

Get up, oooh, let's love baby
If you do it nice in the mornin'
Then alright, I'll let you slide tonight

Get up, ooh, let's love baby
If we do it twice in the mornin'
Well alright, I'll let you slide tonight

Get up, ooh, let's love baby
If it's really nice in the mornin'
It's alright, I'll let you slide tonight

// Make Me A Believer //

Superman can fly high way up in the sky
'Cause we believe he can
So what we choose to believe can always work out fine
It's all in the mind
So think of a place and imagine a time
(Imagine a time, imagine a time)
And let's go be lovers

Believing me, Ooo wee baby
Is believing right, yeah yeah yeah
And...

[Chorus:]
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl (Girl)
So make me a believer
(Wanna love, wanna love, wanna love, wanna love, wanna love, wanna girl)
I wanna love, wanna have, wanna hold you girl (Girl)

[Interlude:]
Ooo so near
And forever keep you here
Forget all about whatever we fear (Whatever we fear)
And let's just be lovers
Loving and loving, oh love is the way
To make me stay, make me stay

Yeah, I know the way to persuade me over to your side
And I am sure you can
So if you get me to believe
It all will work out fine
'Cause you'll blow my mind
So let's pick a place and a day and a time (A place and a day and a time)
And then we'll be lovers
Loving and loving, oh love is the way
To make me stay, make me stay

[Chorus]

// For The Sweetness Of Your Love //

What's your name
Girl, what's your number
I think I fell in love the first time I ever saw ya
And I couldn't get you off my mind, Hey Hey
You reminded me of candy
So you be my Mary Jane
And I'll be your Sugar Daddy
And we can make sweet love all the time
Ooh girl

[Chorus:]
I'd travel to the farthest star
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
You're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Much sweeter than the sugar in a candy bar
(Is the sweetness of your love)
Yeah, talkin' 'bout
And my rocket would only stop
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well, Well (Well, Well) Hey
All I ever think about
(Is the sweetness of your love)
What ya say
(Say Yeah Yeah) Yeah Yeah

You call for it, I'll deliver
I'll bring you anything
So fast it'll make you shiver
Whatever it is, from A to Z, Hey Hey
Let me prove that I can love ya
I'll do a dance for you
Anything that I can to get a chance to love you
Of whomever you dream, I wanna be

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'd take my money out the bank
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd buy you a great big diamond ring
(For the sweetness of your love)
'Cause Ooo baby, I'd do anything
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
'Cause you're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

And I'd go 10 rounds with Sugar Ray
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd eat my Wheaties everday
(For the sweetness of your love)
BANG! ZOOM! And he would fly away
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well Well Yeah Yeah

You could be lost in danger with a stranger
Caught up in mystery
A one night insanity, girl
And quite an emotional tragedy it would be
Then I'd come running just to save you
I'd be your hero guy
In a flash, in a minute I'd be there in no time
And you'd be forever loving me

[Chorus]

Sweet, sweet (Sweet, sweet)
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd say Ooo wee
(Ooo wee, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd be what you want me to be
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
'Cause you're so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet

Say Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)
(For the sweetness of your love)
And I'd go anywhere
(Anywhere, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd call you up when I got there
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Yeah Yeah Yeah
(Sweet, sweet for the sweetness of your love)
Ooo wee (Ooo wee, for the sweetness of your love)

I'd be what you want me to be
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Well, Well (Well, Well)
Say Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)
(For the sweetness of your love)
I'd follow you anywhere
(Anywhere, for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd call you up when I got there
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
(Sweet, Sweet, for the sweetness of your love)
(Ooo wee for the sweetness of your love)
And I'd even wrestle Mister T
(For the sweetness of your lovin')
Yeah Yeah (Yeah Yeah)

// How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye //

Here we are so close to the end now
Still holding on and trying to pretend now
Clinging to love we both know is dying
We've tried and tried to find the solution
But Darling
All our dreams have been played out
Still we go on hopelessly trying

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we see love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye

We're so in love but wrong for each other
Each hurt that heals brings on another
Both of us abusing
Both of us using
Darling
It's time to stop pretending
There's just no way to rewrite our ending
We're caught in this game
And we both know we're losing, but

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we see love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye

How many times can we breakup and makeup
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up
Just can't go on and on
Living a lie
Though I'll always love you

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we watch love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye
Bye-bye
Good-bye
Bye-bye

Good-bye
