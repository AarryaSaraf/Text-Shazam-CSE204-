Album: Dangerous

// Jam //

[Michael Jackson:]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't, It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam

[Heavy D:]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Making funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man 'cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4s in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to

[Michael Jackson:]
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

Get on it
It ain't too much stuff

Don't stop
It ain't too much for me to

It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam (Chh, chh, chh!)
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam (Get down, hoo!)
Ooh!

Give it, baby
Give it to me
Come on
You really give it to me
Got to give it
You just want to give it

// Why You Wanna Trip On Me //

They say I'm different
They don't understand
But there's a bigger problem
That's much more in demand
You've got world hunger
Not enough to eat
So there's really no time
To be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers
Who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people
Who can't write or read
You got strange diseases
Ah but there's no cure
You got many doctors
That aren't so sure
So tell me

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'

We have got more problems
Than we will ever need
You got gang violence
And bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people
With no food to eat
With no clothes on their back
And no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction
In the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption
Police brutality
We've got streetwalkers
Walking into darkness
Tell me
What are we doing
To try to stop this?

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

(Why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why, why, why, why)
Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Ooh stop trippin'
Yeah stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'

Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
Stop trippin'

// In The Closet //

There is something I have to say to you
If you promise you'll understand
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

She's just a lover who's doing me by
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wants to give it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

It's just a feeling, you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (She wanna get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust to woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby (Oh)
Just promise me whenever we say (And we get it)
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow (Never knew)
To just keep it in the closet

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it

She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Get it)
She wants to give it (Yeah)
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it

Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell
Oh, because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you, baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you, baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other (Whatever we do)
For now we'll make a vow
To just keep it in the closet

She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it (Dare me)
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Dare me
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
She wants to give it (Keep it in the closet)
She wants to give it
Oh, she wants to give it (Dare me)

// She Drives Me Wild //

She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine

She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin'
'Cause I've seen her look better

She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Come to the place, shock to see
And you know damn well you know what I mean

Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip, like you've never seen

Uh-huh!

Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
And she knows she looks hot

She's got position
She's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild
I might not make it
Uh-huh!
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
Uh-huh!
Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You walk is soft, still I hear the medley
Uh-huh! Shiver my Timberland boots, cramp my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

[Repeat with ad-libs until the end:]
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

// Remember The Time //

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall
We'd be together all day long?
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

Do you remember, back in the spring
Every morning, birds would sing?
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And, girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Hoo! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, hoo!
(Remember the time, remember the time)

// Can't Let Her Get Away //

I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)

I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But every time I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye (Still you said goodbye)

If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling, trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling, she's never gonna try
I got the feeling, she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling, her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling, she's out to play
Can't let go
Can't let go

I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

// Heal The World //

Think about—um—the generations and they say we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they they they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow

And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving

If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
To make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace

Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers

Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me

You and for me
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)

Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children

[Dad:] Hey!
[Kid:] What?!
[Dad:] Turn that off!
[Kid:] Dad, this is the best part!
[Dad:] Turn it off!

[Michael Jackson:]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
Ooh

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh

Don't look at that

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

[L.T.B.:]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Michael Jackson:]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to be that (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to be that (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo! (Shamone, dah)

// Who Is It //

I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside a dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

Hee-hee, hee-hee
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
To me, I'm bothered
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)

And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

// Give In To Me //

She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay, yes it's okay
You won't be laughing, girl, when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'd, I'd never find
Better, a peace of mind, no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me

I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
I'd like a lady
Talk to me, baby
Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Love is wrong
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling

// Will You Be There //

Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen

Hold me
Like the river Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Weary
Tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
Show me
(Lay your head lowly)
Told me
(Softly then boldly)
Yeah
(Carry me there)
I'm only human

(Lead me)
Hold me
(Love me and feed me)
Yeah, yeah
(Kiss me and free me)
Yeah
(I will feel blessed)
I'm only human

(Carry)
Carry
(Carry me boldly)
Carry, yeah
(Lift me up slowly)
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)
I will be there

(Lift me)
Told me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
Yeah
(Show me you care)
Show me you care

(Hold me)
Woo
(Lay your head lowly)
It gets lonely sometimes
(Softly then boldly)
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
Woo
(Love me and feed me)
Lift me up, hold me up
(Kiss me and free me)
Lift me up sometimes, oh, sometimes
(I will feel blessed)
Yeah

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?

In my trials
And my tribulations
Through our doubts
And frustrations

In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear
And my confessions

In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

// Keep The Faith //

If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis?
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance

Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it, brother
You got it

And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?
And you can go by the feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

So keep the faith (Oh)
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better, but you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it

I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has to make it right
Makes it, uh, makes it right

So keep the faith (Go)
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

And better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what ya doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together 'cause you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down, brother (Keep the faith)
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life
You best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go'n keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith (Keep the faith)
Go'n keep it sister (Keep the faith)
You got to keep the faith
Now, now

I showed my brother
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
Go for what you want (Keep the faith)
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
If you keep'a the faith
Straighten out yourself (Keep your faith)
And get your mind on track (Oh yeah)
Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back
You've known me too long (Oh yeah)
To know that I don't play (Oh yeah)
Take it like you wanna
But you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize (Keep the faith)
And get your feet back on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah (Keep the faith)
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
But 'til that day
I say you've got to keep the faith (Hmm)

// Gone Too Soon //

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon

Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon

Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon

Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon

// Dangerous //

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me," I said, "I have no time." (Hee-hee!)
She said, "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone." (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said, "You know my name."
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before."
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Whoa!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me "honey", but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Dangerous
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!
Dangerous, dangerous
Hoo!
