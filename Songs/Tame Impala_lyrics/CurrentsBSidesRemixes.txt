// List Of People (To Try And Forget About) //

Now I gotta' add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Now I gotta' add yours to my list of faces to not think about
Now I gotta' tell em' I don't care and hope that nobody might work it out
It was obviously an illusion cos' there's never been so much I've been wrong about
And I don't want to spend all my days thinking of the one I can't live without
So I'm gonna' have to add you to my list of people to try and forget about
Trying forâ¦

And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
Don't think my heart will try
But it was waiting here

So now I gotta add you to my list of people to try and forget about
It could've been magic
Nearly had ya'
Could you imagine
Nearly had ya'

Til' it becomes another one of the things that I just can't talk about
I'm gonna have to keep you on my list of people to try and forget about
Try and...

And as the years go by
Your name will fade out gradually
They'll think my heart won't try
But it was waiting in the wings

And as the years go by
You're still a banished memory
They'll say my love has died
But it was waiting in the wings

// Taxi's Here //

I was trying to resolve and I'm waiting
It felt natural
Oh I was hoping it would come out right
Who was I kidding

Push the button and start counting down
Oh, time is crawling to the moment
Beyond which
I can choose
I can fall
I can lose
Control
I concur with the doubt
But I can't turn back round
And they trip
What's beyond
But time is rolling on

Now let's do this right
Everybody
(And I'll be trying)
It won't come out right

I can fold
I can lose
Control
I can lose
Control
I can face the unknown
Yes, I must
Venture there
If I fail, I don't care

(Now let's do this right)
There's so much
Left unclear
But it's time
Taxi's here

// Reality In Motion (Gum Remix) //

I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
It's way too real, baby
He said, lack of composure, baby
Carry on

I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, baby

Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me

You don't need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I could sense you doubt me
You don't need to

// Let It Happen (Soulwax Remix) //

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"

I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)

(It's gonna feel so good)

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen"
(It's gonna feel so good)

I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Tryna get through it, Tryna get through it
Try to bounce to it
You were not thinkin' that I will not do it
Why would I do it?
They be lovin' someone and I'm not that stupid
Take the next ticket toâ
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it?
And you wanna think thatâ
And you wannaâ

(It's gonna feel so good)
(It's gonna feel so good)
(I will be holding on)

Let it happen, let it happen
Let it happen, let it happen
All this running around, trying to cover my shadow
An ocean growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning
(It's gonna feel so good)
Let it happen, let it happen
Just pet it happen, let it happen
(It's gonna feel so good)
