// The Boat I Row //

Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Sayin', "It's so obvious,"
But really they don't know
(They don't know, they don't know shit)
Just like a monster that is only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'

Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes a hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause that's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be

Endless
Problems, relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run 'til I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward I go

Many ways to go

// No Choice //

It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
And if you're telling me that I've got so much to lose
All the talking about it, it's all noise

Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?

Let it out
I can see it now
Tryin' to hold down
I hear it now

All the constants in your future bore you
Kinda makes your mind up for you
Knowing just what lies before you
Gives you no surprise

It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?

// Breathe Deeper (Lil Yachty Remix) //

[Lil Yachty:]
Baby girl wanna kick it
Spend late nights, tryna impress the wicked
Off two tabs, I'm gone
Mind too fried, couldn't remember the digits
She want a glass of Prosecco
The bitch that she with trippin', leave her at the Petco
I'm still the same kid from the metro
She ride out of drugs, had to ball call petrol
Lookin' in her eyes, see the meadow
Lookin' at her lips, pillow kiss, it's the wet throat
She say she never been to the ghetto
Put her on the tab, turn the hood to a disco
Now she rockin', and I'm rockin', and we feelin' it out
All that energy I held in, I'm givin' it out
I forgot 'bout my problems, I'm livin' it up
I can not feel my feet, I been dancin'
I been grindin' my teeth while she rantin'
Everybody shut the fuck up and start dancin'

Gridnin' my teeth while she rantin'
Look in my eyes, I can't touch, it's the madness

[Kevin Parker:]
Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

[Lil Yachty:]
Dim lights, tonights, wanna go again
Loose legs, all on my back, can't feel the wind
I see stars every time I hold your hand
You can leave your car, self-drive in a brand new Benz
Loosen up your guard
Hope this shit last, I don't want it to end
Hope you do your part
I just need you to snap in both in of your hands
Mm, like that
I love the way you move when it like that
Heard you paid all of your dues with a rain check
You turned me to a fool for insane sex
You passed the love test
Join the mile-high club on the plane next
Heart beatin' like [?]
I can't wait to shut the fuck up and dance though

[Kevin Parker:]
Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper
Should you need to come undone
And let those colours run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this
And come find me when you're done
So we can be as one

[Lil Yachty:]
Remember those lies you told your friend?
I was hopin' you could do it once more again
That rooftop party won't seem to end
I need you here, alone with me
My love and my high, don't break my heart
You're all I got, you all I need
Don't leave me cold outside to rot
But I'm so depressed I feel bulimic
My soul restored, I want a call
Fuelin' your heart to me, I mean it
DMT which is inside my brain
I had dinner with God, just thank God I seen Him
Heaven's too real, the dream won't fill
Trust me, with my own eyes, baby girl, I seen it
Late night vibes, I need your high
Let me get one hit, baby girl, I'm fiendin'
In too deep to cut my ties
I'm way too hot, I just left Venus
Try my best to make you smile
Never said that I was perfect, I still fight demons
IPhone pics, I saw that story
Look drunk as fuck, I think you need me
Rubbing your body just like it's gold
Your dress is the bottle and you the genie
O-M-G, let's spice things up
I got a little bit of ecstasy in my feelings
Lovin' on you is takin' its toll
I hope you still gonna love me and that you mean it

Love me and that you mean it
Love me and that you mean it

// One More Year (NTS Version) //

Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
Now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

All we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now it's all we live for
Might be what we die for
Oh

But it's okay
I think I know a way
It's so clear
Why don't we just say, "One more year"?
One more year
One more year
Oh-oh-ah
One more year

I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might
I know we promised
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might

Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now we're shining
Nobody beside me
Future is exciting
Oh

Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

Has slowly become all we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
It might be what we die for
'Cause now we're shining
Somebody guide me
Future is exciting

One more year
One more year

// Patience (Maurice Fulton Remix) //

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone

Lay down

Lay down

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone

// Is It True (Four Tet Remix) //

We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be?

She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in myâ

I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I told my mother that I love her

She just said, "Is it true? Is it true? Tell me now"
That's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature? I don't know, I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room, here I am, back again
She's in myâ
In myâ

I said, "We'll see, we'll see" (In myâ)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see (In myâ)
We'll see
Ah, we'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
See how it goes
Until we know what the future holds
Ah, we'll see
We'll see
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see

// Borderline (Blood Orange Remix) //

Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night
Line, tides, pain
Sign, strange, night

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Go, there I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the Sun
Here comes the Sun
Ah, ah, ah

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know this high came rushing?
I said, "Come with me outside"
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away

We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?

// Patience //

Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up

Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we would have gone

They would ask me all the time
Showin' up in ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up

I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up

It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone
