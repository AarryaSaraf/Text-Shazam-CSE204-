Album: InTheseSilentDays

// Right On Time //

Come back now, even if you call me out
You might be angry now of course you are
I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you
I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room
Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can
Find ourselves again

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

Don't look down
I can feel it when your heart starts pounding
It's beyond your control, you know it is
It's getting to the point where I can't carry on
I never held my breath for quite this long
And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

It's not too late
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
It wasn't right
But it was right on time

// You And Me On The Rock //

They build wooden houses on frozen ponds
In the summertime when the water's gone
Diagonal lines in their rolled-out lawns
And the sage always smells so pretty
But nobody cares where the birds have gone
When the rain comes down on Babylon
The stonemason's phone rings all day long
And you gotta get back to the city

I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock
You and me on the rock

I built paper planes when I learned to fly
Like a 747 fallin' out of the sky
I folded 'em crooked and now I'm wonderin' why
I could always end up in the water
But nobody's askin' why she lookin' so thin
Why she's laughin' too hard, why she drinkin' again
A falling star, she's a paper plane
And she was goin' down when you caught her

I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this poor girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock

It's an earthquake, it's a hard wind
It's a record-breakin' tide and it is rollin' in
It's a big sea, but it can't touch you and me
It's just a water view
And what a view
I don't need their money, baby
Woo

I build my house up on this rock, baby
Every day with you
There's nothin' in that town I need
After everything we've been through
Me out in my garden and you out on your walk
Is all the distance this old girl can take
Without listenin' to you talk
I don't need their money, baby
Just you and me on the rock

I don't need their money, baby (I don't need their money, baby)
Just you and me on the rock (Just you and me on the rock)
You and me on the rock

// This Time Tomorrow //

When the fire inside that burns so bright begins to grow faded
It can be hard to see the ground on which you stand
Though you may not be afraid of walking in the darkness
You will feel like a stranger in this land

You can try to carve a faith out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry out the bone
And the edges of the night may cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you

When the hope that you hold tightly to has all but vanished
And there are no words of comfort to be found
You will know what it means to be lost and without love
May you fight to kill that deafening sound

But our holy dreams of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breaking of the day might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you

You can try to carve a faith out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry out the bone
And the edges of the night may cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow

But our holy dreams of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breaking of the day might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
Yeah, I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you

// Broken Horses //

I wear my father's leather on the inside of my skin
I'm a tried and weathered woman, but I won't be tried again
Don't think that you can come for me without your Sunday best
You had better call your priest and hope the devil gets the rest
Before I do
Oh, and I will do

I have worn the jester's bells and I have banished with the fools
I have worshiped at the altar of the puppet master's rules
I have held my tongue too many scenes before the final act
With my children in the cheap seats and a zipper on my back
Thanks to you
No thanks to you

Tethered in wide open spaces
And fields that lead for miles
Right into the barrel of a gun
Mendin' up your fences with my
Horses runnin' wild
Only broken horses know to run

I have ever so politely treaded softly for your grace
I have whispered through the tears and pleaded sweetly to your face
It is time to spit you out like lukewarm water from my mouth
I will always taste the apathy, but I won't pass it down
It dies with you
You

Tethered in wide open spaces
And fields that lead for miles
Right into the barrel of a gun
Mendin' up your fences with my
Horses runnin' wild
Only broken horses know to run

I wear my father's leather on the inside of my skin
I'm a tried and weathered woman, but I won't be tried again
Don't think that you can come for me without your Sunday best
You had better call your priest and hope the devil gets the rest
Before I do
Oh, and I will do

Tethered in wide open spaces
And fields that lead for miles
Right into the barrel of a gun
Mendin' up your fences with my
Horses runnin' wild
Only broken horses know to run

// Letter To The Past //

It's a game
Baby, it's just a game
And nobody loses when you learn to love the one
Who finally wins sometimes
You'll be wrong
'Cause sometimes, we get it wrong
But nobody leaves here alive
And nothin' holy comes from bein' right

So don't hold your breath like that
Baby, let it go
You're gonna feel it in your back
Believe me, I oughta know

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still bitin' your shakin' hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
But, darlin', I'll be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

You can cry
You know it's always okay to cry
You don't even need to know why
But don't you ever feel alone inside
If you need to know the truth
I still haven't got a clue
If the blind can lead the blind
Then, baby, I'm just like you

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still fightin' your empty hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
But, darlin', I'll be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

You're a stone wall
In a world full of rubber bands
You're a pillar of belief
Still hidin' your empty hands
Folks are gonna lean on you
And leave when the cracks appear
Darlin', I will be here
I'll be the last
You're my letter to the past

It's a game
You know it's okay to lose a game
But always remember your name
And have no shame
Because you're built to last

// Mama Werewolf //

Your mama is a werewolf with long, sharp teeth
I'm up all night when the world should sleep
I curse the darkness when it's killin' time
I got a river of fear runnin' through my mind
When the moon shines through those parting clouds
I hear the call and I howl out loud
I stalk the streets where the shadows lie
And I pray to God that that sun will rise
But that sun don't always rise

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun

When I awaken and I'm reborn
My body aches and my soul is torn
I search the void for any clues
And I feel ashamed for what I've put you through
This curse a gift from my father's kin
They fought the beast I feel within
But we don't talk about it and we don't call its name
We just carry on, hopin' it'll change
But we know it'll never change

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun
Would you strike me down right where I stand?
Would you change me back, make me kind again?
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun
Would you strike me down right where I stand?
Would you change me back, make me kind again?
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun

// When You're Wrong //

"Don't go borrowin' trouble," that's what you used to say
But we don't keep in touch the way we used to nowadays
Your eyes are not as bright as I remember them to be
The light inside's grown dim and that's hard for me to see

The creases on your forehead run like treads on a tire
The white stripe runnin' through your bangs a long twisted spire
You're sweepin' up the floods and you've been vacuumin' the fires
And you lay down every night next to a goddamn liar

You may be here today, but tomorrow, you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
Wrong

When the day is winding down, my heart abandons me for you
You forgot yourself so long ago and I wish I could too
But you live inside a quiet hell no one can pray away
Leavin' would be easy, I understand why you stay

You may be here today, but tomorrow, you're a ghost
I guess the most someone can hope for is to find a place to lay
Someone to tell your secrets to when the nights get long and blue
Someone strong enough to lean on when the roses fall away
Strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
When you're wrong
Mm

You'll be wrong if you were thinkin' that we all don't fade away
Like dew drops in the dawn, like sun beams through the haze
It's a long way to be sinkin', holdin' tightly to the weight
Of the one who pulls you down while you slowly waste your days

Someone strong enough to love you when you're wrong
Someone strong enough to love you when you're
Wrong
When you're wrong

Ooh-ooh
When you're wrong
Ooh, ooh

// Stay Gentle //

Stay gentle, keep the eyes of a child
Don't harden your heart or your hands
Know to find joy in the darkness is wise
Although they will think you don't understand

Don't let the world make you callous
Be ready to laugh
No one's forgotten about us
There is light on your path

Stay gentle, keep the eyes of a child
And wear your heart on your sleeve
Know to find joy in the darkness is wise
Although they will think you are naive

Don't let 'em lower your shoulders
Love 'em more while they try
Grow younger while you're growin' older
Be amazed by the sky

Darling, stay wild if you can (If you can)
The girl with the world in her hands (In her hands)
The kingdom of Heaven belongs to a boy
While his worry belongs to a man

Stay gentle, stay gentle
The most powerful thing you can do
Oh, gentle, unbreakable you

// Sinners, Saints And Fools //

Where the winds of change were blowin', there lived a God-fearing man
He was turning through his Bible when he came up with a plan
He painted up a sign and held it high above his head
Waved it proudly in the air and this is what it read

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
They keep things safe here for everyone
The Sinners, Saints, and Fools
The poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

To the weary, desperate souls who washed up on the sand
He said, "We haven't seen your paperwork" and he withdrew his hand
You know he never felt any safer, or the peace he hoped he'd find
And up until the day he died, he never changed his mind

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
We gotta keep things safe here for everyone
The Sinners, Saints, and Fools
To the poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

By the time he got to Heaven, it was surrounded by a wall
The pearly gates were locked up tight, the golden chains and all
They said, "We cannot let just anyone walk in here anymore
You didn't do it by the book," and then they pointed to the floor

You can't break the law
There are reasons for the rules
They keep things safe here for everyone
You Sinners, Saints, and Fools
To the poor and huddled masses
Who are hungry and afraid
You gotta do it by the book and there'll be
No exceptions made

No

// Throwing Good After Bad //

Ooh, ooh, ooh

I know you're leavin' me
I know I'm not your home
You want a movie dancer
You want blood from a stone
But I'm on to you
And you will pour your heart into
Any shimmering fad
Throwin' good after bad

People get addicted to
The rush, the chase, the new
Just hopin' that all that chaos
Will lead to somethin' like this
I'll get over you
But you won't be whole until you do
You won't find what you had
Throwin' good after bad

And I'll always feel a little left behind
But that lyin' wind that calls your name
Will leave you flyin' blind

Are you fantasizin'?
You're takin' us for granted
I know you're bored
You always say I'm heavy handed
You got a beautiful mind
And a soul of a coyote
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad

I know you loved me once
You were somethin' to prove
I was an unfinished song
You were nothin' to lose
I'm a dandelion
And when my color suited you
You allowed me to grow
But you know when you know
And now the party's over
And you're dancin' alone
You've been spinnin' 'round for hours
And the band have all gone home

And you're fantasizin'
You're takin' us for granted
I know you're bored
You always say I'm heavy handed
You got a beautiful mind
And a soul of a coyote
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad
Throwin' good after bad
Hunger drivin' you mad

Ooh, ooh, ooh
