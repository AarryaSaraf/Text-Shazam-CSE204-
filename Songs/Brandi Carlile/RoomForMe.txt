Album: RoomForMe

// 5:00 //

Monday you just had to spend the day with me
And hop a bus down to the big city
Tuesday it looked like rain
And i was laughing all insane 
And running through it anyway
Hot cup of coffee in my fingers 
As the weekend they disappear
Bye bye

Wednesday's paper is all about the president
We've all seen better ways of our time spent
Thursday it was nothing but a compropmise
Changing with the tide is just my way of being wise
Naive notions that were childish
And my thoughts of a busy day
Maybe

You know i worked all day then the sun went down at five
I'll pass the hours away just to keep myself alive
Yeah i didn't miss you a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right

Friday comes my song is on the radio
A long drive home and i'm listening to my indigo
Solitary sense it finally comes over me
I made it through another week
I know just where i want to be 
Raindrops on the window wash away my Friday blues

You know i worked all day then the sun went down at five
I passed the hours away just to keep myself alive
Yeah i didn't miss yo a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right
We're all right now

Yeah i didnt miss you a bit but i just might want you tonight
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be there

Monday you just had to spend the day with me
Tuesday it's raining in the big city
Wednesday's the president Thursday i pay the rent
Friday comes my song is on the radio

Yeah i worked all day then the sun went down at five
I'll pass the hours away just to keep myself alive
Yeah i didn't miss you a bit but i just might want you tonight yeah
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right
We're all right
I'll wake up Saturday morning and finally i'll be all right

// Fall //

There's a candle in the corner
It keeps reminding me of you
It's how you lit it on my birthday
Sometimes I miss the things you do
But then you'd turn on me if the wind blew
And you'd sting me with a glare
And your thirst was so insatiable
Just to quench it robbed me bare

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees

Cross-legged by the fireplace
I play guitar while you read
My patience ran so thin with you
Always toying with my head
Some how it made you strangely gleeful
To see me longing for your touch
And I still fail to see the humor in my loving you so much

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees

I said we're faced with the facts and it's a high price to pay
C'mon blue eyes that tell me you can't walk away
If there's nothing to lose then there's nothing to gain
C'mon stay here tonight don't drive home in the rain
And I fall on my knees
All my pride is in your hands
We're not so strong and we've mislaid our plans
I taste the shame and I'll take the blame
If it's my cross to bear

I'm on broken glass
My bitter pill
That you'll love me I know
I been wasting time on climbing hills
So you'll love me I know
Someday you will.........fall on my knees
