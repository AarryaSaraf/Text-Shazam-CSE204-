Album: GiveUpTheGhost

// Caroline //

I woke up long after dawn
20 years had come and gone
I know when it changed for me
A day in June you came to me
I've seen through someone else's eyes
With nothin' on the other side
Every motel, every town
Pieces scattered all around

Promises that I can't be
Someone's heart that I can't keep
Days so long I couldn't speak
Roads so rocky I can't sleep
But I've seen things so beautiful
All around this broken world
That pale in comparison to you

Caroline I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through 
without you by my side
It's been a long long time
Oh won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always  on my mind

I have seen the canyon lands
Crooked lines like in your hands
You'd swear the earth was split in two
I wouldn't lie I promise you
That I have seen it, you will too
You could not believe if not for 
photographs I took for you, Caroline
They've built towers to the sky
It hurts sometimes to watch them try
They run themselves into the ground
But I know you will love them 
and their city lights and city sounds
There's beauty in the struggle
Anytime I feel it get me down
I see you smiling

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long long time
Oh won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind
My Caroline

Now I have seen things in the sky
Stars and lights and birds and I
I've been rocky mountain high
And told them all about you
Because you are still the only thing
That constantly amazes me
I love the road and I've been blessed
But I love you best

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long long time
Oh won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind
You were always on my mind
My Caroline

// Looking Out //

I went out looking for the answers and never left my town.

I'm no good at understanding, but I'm good at standing ground.
And when I asked a corner preacher I couldn't hear him for my
youth. Some people get religion some people get the truth. I
never get the truth, I never get the truth.

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I lay this suitcase on my chest so I can feel somebody's weight.
And I lay you to rest just to feel a give and take?
I got a new interpretation and it's a better point of view, you
were looking for a landslide I was looking out for you, I was
looking out for you, someone's looking out for you

I know the darkness pulls on you. And it's just a point of view
When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and when
you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like your
heart can break in two, someone loves you.

I am afraid of crossing lines. I am afraid of flying blind.
Afraid of inquiring minds. Afraid of being left behind.

I close my eyes I think of you, I take a step I think of you,
I catch my breath I think of you, I cannot rest I think of you

My one and only wrecking ball, and you're crashing through my
walls. When you're outside looking in you belong to someone and
when you feel like giving in and the coming of the end, like
your heart could break in two, someone loves you.

// Dying Day //

I left home a long long time ago
In a tin can for the road
With a suitcase and some songs
Chasing miles through the night time
Making tracks with no time for looking back
To the place where I belong

How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long

When your sad you know I wish I could be there
To make your sorrows disappear
And set your troubles free
It's not fair for me to be this far from you
But I promise to stay true, wherever I might be

Time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long

Now I'm lost in a sea of sunken dreams
While the sound of drunken screams echos in the night
But I know all of this will come to pass
And I'll be with you at last forever by your side

How these days grow long
But I'm on my way back home
It's been hard to be away
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day

Time keeps burning
The wheels keep on turning
Sometimes I feel I'm wasting my days
How I miss you and I just want to kiss you
And I'm gonna love you till my dying day
How these days grow long
Time keeps burning on
How these days grow long

// Pride And Joy //

Time of day I can't recall,
The kind of thing that takes its toll.
Over years and over time,
Over smiles and over wine.
All in all it wasn't bad,
All in all it wasn't good,
But I still care.

That's the problem with the days
They're never long enough to say,
What it is you never said,
All the books you never read.
I throw myself into the wind
Hoping somebody might pick me up
And carry me again.

Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?

I believe this to be true
There's nothing sacred, nothing new.
No one tells you when its time.
There are no warnings, only signs.
Then you know that you're alone,
You're not a child anymore,
But you're still scared.

All your mountains turn to rocks.
All your oceans turn to drops.
They are nothing like you thought;
You can't be something you are not.
Life is not a looking glass.
Don't get tangled in your past,
Like I am learning not to.

Where are you now?
Do you let me down?
Do you make me grieve for you?
Do I make you proud?
Do you get me now?
Am I your pride and joy?

// Dreams //

Dreams, I have dreams
When I'm awake when I'm asleep
And you, you are in my dreams
You're underneath my skin,
How am I so weak

And now in my dreams,
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams

How long, can you hold your breath?
Can you count to ten, can you let it pass?
Keep, can you keep it in?
Keep it behind latches, can you make it last?

And now in my dreams,
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
Oh, and I have dreams, I have dreams

Mind, can you read my mind?
Has it come undone, am I showing signs?

And now, in my dreams
I can feel the way, I can just come clean
I keep it to myself, I know what it means
I can't have you, but I have dreams
I have dreams, I have, I have, I have dreams

// That Year //

I must have been sleeping
I must have been drinking
I haven't been dreaming about you for years
There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
I was too cool for high school that year

It must have been New Years
No one invited you
You took things too far
But I missed you
And your antics
You were lonesome
And blue eyed
And so special to us

You should have taken a long break
Instead of a long drop from a high place
Ten years I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say it
You're my friend again

He said he forgave you
I said I hated you
He was the bigger man
I was sixteen
All the innocence
It took for
You to finally make your year book
That year
That year

You could have taken some time away
Instead of a long drop
Instead of a leap of faith
Ten years I never spoke your name
Now it feels good to say that
You're my friend again
You're my friend again

I was angry
I was a Baptist
I was a daughter
I was wrong

// Before It Breaks //

Around here, it's the hardest time of year
Waking up, the days are even gone
The collar of my coat
Lord help me, cannot help the cold
The raindrops sting my eyes
I keep them closed

But I'm feelin' no pain
I'm a little lonely and my quietest friend
Have I the moonlight? Have I let you in?
Say it ain't so, say I'm happy again

Say it's over, say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks

I'm all right. Don't I always seem to be?
Aren't I swinging on the stars?
Don't I wear them on my sleeve?
When you're looking for a crossroads
It happens every day
And whichever way you turn
I'm gonna turn the other way

Say it's over, say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Learn to let it bend before it breaks

Say it's over say I'm dreaming
Say I'm better than you left me
Say you're sorry, I can take it
Say you'll wait, say you won't
Say you love me, say you don't
I can make my own mistakes
Let it bend before it breaks

// I Will //

It's not the end of the world, it's not even over
But it will be soon I never learned my lesson
I just changed my tune and no one seems to notice
But you will, you will

It's no big deal
But the last thing I think of when I close my eyes
And the first thing on my mind when I arise
It is a day and you're not really in my life

You can try and you won't find it where you're looking
You can hold it till it's putty in your hands
And you can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
And I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will

You're not fooling me
I'm not the sort of girl that can't see reason
But it's nothing that a little bit of time won't heal
I know it don't come easy but I love you, I do

Coming clean
Means never closing curtains I just changed my scene
Oh but you know what I mean and I will learn throughout my life
To never believe what will have been

I can try and I wont find it where im looking
I can hold it till it's putty in my hands
You can't break a heart that wasn't even yours to break
You can never be there for me in the end
But I will do the right thing I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will

I don't think you ever learned a thing from me
But I'm sure that you want me to learn from you
And you've drawn heavy-handed lines around morality
About yourself and I don't share your point of view

It's about time to let you go and I thought it's time to let you know
And it has to be the one that you'd regret
I have to say that I'm proud to know you
And I'll never be the same because we met
You might not miss this I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will
I will, i will, i will
I will, i will, i will

// If There Was No You //

When I see myself I'm seeing you too
As long as I remember and I'm feeling like I knew
That my jokes aren't funny the truth isn't true
If there was no you

If you were my boat in the deep blue sea
I probably sink you down
I know I should have thanked you for carrying me
But for you I would happily drown

Out on your way the darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight I'm your man
When you need a friend you got my hand

And what i really mean what I'm trying hard to say
Is that I'm counting on you and you got me too
Our secrets aren't safe I'm singing out of tune
If there was no you, if there was no you

Out on your way darkest night the longest day
I know what to say to make you laugh
And nothing you could do
Could make me turn my back on you
When you're looking for a fight I'm your man
When you need a friend you got my hand
When you need a friend you got my hand
You got my hand

// Touching The Ground //

I swear when we touched I saw heaven in your eyes
Jewel studded clouds floating in your skies
Seas of blue and fields of green
Looking like you fell out of someone's dreams

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground

You could sing an army of angels to sleep
Songs that could cause the devil to weep
You hold me so sweet when the day is done
Enough to make you wonder where we all came from

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground

And out of those eyes I'm feeling rain
Bringing me misery and giving me pain
Curse these shackles that you put on me
Blessed be the day when you set me free

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground

// Oh Dear //

Oh dear out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if we're scared
Everyone is on their own

It's only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can know my pain
All alone you were sitting there
Folding pages for your paper chain

Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
Forever say goodbye (forever say goodbye)
Or well be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever(?)

Heart breaks mistakes
Catching up to me in old ways
I know of hard days
Had my share of lonely nights

Its only you that my heart desires
Only you alone can break my fall
I pace the floor and I wish for more
While you were dreaming with your paper dolls

Now you can cut me free (now you can cut me free)
So when it all unfolds (so when it all unfolds)
We'll be holding hands and go on
Together you and I forever(?)

Poor dear out here
Everybody stumbles on fear
Who cares if you're scared
Everyone is on their own

Oh dear.
