// To End The Rapture //

The wind of life and air from above smells of death
Angels sing of the end
Nothing you say and nothing you try can change time
Human race prepares to die

// Turn The Other Way //

Slit my wrists, take away the pain
Slit my throat, there's no one to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion
Restless nights, they're not far away
Away, what
I came here for something and I'm not turning back
Strong piece of mind but you still hold my keys
Keeping my fate deep within your threshold
Petty inconvenience but it means the world to me

You hold the power
To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death

I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart, handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

You made me this way
I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, right now
Now you turn the other way

You've turned away from me
The future's much too far away to see
I hope you learn the truth
Not the way things were meant to be with me and you

// Darkness Surrounding //

Darkness coats us
The smell of fall
Changing season
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path
The chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead
Imprisoned souls
Trapped for eternity

Black crows break the silence
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can't stop it
Just enjoy it
Open up your mind and you will feel it too
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to
You can feel the thoughts of the dead
Feeling the thoughts of the dead
True or false, it's still there, breaking me
True or false, taking me, breaking me

You can feel it tonight
The wood has rotted away
Take the time absorb it
Their time is slipping away
Statues carved by hand
Statues that resemble their faces
They still breathe
Come join us

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away

Smell the burning embers, time flickering away
Timeless but soon gone
Timeless but soon gone

And I can find myself, alone with just my thoughts
As time crumbles away
Time crumbles away

// The Art Of Subconscious Illusion //

[M. Shadows:]
A living nightmare
Asleep but still aware
The endless torture
The painless pleasure

I grasp myself
Trying to regain control
I experience and learn
In another faction of my mind
So confused
But everything makes perfect sense
Can't feel the pain
Emotional pain's so much deadlier
Lost, you've just been raped (Pain!)
Your friends can't help you
Why won't they help you?
Another reality

This can't be happening
Why is this happening?
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

[M. Shadows & Valary DiBenedetto:]
Trying hard to figure out what's done
I scramble but now I run
The images in my head
All the problems that I've been fed
All the problems that I've been fed
The problems in my head

Punching slowly, my mind can't change the speed
As my victims bleed
No matter what I do or how hard I try
Can't use my abilities, use my ability

Art of illusion

[M. Shadows:]
My razor sharp knife's edge (my razor sharp knife's edge)
Pierces my victim's body (pierces my victim's body)
But I (but I)
Cannot take their soul (cannot take their soul)
Punching through Jello (punching through Jello)
Stabbing, not killing (stabbing, not killing)
Disappointment (disappointment)
Discomfort (discomfort)

My razor sharp knife's edge
Pierces my victim's body
But I
Can't take their soul
Punching through Jello
Stabbing not killing
Disappointment
Discomfort

// We Come Out At Night //

Black and gray clouds willow in the balance as the sun falls
Rain plays a heart warming tune
On the pavement
Emotions stir
A feeling of warmness, compassion
I feel at home
Disguised by surroundings
As the torn and left in the gutter seek vengeance
On their mistreated lives

The torn, left in the cold
Seek vengeance on mistreated lives
The torn, left in the cold
Seek vengeance
Mistreated lives

A silhouette stands still
A darkness on a warm summer night
But the rain falls cold
And the moon shines bright

Black as night
Cold as ice
Warm as home
Ready to live
Stars they shoot
In a clear
Across the sky
As does my time
Waiting, wanting, feeling emotion
Crying, breaking, loving nothing

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Breaking down, breaking away from me
Falling down, breaking away from me
Fuck

I need
This place
To get away from you

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

Clouds swallow the moon
And I'm alone
Thinking good times
And why'd they go?

// Lips Of Deceit //

The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste, losing control
I bleed in pain testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit, pull me from here

No one's innocent, so why do I feel bad?
But guilt keeps creeping, creeping up on me
Up on me
Guilt, tearing me up inside
The innocent, an evil in disguise
The face of beauty to fall for
I fall to my knees, deceitful
Brought down by feelings of regret
Again your mind has failed the test
Not everyone feels the same
Pacifist blinded by the game
Stand tall, they'll break your heart
Stand tall, they'll smash your ego
Stand tall, they'll tear you down
Stand tall, scar your soul
Break your thought, fuck your mind

The mark I breathe on you
It's burning through your soul
The breath I waste, losing control
I bleed in pain testing what I know
Lips soaked in deceit, pull me from this hole

// Warmness On The Soul //

Your hazel-green tint eyes watching every move I make
And that feeling of doubt, it's erased
I'll never feel alone again with you by my side
You're the one and in you I confide more

And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be

I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you

And we have gone through good and bad times
But your unconditional love was always on my mind
You've been there from the start for me
And your love's always been true as can be

I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you

I give my heart to you
I give my heart 'cause nothing
Can compare in this world to you

// An Epic Of Time Wasted //

So much time I've wasted
That I truly never thought it would really come to this
Never would I doubt you
But the truth kept smacking me in the face

Reality
You never stopped to think
And you ripped us apart
How could you?
Now our time is gone
But now it's breaking my heart

Tears run down as I think of the days we've had
And the memories will last forever
But you and I will die
And go our separate ways

You are the one
You are the wrong one
Breaking the mold
Going your own way, go

All I
Feel is
Betrayal
Betrayal

So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this
So much time I've wasted
And I never thought it'd come to this

We had something great
Then it was washed away
We had something more
Than I can explain
I'm sorry

(No) We had something great
Then it was washed away
(No) Not all friendships last
The genuine are harder to take
(No) Time to start again
I hope someday you'll think of me
(No) The end reality
I know someday I'll think of you

// Breaking Their Hold //

When you see them coming in form (coming in form)
And they say they do what's best for you (what's best for you)
Fighting for one total control (total control)
They are planned and organized for you (for you)

Breaking their hold
Breaking their hold of control they strive
To keep you down, behind your back, the time has come, the end is near
It's when you sleep, so late at night, and in the light, getting prepared
It's not to help you, but help their cause, under one system, you won't exist
They are the few, with all the power
Our system screams, we can't let them tear our hearts out
Screaming, pulling on our pride
Stand together for the right cause, one system to our demise

// Forgotten Faces //

Forgotten faces
Lost in yesterdays realm
Drained with confusion
Where did it all go?
Look into the past, look into their faces
Never, the thought of being time fucked
But now they're all gone and all that's left is this blank faced picture
Ninety percent, nothing was done, nothing accomplished
Coasting through life didn't seize the day
No one ever realized that they're already dead
By the time you realize, you'll be dead too
Without another chance to save the world
These things they're gone, you're gone, forgotten
Now your face in my picture frame. It's gone forever
Right before my very eyes
And just when I thought I made light of things
It slips away into darkness
My life passes now I see
Just what this world does hold for me
It's getting hard, harder to breathe
Am I out of time is that what this means?
Well that's what it means
That's what it means, you and me try to breathe
Now you realize
Your life flies by
Now I realize
My life, I die

// Thick And Thin //

I don't want to know
And I don't want to see you in this place
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face
And I don't want to hear anymore
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor

Get the fuck out of here now
Come on you kids, stand your ground
This is your show, it's your family
All of my friends there for me

There's four-hundred more of us than them
So kick them out
Keep it positive
Keep it real
Keep it true
Together with my friends
I'll be there for you

There's four-hundred more of us than them
So kick them out
Keep it positive
Keep it real
Keep it true
Together with my friends
I'll be there for you

Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through
This is to my brothers; I'll be there for you
Through the problems thick and thin and problems we'll fight through
This is to my family; I'll be there for you

I don't want to know
And I don't want to see you in this place
Your kind is a disgrace as I spit in your face
And I don't want to hear anymore
A friend is fucked with while he's having fun on the dance floor

// Streets //

You live your whole life staring at a wall
Your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids
The ones who go out and the ones who are taught to live
One group's taught how and the other group is taught why

There's no need to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see

No reason to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see!

Look what's happening now
What are the reasons why and how?
And don't you think it sounds stupid when someone's treated
Different 'cause they're not the same as me or you?

You live your whole life staring at a wall
Your mind goes blank sooner now you will fall
You never learned the things you say to know now, but how?
There seems to be a difference, two different types of kids
The ones who go out and the ones who are taught to live
One group's taught how and the other group is taught why

There's no need to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see

No reason to tell you what's in mind
But in the game of life I'm doing fine
No reason to tell you which way to be
The streets have opened my eyes to see!

// Shattered By Broken Dreams //

I see you fading away from us
I'll miss you very much
Room with empty bottles, broken dreams
And pride still running high, always on your side

But I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days

Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way

I don't want to leave you like this
We all tried to save you but missed
I still feel the hope on your road
Now come back to us like the days of the old

I still feel you there, trying to get on top
You'll always have my support, in my heart
People you've hurt
Friends that you've lied to
But we understand, and that's not you
Can't take the end of the road
I can see it now, for you
I'm scared, if I lose you, I'm not prepared
This time, if you die
I watch you, right before my eyes
Just trust me, and listen
You have no self control

This will take your life
(Will take your life)

Overdose and then indulge until you die
Wondering, we still ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad
And we are left the only family that you've ever had

Overdose and then indulge until you die
Wondering, we still ask the question why
Broken home, and then abandoned by your dad
And we are left the only family that you've ever had

I wanted more for you
You can't go on this way
And now I see it all fall through
We pray for better days

Stuck alone and scared
Throw your life away
And now choking on your pride
May be the only way

Help you see it through
Fight this for me and you
Reaching deep inside
Problems not just you is what we find
Our friendship makes it mine
