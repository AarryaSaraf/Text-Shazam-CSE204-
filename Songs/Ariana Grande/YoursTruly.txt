// Honeymoon Avenue //

[Ariana Grande (Leon Thomas III):]
(Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da)
(Shoo-doo-doo-dum-doo, da-da)
(Sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da)
(Da, da) Uh-huh
(Da, da) Ooh, yeah
(Da, da) Mm, ah
(Da, da) (It's the Rascals)

[Ariana Grande:]
I looked in my rear-view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it (Found it)
Well, that's when we start turnin' around (Turnin' around)
You're sayin', "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like we've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know, yeah
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in—
Traffic, I'm under
Pressure, pressure—
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue
Avenue
Let's just go back, b-b-b-back, back, back

[Big Sean:]
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent an hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doin' what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? (Got you, I got you)

[Ariana Grande:]
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally, the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine

You know what I need (Ayy)
I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh

You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (Right there)

You're so different, no one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there

About you, boy, you're on my mind (Oh)
Sometimes I catch myself daydreamin'
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time (Track of time)

You know what I need (Ayy)
I know what you like (Ayy)
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright (Alright, hey)
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?

And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there {What? Okay}
I'll always be right there (What?)

[Big Sean {Ariana Grande}:]
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? (What?)
If my Benz turned back to public transportation (Swerve, swerve)
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waitin' (What?)
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary (Ooh)
My black book of numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five-course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
{And I'll never let you go} (I got you)

[Ariana Grande {Big Sean}:]
You should know {Oh} I'm never gonna change (I'm never gonna change)
I'm always gonna stay (I'm always gonna stay) {Oh}
You call for me, I'm right there (I'm right there)
Right there (Ooh)

// Lovin' It //

It's The Rascals!
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love?

Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

See, what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doin', doin'

Nothin' but lovin' you
Nothin' but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time

When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you

My baby

// Piano //

Oh-whoa
Oh-whoa
Here we go

I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
It's not hard (It's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard (Real hard)
It's so hard (It's so hard)
Real hard (Real hard)
It's that hard (It's that hard)

But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get 'em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh

// You'll Never Know //

Now you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't get mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't, no, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

Now it's probably hard for you to hear
But there's nothing left for you to say
Had my heart all in your hands, boy, what you don't understand
Is a girl like me don't have no time to waste around

But if you woulda manned up, put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt, then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else, and he loves me
Too much for me to mess this up
But it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go

But you will never know (Oh-oh)
What we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown) (Oh-oh)
Your way back then
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know

You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know

It's not my fault
You're a little bit too late
You're the only one to blame
Wipe that look off your face
You can wish a thousand times
But none of that will change my mind, boy
You had a chance you'll never get back, get back, uh-uh

You will never know what we could have been
If you would've shown (If you would've shown, babe)
Your way back then (Way back then, baby)
Boy, you gotta (Yup, yup)
Boy, you shoulda (Yup, yup)
'Cause you didn't know, so
Now you'll never know (Oh, baby)

You'll never know
Boy, you should've told me, told me
You'll never know
Boy, you should've let me know
You'll never know
Boy, you could've been there for me
But now you'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know (You will never know, you will never know)
You'll never know (No)
You'll never know (You will never know)

// Almost Is Never Enough //

I'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right, but that's a lie, that's a lie

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve

Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost, baby, is never enough, baby
You know

And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show

'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows

Almost, almost is never enough (is never enough, babe)
We were so close to being in love (so close)
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you (babe)
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms

And we almost, we almost knew what love was (baby)
But almost is never enough

Oh, oh baby, you know, you know, baby
Almost is never enough baby
You know

[Ariana Grande (MIKA) {Both}:]
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popular-ish

You hid during classes and in-between them
{Dunk me in the toilets now it's you that cleans them}
(You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do)
(It ain't so funny when the joke's on you)
Ooh, the joke's on you
Got everyone laughing, {got everyone clapping, asking}
{How come you look so cool?}
{'Cause that's the only thing that I learned at school}, boy
(Uh huh, I said) {that's the only thing that I learned at school}

// Better Left Unsaid //

I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need you, I'll be alright."
But some things are better left unsaid

To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
I'm gonna say things like, "Shut up and kiss me!"
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons
That some things are better left unsaid

And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said

Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
I'm gonna say things like, "Shut up and kiss me!"
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh
Tonight I'll say things, don't play me, just kiss me, babe

If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up put your hands up

I could tell a lie, blame tonight
Too many drinks, so many reasons that some things are better left unsaid

// The Way (Spanglish Version) //

[Ariana Grande:]
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
Tú eres todo para mí
Te amo, I love it

[Mac Miller:]
Say, I'm thinkin' 'bout her, every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, picking petals off the flowers like "Do she love me? Do she love me not?"
I ain't a player I just

[Ariana Grande:]
You give me that kind of something, want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you and I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No sé vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no sé vivir (te amo, I love it)
The way I love you

Oh, estoy loca, no no no no puedo ya dejarte de pensar
Y tú me llevas hasta el cielo (el cielo) con tu modo de hablar
Dame un beso, mi amor, y acaríciame
Llévame al cielo, enamórame
Baby, yo quiero (estar contigo)
No te vayas, escucha lo que digo

So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No sé vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no sé vivir (te amo, I love it)
No sé vivir, no

[Mac Miller:]
I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feelin' lonely, so you're sleepin' in mine
Come and watch a movie with me "American Beauty" or "Bruce Almighty" that's groovy just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you I'm not gonna get bored of but baby, you're an adventure so let me come and explore ya

So don't you worry, te necesito
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
I love the way
I love the way
I love it, I love it
No sé vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no sé vivir (te amo, I love it)

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
No sé vivir (tú eres todo para mí) ooo no sé vivir (te amo, I love it)
The way I love you

The way I love you, you, you, yeah, the way
I love the way you make me feel (te amo, te amo)
I love the way you make me feel (te amo) no sé vivir
The way I love you
