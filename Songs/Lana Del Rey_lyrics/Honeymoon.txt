// Honeymoon //

We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car if we choose

Mr. Born-To-Lose

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you

Everything you do is elusive, too, even your honey dew

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

// Music To Watch Boys To //

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys

// Terrence Loves You //

You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
I'm putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom

Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

// God Knows I Tried //

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday they destroy me
But by Friday I'm revived

Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

And God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried

// High By The Beach //

High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end
(High-igh-igh-igh)

// Freak //

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

// Art Deco //

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
So we stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be free

// Burnt Norton (Interlude) //

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

// Religion //

Everything is fine now
Let sleeping dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind
Let the ocean wash away

It never was about the money or the drugs
For you, there's only love
For you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now
No more cloudy days
Even when the storms come
In thee, I will stay
No need to survive now
All we do is play
All I hear is music
Like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs
With you, there's only love
With you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

You're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

// Salvatore //

All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream

All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice creams

The summer's wild and I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your MedellÃ­n, tangerine dreams

Catch me if you can, working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao amore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Soft ice cream

// The Blackest Day //

Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
"I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on"
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

Carry me home, got my new coat and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listening to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again

// 24 //

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

// Swan Song //

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything

Nothing could stop
The two of us
Let's just get lost
That's what we want

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep and dive blue, my sweet
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away

But nothing could stop
The two of us
If that's what we want
We could just get lost

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Do you like?
Do you like where you've been and where you're going to?
(Going to)
Say goodnight
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm gonna follow you

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be free?

// Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood //

Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
