// Love //

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while cruising
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

// Lust For Life //

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
There's nobody here, just us together (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
Keeping me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

(Then) We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

// 13 Beaches //

I don't belong in the world
That's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally it's mine
With dripping peaches
I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby only then
Do I let myself recline?
Can I let go?
And let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally I'm fine
Past Ventura
And lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me
If you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies
Feeling hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

// Cherry //

Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feeling no fear
When you're standing in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven taking the place of something evil (Hey)
And letting it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love (Yeah), is it real love?
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Looking at me like a magazine)

My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Looking at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)

// White Mustang //

Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slipping on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feeling
The day your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightning

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said, you're a wild mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning

// Summer Bummer //

It's never too late
To be who you wanna be
(Swimming in my safe)
To say what you wanna say
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
And it's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave (Better not)
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby (Yeah)
I got a feeling in my bones
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
Can't get you out of my veins (Yeah, yeah)
You can't escape my affection (Yeah, yeah)
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)

Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you dating
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playing
Boo, let's get acquainted (What?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (Yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But banking like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hating (Yeah)
What? (What? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Bopping (What?)
Milly Rocking (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (Yeah that's girl; For real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (For real, for real)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (For real, for real)
Niggas better run for cover for real
Going bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real (For real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)

Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm (What? What? What? What? What?)

White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches

High tops in the summer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Babe)

// Groupie Love //

You're in the bar, playing guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, living it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swinging to the beat
When I know that you're doing it all for me

And every time you look up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Time after time, writing my lines
Having my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pouring you a drink
And pretending that nothing means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watching my bae
Side stage, fans screaming causing migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga acting irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die

Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

// In My Feelings //

I'm smoking while I'm running on my treadmill
But I'm coming up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm crying while I'm cumming
Making love while I'm making good money
Sobbing in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time
While you're taking what's mine with the things that you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

I'm smoking while I'm running
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughing as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm crying while I'm gunning
In the smoke they can hear me coming
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time while you're taking what's mine
Well, you know what you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

Got me up in this place right now
Making no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feeling so blue
Making no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

// Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind //

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it
'Cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next morning
They put out the warning
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music
Tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads
I said a prayer for a third time

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella, cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down with his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children
And all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today
Maybe my contribution
Could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

// God Bless America - And All The Beautiful Women In It //

Take me as I am
Take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
It's got me singing

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

Take me as I am
Don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe
I might be standing outside
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even walking alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free
It's got me thinking

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

(Sweetest melodies)
Even with you I've got no one to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear
It's got me thinking (yeah)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it

// When The World Was At War We Kept Dancing //

Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth

Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
We'll do it again

We'll do it again
In a world at war

Is it the end of an era?

// Beautiful People Beautiful Problems //

Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

But when I love him get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me
But is it wasted love?
(It's not wasted love)

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Yeah, we've gotta try (la la la)
We gotta walk through fire (la la la)

// Tomorrow Never Came //

"Hey, what you doing?" Not a lot
Shaking and moving at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Lay, lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Hey, what you thinking? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa

I could keep waiting for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came

// Heroin //

Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life, can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like MÃ¶tley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
How it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

Topanga is hot today
Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone
'Cause they still feel him here
I want to leave
I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like MÃ¶tley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

It's fucking hot, hot
Winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
It's hot, even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writing in blood on my walls and shit
Like
Oh, oh my God
Jumping off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me baby
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine
To take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I
Really changed
Baby

It's hot, hot
Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is
It makes my head get crazy
Oh, oh, oh
Makes me feel like I can change
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh
All of my evil ways and shit
Hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

// Change //

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in hotly and it's coming in strong

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a song
There's something in the water, I can taste it turning sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it

// Get Free //

Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doing it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discerning
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
