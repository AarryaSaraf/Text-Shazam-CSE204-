// Text Book //

I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
There we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Old Man River keeps rollin'
With or without him
Old Man River keeps rollin'
Without him, oh, my old man
Old Man River keeps rollin', oh

// Blue Banisters //

There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint

// Arcadia //

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel, with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Heyo, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

My body is a map of L.A
And my heart is like paper, I hate ya
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

They built me up three hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to ya
I'm leavin' them as I was, five foot eight
Western bound, plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for ya
But you'll need a miracle
America

// Black Bathing Suit //

Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's LA, "Hey" on Zoom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothin' to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?

I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad, and I'll show them what bad girls do

My black bathing suit
(Oh, let 'em talk about me)
They're just yesterday's news
(They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about them)
Mail me when you get the blues
(We'll have the last laugh about it)
By the way, thanks for the shoes (Haha)
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks out of it
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that

// If You Lie Down With Me //

Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants a dance, baby gets her way
Dreamy nights, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like six times 'till I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

// Beautiful //

Lets keep it simple, babe
Don't make me complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
He's interested, he's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't, and I'm glad about that

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into somethin' I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems either way it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be if you think that that's cool
Then I'll take you back

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

// Violets For Roses //

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the city
Like the Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha

There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the murder alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-la-ha, ah-ha)

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy

// Dealer //

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

I check it, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

555
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
9275, 555
Now you've got a busy tone
He won't pick up his phone
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
He ain't been home for years

// Thunder //

You roll like thunder
When you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same
Since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind
That's why you're visiting

You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like
When the party ends

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

You roll like thunder
Pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder
You're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle
That moonbeam in your hand

And you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
But you're not satisfied
At the rainbow's end

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin', 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)

// Wildflower Wildfire //

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal
What I can promise is I'll lie down
Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I'll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I'll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
You say there's gaps to fill in, so here
Here's the deal
My father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, and still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

And baby, I, I've been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns
Burn, burn, burn (Like the others, baby)
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn

// Nectar Of The Gods //

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins, and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

What sweet world is this? Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Californ-I-A, homeland of the Gods
Once I found my way but now I am lost

// Living Legend //

Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs but she knows I'm a monsoon

And baby you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what you never knew
What I never said, is you're my living legend

Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin-Ã© or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And darling I never meant to defy you

But baby you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend

I got guns in the summertime and horses too
Guns in the summertime and horses too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why

My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend

// Cherry Blossom //

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave
And very free

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave
And there's much to see

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

And when you're scared
I'll be right here
You feel afraid
Mommy is there
It's a cruel, cruel world
But we don't care
'Cause what we've got
We've got to share

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn
And so much to see

I push you high, Angelina, on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
