// Balance //

I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on

Watch the wall collide with my fist
Mostly over problems that I know I should fix
Focused so I know my skin tone is a cliff
We on the edge and they hopin' we slip
I had to ask moms what I owed in this shit, she said nothin'
She asked about them old times both of us miss, I said nothin'
She asked me if I'm smokin' again
I told her that I prolly gotta go in a bit

I've been tryna tell a different story
Find balance and I'm tippin' off
And tell grandma I be with her shortly
I won't panic when they send her for me
Cause I ain't got time for feelin' sorry
I gotta be on point when duty call
And I'm prolly the worst nigga to get involved with
These shoulders is not for you to sniffle on

// Death Whistles //

Started out tryna make a truce
Ended up back in mine off a 80, proof
Running wild got you thinking you could solve it
We could really use some time
Just to recollect and find out a thing or two
Check the weather, never mind I ain't in the mood
Eyes settled on a prize bitch, I'm in the loop
Strip vinyl, spliff fired up, I get to choose
Which titles my rivals could win or lose
Parachute through the fog, I wish for summer off
Spring fitted for the dark, my nigga in a long-sleeve
Dripping through it all, niggas know
Niggas know not to hit me, I don't get too many calls
This city shit go, it's a pity how a piggy did you dog
That's why swampman living in the bog, feeling like a tsar
Off-bred niggas on the spittle getting charred
Swear you can hear death whistle from afar
When the wind blow, feds want your info
Streets full of sink holes, sheets full of nymphos
Brains like a baseball, legs like some pencils
Head for the hills, cause I'm on your heels
Like a bloodhound trained to your scent
Show face when I get dope, nigga my face in the shit
Two cards, blackjack, both ace's, it's lit
Closed case on the mess that I made thugging
No trace of you since, I sin, no place to repent
Closed game but we win, motherfucker
Closed game, cold game

// Drop //

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know everyone has their own fucking version of this
But no one did it justice, so... here we go, uh

[Verse 1]
Tell your bitch to stop complainin' 'bout her achey tits
Her body is a temple, I don't give a fuck, I'm atheist
Make me stop, make me bitch, she mad because I taped the shit
And sent the tape to Ace and Taco hopes to fuckin' 'bate to it
Master, master, pretty bitch bash a black and white bitch
Mixed like she moo and chew grass or somethin'
I like the shit, I guess I kinda like my bitch
If she wasn't a dyke motorcyclist with Tyson lisp
Wolf Gang on that drive without a license shit
On that take Shake and Meka necks and fuckin' slice them shits
Oh how nice, now you wanna say you like the shit
Because you bruised up, your neck sliced, and I ain't icin' shit
Show me a rapper my age that say he nice as this
And I'll show you a faggot that says he hate Barbara Streisand flicks
Huh, me and Berman swervin' in the jeep
But I'm a nice guy in person, but a pervert in the sheets
And I'm magic with the words, murder Merlin over beats
Make the competition kiss the fuckin' curb and then they weep

[Hook]
And then they drop, ha-ha
Drop, bitch, drop, drop, drop (Drop, bitch)

[Verse 2]
Yo, the lambs get silenced and the fans get violent
Droppin' live grimey like the hands of Odd Tyler's
Fuckin' Awesome arsenal of wolves in the pack I travel in
The battle ram, rammin' 'em, rats get to tattlin'
Lynn swingin' axes at you antonyms of savages
And prayin' that it damages, your hobby's what my passion is
Fuck that faggot shit, my niggas on that savage shit
Fuckin' the game and shovin' daggers through the ass of it
I said, fuck that faggot shit, my niggas on that savage shit
Fuckin' the game and shovin' daggers through the ass of it
Movin' on to a Jessica, plannin' to make a mess of her
After a couple drinks and a session of anal sex with her
Like hey there intestines, my cock is erect next to ya
We the shit, like what you make, them niggas still ain't fresh as us

[Outro]
Eat a dick, bitch!

// Farm //

Yeah, nigga
Aye, Aye
I've been on the, I've been on the-

I've been on the run, that's why I go harder than you go
Plus I call 'em like I see 'em, maybe that's why I'm all alone
Product of the cold, but let me back up
The bitch back arched like a bow, yes sir
Leave her eyes, in between them thighs, wetter
I told you that I'm in it for the long stretcher
I thought I told you that I'm in it for the long stretch
Drunk off of liquor from the long neck bottle
Mama told me that her soul been hollow for the longest
I told her like I know those problems
But you gotta know that wallowing is chosen
I scraped my face off the bottom one time
Now mama son shine
Like the mother fucking blinds when they open
Ashes to Ashes, pray death kiss my opponent
Had scars on my fist when I rose it
Armed with intent to provoke in a moment
Not be nutrition for vultures
Armor too thick for the poking
Think before you approach me, bitch

It's 6 in the morning
You live 'round the corner
It's hard in the city, I'm falling, I'm sickened
The piggy's approaching, clicking the cuffs on the vultures
Chickens get split and get sold
Live or you donât
Do what you do for your family but most, handle yourself
Know your daddy got goals
Be a man and just focus
Get you a plan and you get your shit split like divorce
Only throw hands when you stuck in a jam
And they force it we can't afford no more losses
We all might work at the [?]
6 in the morning
The piggy approaching
Your window half open
You reaching the [?]
The world keep on spinning
You [?]
It get difficult not to get hopeless
It get difficult, it get diffcult

// Fuck Your Compression //

[Sample]
You'll still never know

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Sly's been first, man
Y'all forever last I'm forever everlastin'
Mashing on the gas bypassing all the has-beens
In that sense I'm that shit in that scents
Inhale it, breathe it, embrace it
Crepes is not as flat as you natives of fake is
So I take this and shine and provide illumination
But niggas stay in the dark and I'm startin' to get impatient
15 is the age of the teenager
Roamin' with a mind full of gold, no pager
A circle of squares is what shaped us
Until it's sussed feel free to hate us
Unchained, untamed, fast lanin', fat chainin'
Throw 'em on a playlist labeled as the greatest
Unleaded premium, large not medium
Say cheese, bitches bodies seize upon meeting us, man

[Verse 2: Gruzen]
This is what I do, I infect hope
And inspire folk by painting pictures with the better view
My soul is weather proof, my mind can shape shift
Divine greatness runs in bloodlines still ancient
Expansive universes embedded in ours
Reflected in stars, I shine with the breath in my heart
That's why my flows complete, it's flawed
Get raw energy, exposed for the whole globe to see
Yeah you know it's me, I'm back at it again
Elevating the bar, haters will never get in
This is a sacred place, where we embrace creation
Through landscape, shape and painted in a vacant space

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
They asked us to stop playing so rough outta courtesy
And if I were to stay in my lane, I swerve purposely
I spit fire, burns in the third degree
Every line is turpentine to these herb serpentines
Snakes in the grass, for all you dumbasses
Fair fax bastards, rockin' nerd glasses
I dominate, y'all denominate fractions
I relapse back to spittin' crack like chapped lips
Chasin' pavements 'til the day of amazin' payment
Success is the fragrance on my Bathin' Ape apron
Pull your face up out your anus and face this
Darth invade your playlist, you cannot evade this
Closed case, you're makeshift, I make hits
You make shit, you crave this, this greatness
You can't attain us like bad grades for Asians
I'm grade A list, lick the speaker, you could taste it

// Hat Trick //

Uh, uh
Give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we consider Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Get it, only thing certain was the taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, new sermon for the masses
We too purpose for the scrap
What the verdict read is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Grave, ooh, hoo, hoo, fuck it
Run me back, nigga (fuck it)
Yeah, that shit is hard, we gotta run it back (run me back, nigga)
Detroit, make some noise for human error

I said that
I give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Get it, only thing certain is these taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses
We too purpose for the scraps
What the verdict read, is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, might be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrified, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy, tied to the job
Based off principle, my energy
Printed with my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus
Though, it make no sense, I keep a heart on my shirt
When the rain storm's vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking
Trying to harvest the hurt, but it make no difference
God damn

// Home //

Self-loathing narcissist
Spittin' crowbars out the back window of cars and shit
And acting like a klonopin binge, hardening
And switching up the moniker of artists into arsonists

Knock-knock, it's that prodigal pen-throttle, bitch
Popping like the top of a bottle of hot JavaScript
Rhyme harder than nine joggers with
Shin splints dodging an ornery rhinoceros

Order me my waffles and bother me not, blogger
The option of being modest just walked to where my father went
Ponder how we can holler then spit darker
Than Gotham at six bars in the genre then lick shots

At imposters and miss nada, Volatile pig brawler
Is hotter than lit parliament singeing your fucking arm
In the parking lot of a Target, I'm targeted, piss-harboring
Heart dark as that thick parka I slip markers in

Holla if you've never been a starter
Spartan kicking jocks and tossing salt at their Ed Hardy shit
Burning chops, talking shit, rocking 28's on a rocket ship
So I could give a fuck about the car you in, nigga

Drool and chew aluminum
Blue 'Preme overalls, jump when the Goombas come
Some of you should run from where the shooters come
Out for cheese with a studio, it's like a gouda run, it glues to us

Shouts to pigeons that I flew amongst
Mouth deliver poop, it's spouting mucus from its stupid tongue
Alpha male, got the chickens looser than his cruising trucks
Losers get a Kuma Punch, I'm moving like a puma's lunch (Thanks James)

And I'm... back... bye

// Mezmorized //

Yo

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

Yeah, yeah
Look love, I'm mesmerized by you
Saw a little dimple and I knew I had to try you in the book of love
My name's is right next by you and I knew it was meant to be
And I see you're into me
I tag "love" on the wall, was 12/1/08
With the heart and all in the bathroom stall, the rebel type
On the first flight to the Moon, that's where we should go
Just love a little lust, God please forgive me
While he hits me, look at her hips and lips, B
Beautiful like the sunset we
Together and, we see, the Sun
But we just have to run, yeah
Her voice harmonies to my life
Once I hear, everything is, um, balanced and nice
She's like ice on a summer day
She makes me think of when to stray
She's the reason I'm having a great day
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Creep on the street, that's my everything
But I gotta stop when you trap my ways
Nigga slide though

"Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn
Then paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in, thought jumped in my head
School was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (She's gorgeous)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs (She's gorgeous)
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

// Molliwopped //

Let's be honest cause truthfully
At the rate I'm moving, you gonna to have to get used to me
This sauce is the weakest, tang and my three step
Often rejected cause I reject the reject
Garage band flow needs no reasoning
Y'all niggas tasteless, beef no seasoning
C4's eating them proceed to the exit
Ends with a L-Y, starts with a S, yes
Him without a winner is Clark Kent without a cleft chin
Superman reference of how high I keep stepping
Whoa, I go harder than standardized testing
Bars on lock my developments arrested
I'm the bestest, on a bad day I spit asbestos
Yeah, yes, impressive y'all steady coming in second
Fuck V-necks I'm the rapper to invest in
My flow ends recessions, I'm fresh as Crest breath is
Kay, I'm tryna tell you I'm superior
Cardiac flow what you're hearing in my material is heart
Covered in ego, I freeze MCs zero degrees below
When it's comes to alter-ego's, I got at least four
But they the reason I'm always ready, listo
Aight I'm Sly-lingual, eyes on the prize, I'm fly make eyes twinkle
I been dope, put it on your grandmother's wrinkles
Chip on my shoulder like I'm dieting with Pringles
I brush it off quick like H to the O-V
Life is but a beach chair these nigga's folding

// Warlord Leather //

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Dipped and writ his own ransom
Chest full of spliffs told the bitch it was cancer
Hit the road for some months
For the fan in the front row, getting punched out
Screaming "Whoa" with his hands up
The glorious bastard is back
In that hoodie like a vein that collapsed cause it's black
Sittin' shotty in the Mazda, pack cover lap and his
His daddy like an answer, 'cause he never had one
Eyes all low on account of what the grass done
Higher than the Masten
Five star telly, nice belly on the bad one
Heavy with the raps way cause a nigga chip em out
Be really what attract the bitches
Switchin' brackets with the taxes never actin' different
Boney nigga think he's thin, kind of baggy
With some niggas that be trappin', shippin' packages;
Their cake is up
Got my mama tripping like she jogging and her ankles touch
Now I'm at the Waldorf stressin'
Fidget with the zipper on the warlord leather
Whisky with the spliff, because it goes more better
Why bench him if he's scoring under full court pressure

[Action Bronson:]
(Coughing)
Put me in coach
Put me in coach
I got this man I'm on fire tonight
Telling you
Uh

Your bitch pussy smells like Sway's hat
I'm like Swayze mixed with Sajak, in a straight jacket
Aim the iron at your facial bracket
You can't escape great magic
My mind make the fishes swim in strange patterns
Drift in the beige Satin
Switchblades, new face, get the face tatted
Inside my lungs look shattered
Hanging backwards off a ladder
EBT card got my baby momma face on it
Big checks with my name on it, put my name on it
My face is on the pen, cause I'm a G
Looking for some other shit, send 'em down the street
Can't even compute on how much I spent on then retreat
I spent up about a eleven thousand Yen just on the feet
Another twenty seven thousand Yen just for the heat
Play the guitar with my teeth (Yeyeyeye-ya)
Coach called him off the bench, told his ass to sit down
Motherfucker you were picked up in the sixth round
Throw him in the tub that's filled with hot sauce
I'm laid back, gettin' sucked, eatin' nachos

[Outro:]
You know it's me motherfucker
You know it's me
And it's me again
Dinosaur legs in the building
Yo, Gary! turn that shit up, I can't hear it motherfucker
