// 74 //

You like Amar'e Stoudemire with dreads
Bobbleheads, chatterboxes flappin' but I got a lot 'em fed
Common head cold-level, minor setbacks, minor threats
To blockin' it's kinda Steph, step back
Ya shit is not knockin' like the feds
Don't get your head cracked lackin' common sense
On a whim I felt it, in mi casa you don't got no wins
Just to match the losses I don't have in your gym
Opposites attract opulence, the mud wouldn't stick
The sun make it so my soul's crumblin'
They dug it when they was young
More than one hole in one with no mulligan
Sellin' kids culture with death, circlin' like carrion
The more the merrier, phone got you livin' vicarious
I smell it 'cause it's so hot
The veil lifts, the pain salient
Niggas started choppin' at the road blocks
As far as tracks, we goin' off
Brought the stroganoff beef, holy war
You know it's not unique to your boy at all
It's comin' out the teeth
Streets flooded like the pants weren't touchin' the sneak
They rain dancin' on this, no, they stomp
On all accounts, paid the cost to see this far
I'm not on board with the board you try and lead me on
I'm pullin' strings, it's time to let me off
The cook'll send you
Protect your neck and don't forget the heart
We upper echelon with it, that's what they're checkin' for
I'm givin' a fed a conch for them
I'm duckin' when the quiver launch missiles in the dark
Miss me with the glib remarks, switch hitta
Keep the innings long, nigga

// EAST //

Double back when you got it made
30 racks of weed, no fat in the collard greens
Off top was me - no cap, I don't bottle things
Flashin' grandmama rings on her fingers
I'm fond of them things
Father, we gleam
I'm ominous of James Harden-D
Weak niggas guardin' will peak
Followers just like me
I lost my phone and consequently
All the feelings I caught for my GF
My hands was on the wings
I took 'em off, not a story
Careen against the bars
My canteen was full of the poison I need
The trip as long as steep
My innocence was lost in the East
Amidst the thick exhaust
Hockey, hit the heart - it beat
Mention my sin is strong
We all that we need
But don't call me brother no more
I keep my sentences short
Stack Pendleton keep me warm in the winter
Ksubi's cuff done hit the floor
Doobie Brothers where the city morgue
Who would truly love a visit from us?
My soul and my heart
All in it, keep fishing
Gone, the macabre finish
And miss my Pop dukes, might just hit me
Depending how I play my cards
The wind whispered to me, "Ain't it hard?"
I wait to be the light shimmering from a star
Cognitive dissonance shining and the necessary venom restored
As if it matters if you think it matters anymore
Cause shit be happening with quick results
They couldn't fathom all the damage that had to get done
Pig was in a barrel, we cookin' up
Don't get a sparrow, no harrowed runics in that damn tomb
And a share of deadly flowers bloom
Holler rabidly, we stare at you
And say a prayer
Let's take it there like carrier pigeon
50,000 roots, none of them rigid
Some of them wicked, how they grew

// MTOMB //

So, so we, so we did it?
Yeah, yeah

Pray for the people
I make up the easel first, then paint what I see through
The maze, I'm an eagle, spend a day up at the creek
We got the same amount of heat too, but they not as regal
CruditÃ©s not gon' cut it, cut it slight
Braids brought out my eyes
I saw a light, I was nine
Told my nigga Miles we might gon' be aight
Guess I was right, twenty-five was a quarter to life
I'm on it, I strike, trials
Trick knowledge you fond of, I don't even like
The socialite reformed, alone every night
Post-performance, dizzy in the corner, boy, it wasn't nice
Learnin' how to get grimy
Pick a pole to grab and flip
Ho, we gon' shake something now
I got some time this year
I'ma go ten rounds and dip out, what time is it?
Mommy water, shawty blew the fish out
Piscean just like my father, still got bones to pick out
For now let's salt the rims and pour a drink out
And sip (Mmh)

// OD //

Give it up, we...

Somebody tooted in the student commence?
The bell rang, he went home to argued in the comments
I watched the doppler move, I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point, my noose is golden
Truer living lonesome
Pugilistic moments
Riveting, come get to know me
At my innermost my family been this anguished misanguished now I need atonement
I set the goal, half my wings is broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing too much love
My sister showed in a rut
We getting over sinning up
Living in the moment, you been corrupt
Have some gin and rum
Since a jit I figured what's the use in giving up
I can't give enough
Shilajit in my sippy cup
Healing cuts, but really-ly I'm re-filling the pump no concealing it
The Enemy up in arms bearing snubs they just break to see the cup
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck
Pieces in slums, one
Peaking in the dust, weaving
I remember woods
I remember in the, when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love healing the ruptures
Feeling rushed, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th, give it up
Gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit

[Mavi:]
Tryna, tryna
Tryna

Man, lost my dog in staircase
Took the highest spot on the podium
Ghost niggas prolly smokin' to the thought of knowin' us
They lost a part of growin' up
Smartest, learned I had to keep a wedge to get out of the rough
Use the clips, ain't used to disrespect, 'cause we carried enough
I promise I buried the grudge, preparing and carrying grub
Larry Hoops, I was lost in the alley
In the air, but now I sunk
I spun to the loss of my grandmama, buried the dunk
Send 'bout a prayer a month, through the above
Niggas moody but they view at the funk
Ain't shit to do, they play with food, they rhyme and Rubik's for fun
But I do what I want, ayy
And I rue what it was later, allude it as such
Confusedly up with paper, I'm shootin' ones with the judges
The same as my brother been with a muzzle, that's from the cradle
So we goin' to the grave with this shit
If we join the second line of ancestors and hand us a drum, loaded, a second time
Somethin' scary 'bout airin' out the shit I compress
The fair game, the fair now, the causes
An arm, leg, an arm, leg, and a head
And all greater conquest that takes our partner to rest
My partner, my partner spawned with a nigga red
I'm all on they neck, 'till my car parks, pardon it, fresh
Smart with a few niggas, sparkin' that large percentages
Was all to the wind, the losses come as often as wins
And impossibly thick
Don't got a job, I only ball off pick-six
I ball with fresh niggas, Lowry had shit lit, it's Christmas
I only know six niggas been lyin', but we ain't gon' mention
Who in the stu' and started sweating', told 'em, "It's the kitchen"
You know the rules, and we know how to shoot the loopholes
Who go boop-a-loop, and my kid, though got the kid
And you gon' juug a boogaloo
I been spittin' to rhyme the answer, not definitive, I just cramped it
I was gifted with words, oh damn, I took my lumps, my bruises, moved
What the fuck are you to do?

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'
Harry Potter with the Dub-D's
Magic hands, nigga, what cheese
Had a chance, then it crushed me
We gon' get it by all means
Rest in piece to my rocks, G
Raw fruit in the box, seeds
Let go, then I got wings
I'm seein' red, I'ma charge
You seein' red 'cause you salty
I keep the tears out my mind, reach
I put my fears in a box, like a prayer that you won't read
Spirited Away, the whole thing
Tearin' away, I won't leave
See you starin' into old beefs
Ticket booths, where they told me
Thickest thorns on the roses
Pistons roarin' like I'm Rasheed
Pistons roarin' like I'm Ben Wallace
Pistons roarin' like Chauncey
Billups, somethin', 'cause I been drivin'
Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'

// TISK TISK / COOKIES //

["TISK TISK"]

Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch, snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga
Shit
Fuck, nigga
Promise I'll never forget
And I promise I knew what it is
When I knew you, you wasn't a snitch
Tisk-tisk, nigga

["COOKIES"]

Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

I need cash money, baby, we live
I remember they ain't save me a slot
Back up when niggas hit the jackpot
I got sense, I'm tryna get me some guap
I need the tint
Just like my daddy skin, dark
I see your nigga, too bad he a mark
I see real niggas just jab, they don't bark
I see you tryna rekindle the spark
Reelin' from loss, yeah
Inner remorse, divorce your spirit and corpse, corpse
I tell you I'm hearing it all
The wisdom that's in your remarks
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em lost
The silliness in you, I mourn
The moments that's tender and soft
I'm in 'em, the memories got strong
But some of 'em long gone

Run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time
Run for your, run for your life
I took the cookies, put 'em to the side
Sunny day, but I'm cooking inside
Muddy path, but I'm taking my time

[Mach-Hommy:]
Uh-huh
Send me the invoice for all that shit
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread
Send me the invoice
Send me the invoice for all that shit
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread
Send me the invoice
Send me the invoice for all that shit
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread
Send me the invoice
Send me the invoice for all that shit
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread
Send me the invoice
Send me the invoice for all that shit
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread
Send me the invoice
Send me the invoice for all that shit (Uh-huh)
Bet we can pinpoint all that shit
Then we can enjoy all that bread (My nigga)
Send me the invoice (Okay)

Too much bread, bread, not enough bread
Too much 77, not enough 7
Too much Evanescence wake you up inside with a Wesson
Too much dereliction, nosedives for the reppin'
Shoot a Mac .11, take a vote ridin' on the jet
And do a chapter 7, chapter 11
Session for session, foot in your ass like lederhosen
Suppose that, allegedly, I was chosen to keep your speakers broken
Allegedly bespoke and smokin' we keep the beacon glowin'
Said I know, hand, leg, hangin' in the window
Arrested Development Mr. Window
Surreptitious niggas would miss a info
Kicko, blicko, sicko
Or catch me at no awards ceremony, perish the hegemony, horse feathers homie
Delicatessen hoagie, pressure on me, never lonely
Tenderonie, skeleton extra boney
Never phony, relish the testimony

And I began to riot

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Bend we don't break, swing we don't miss
We just might might be okay, the same voltage
Hold the charge like the phone lit
No regards for the bullshit
Who all in? who got the cards flipped?
Who on shit, who get the target split
Who on your marksman's bad side
Going in landmines, don't count steps
The old chest said it's about time
Slow breathe, cold flesh made her mouth cry
We know death, alright let's go left
Hand signs, still with the bands like lead singers
Niggas remember them camp fires
I dip when they capsize
And swift hit the roads kickin' cans like chivalry dead
You really dead, but we still ahead
Couple clips left, couple lips cleft
Hammer and nail, Hommy and Earl
Spotting, got 'em from the top of the hill
Wrote it on the foggiest mirror
The quality thorough, ill
It's all I could spill
There's more I could do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

// GHOST //

True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pre the plot, you never seen the ghost
Uh, uh, seen the ghost

Know four years later, know I got better
Praise to my God, that armor all metal
Iron sword, know my spirits gon' get on, huh
I know my pops guilty 'cause he left 'em
I wore his blessings, honorary cloak
And sacred Yoruba is what he spoke
I pray I say goodbye but know I won't
At best, uh
'Cause if he live, he'd be a vegetable
Know he next to go
Had to show love, we had grown apart
Can't dwell on what it was
Singing from my heart Paloma is a dove

Nah, true indeed, you never see the scope
Every which way the ouija go
Really nothing niggas ain't seen before
True indeed, true indeed, uh

True indeed, I see you creeping
Oh, what else you need to know?
Truancy was when I left, when I was needed most
Gold noose, I learned to see the ropes
I need a spot where I can see the coast
Nah, we the light, I keep my demons close
Nah, pre the plot, you never seen the ghost
Uh, uh, seen the ghost

// WHOLE WORLD //

[Maxo:]
Runnin' after shit, I think I want to double back
Devil hittin' my peripherals, start laughin' (Yeah)
Goin' off of what I know, and wanna see from that
Growin' up I know I changed, know that things happen
Look a man in his face
Dreads in the way and on his chains
Gold ride it in a day, forgot his name
But he told me, "Never change," we parted ways
I had to face with the man in the mirror since
Grew complacent with the human that I was
Angels sittin' on my door, had to recognize
All the feelings I disguise, it's there when I bleed
Eyes to my feet, can't stand when I see

The world around me, steady crumblin' (Crumblin')
The world around me
The world around me, steady
The world around me

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Made a home outta house, lotta closet room
Bones stackin' like dominoes
Catacombs, after the glow, the battle carry on
Get all that malice out your soul, the efficacy strong
I finish what I start, the funeral was hella long
I fell asleep, the effigy was short
My effervescence lost, but not entirely, I shrug the venom off
You kept a tiny peace for times we in the war
I like to think of life as deep, chilly water
We in it, feelin' warm, swimmin' upstream
Fuck is niggas on?
Icicles hangin' at my heart, cagey, estrayed, stay away
I hate to say they made me a dawg
Anxious, movin' at a pall bearer's pace
My family flame in the rain
Enemy of the state, fuck a allegation
Caskets and crattles to the grave and back again
Thanks to the source of the creation
And match fixed like a batch of fresh lemonade
They still couldn't fade us
How much shrapnel can your soul take?
The visions wasn't shabby at and angle
A phantom facin' a hallway, incarnations
Angels are coordinated with the fifth to the floor
Let's go half on a baby, I'm just playin' a course
I'm just sayin', maybe, later on

[Maxo:]
I got the, whole world round me
Whole world round me crumblin' in my vision
Whole world round me
I got the whole world round me crumblin'
I just standin' in my pivot
Whole world
Whole world round me
Whole world round me
Whole world round me
Whole world, whole world round me crumblin'
