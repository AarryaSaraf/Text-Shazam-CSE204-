// ThisNiggaUgly //

[ThatNiggaTaj]
Goddamn!!

[Intro: Taco and Tyler]
What up Tyler? (What up nigga? Hanging out)
What're you looking at? (Nigga, shit, fucking shit)
Let me see, who the fuck is this? (That dude? Oh, this dude?)
Look at his forehead

[Verse: Tyler the Creator]
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento
But this faggot just visiting, he's settling in
He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do
(Does he skate?) Yeah, he skate too
(Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member
And he.. (What's his name?) Earl

[Outro: Taco and Tyler]
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fucking big
This nigga, look at this fucking nigga's lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo, this nigga's line is bended! (That's fucked up)
Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet (Earl, say something)
Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fucking big ass nooch
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say something, trust me guys, he can rap)
He a bitch! (Just say something
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say something)
Nigga, rap, you fucking suck probably
(Trust me guys, he can rap, just say something)

// Earl //

Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut crashin' while
Jackin' off to bufferin' vids of Asher Roth eatin' apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets and laugh it off
Twisted sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screamin', bitch: you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin"
Puts the pieces of decomposin' bodies in plastic
Puts 'em in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fuckin' cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, you dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, askin' where her ass go
In my room, redefinin' the meanin' of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's OF buttercup: go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade a thong, my dick is havin' guts for lunch
As well as supper; then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard, fuckin' nosey neighbors notice somethings up
"What you doin'?" Nothin' much, squish out some other stuff
Gotta fuckin' bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

[Verse 2]
Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hatin' but them faggots is a lotta talk
Cotton soft pussy them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails, fuckin' toss one in your apartment dog
Wolf Gang we ain't barkin', nah
Try talkin' on a blog with your fuckin' arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter "We're sorry, but papa's gone... bitch"

// Couch //

[Verse 1: Earl]
Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But something was always missing like six digits
Lucky seven probably poppa
Little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so
David hit the pavement with his grapple rap
Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am popping like a snapping crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milking cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezing, boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split
Don't act surprised, agree with it
The Gang of Wolves and creeps and Crips
Is deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boasting
Bragging tell this faggots to stop nagging
Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it.. Troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirting with Uncle Mervin
Fucking y'all with no lubricant go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearing nothing but they fucking blast with their matching turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swerving
Hitting curbs and blasting Erick Sermon drunk off English Bourbon
I'm stealing purses raping nurses I'm a quick consierge
And treat the beat like sanitized nazi pussies, I'm a German
I'm squirting while I'm masturbating and regurgitating
From eating Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were serving
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like it's convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fucking ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang like they're filming Twilight in this bitch

[Verse 3: Earl]
I'm back on my sixty six six shit
Flowing like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers now you ain't laughing, huh

[Verse 4: Tyler]
Bitch you're barely breathing leaving on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowing like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed of her arm and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fucking awesome spitting box of trees, got you niggas
Shaking like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironing you niggas now it's time to start some shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl lying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out, sharpen it
Stab him, put a arch on it, pour unleaded gas on him
Get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it

// Kill //

[Intro]
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see

[Verse 1]
Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents, since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nod on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the Couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

[Hook]
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em

[Verse 2]
Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo, switchblade and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick

// Luper //

[Verse 1]
Ma said "Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled outta bed, greeted mama with a yawn then
Paused to scratch an itch and went, down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I payed my thoughts no attention
Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking her MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say, that I fucking hate you, but

[Verse 2]
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life, rushing through my body
But you got a guy, it's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four
Not like a family of four, just like.. fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways, fuck you, bitch

[Verse 3]
She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador"
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple stores
The basement light is darkened and the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me murder spree, surges on with the next bitch
Tombstones read RIP cause it's pieces they rest in

// epaR //

[Hook:]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the trunk, thumpin' up against the
dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, litter them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
Saw 'em walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

[Hook:]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Vince Staples:]
Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She freaked with dick to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash her where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

[Hook:]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

[Outro:]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull âem like a tutor, in fact
A dead one in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"

// Moonlight //

[Verse 1: Earl]
Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang hockin' lugees in a bible
Dancing with the Devil tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doin'
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I live all over my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She askin' me to dance I ask for my pants
Ended up with an arguement sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hatin' the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillin's all through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet

[Verse 3: Earl]
Bitter sweet seven fist fightin' with a reverend
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight

// Pigeons //

[Verse 1:]
Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4: 4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon so
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, oh

[Hook:]
Wave high to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

[Verse 2:]
Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap this grass? Snap your fucking jabba
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up like fag
I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled
With snacks for after class for the whole class, to snack up
Yeah, right, get over here faster
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper

[Tyler:]
Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas Cage
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, 'bout to jack off, go catch a fucking cab
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back, I'm sleep

[Hook]

[Bridge: x2]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool

[Verse 3:]
I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen
Shit and run back to the lab, need assistance from
Sister with the biggest bumbaclot girls
I'm around calves big cause they run a lot and scream, oh
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius
He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is meanest
Hitting amputees in the knees, Jesus
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where
I take a fucking beat, strip it naked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's O.F
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead bitch
Hammerhat flyer than a bag of ass
And Jane's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress
Last straw, fuck that, I'm who broke the camel's back
Say you want that dope shit, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch

[Outro:]
Told you he can rap, dumb muthafucka

// Stapleton //

[Verse 1]
It's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves
Skate mental truck, smack a faggot in his shirley temple
Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners
At the end of the bar, I spit with the permanents
Learn I'm a curb stoppin' person
Like third strike verdict droppin' jaw droppin' verses
This bigger lips in person, nigga spits some ball's Ernie shit
Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, ho
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch

[Hook]
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Wait, where you goin', what you doin' tonight?
Just wanna know what you doin', come back
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Where you goin', what you doin' tonight?
Stop runnin', where you goin', what you doin'?

[Verse 2]
It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift Rapist in trainin'
Who edge 'bout as straight as some clay-closet gay dick
Ray say hey Earl's a real charming racist
Your birthday day, have some KK cake bitch
Habit have it, grab it fast and attack it, faggot
I'm above average like I'm rappin' in the attic, yeah
I'm crouched in the basement shoutin' "Couch" is the greatest hit
Dirty as the anus is, fans stand in rain for this
They even stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt
Fans probably stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Deerskin Moccasins is on the fuckin' stalk again
Followin' and stalkin' all them larchmont soccer chicks
Choppin' limbs, knawin' legs, through they fuckin' stockings
Him his grandfather sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans
Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us
So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard
So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin' fuck you, son
Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin' 'til the moon come
Woo son, the moonshine got feelin' loose
As the puss of a whore who's used to abuse
My screws pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos
Of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you
You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through
My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of yoo-hoo
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All fuck 'em all
No lube, it's the crew to get use to, faggot
