// Shattered Dreams //

Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokinâ, niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelinâ
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream

I said peace to my dirty water drinkers
Psh, nobody tryna get it clean
Why ain't nobody tell me I was sinkin'?
Ain't nobody tell me I could leave
Yeah, we'd win again, seethinâ within
Seen teeth on the floor, leakinâ again
We hold the door, uh
We build the bridge, we hold the courts
Send a cease and desist to your thieves, nigga
Please do abort, I could feel when you're forcinâ it
Still in a bore riddim
Boy, I take the tour chips and go and get some decent decor
Is you gon' ribbit or will you jump?
Get some more ribbons for the born winners from the jump
Niggas don't listen 'til that whole mission was a bust
No sit-up, but itâs crunch time, shootin' in the clutch
The midsummer sunshine found me on my ones, face drippin', uh
Hate swimmin' through your bloodlines
Motherfuck a judge, same goin' to the one time, yeah
Come and take a stroll in the mud
Dip a toe in it, heard the hammer like a grudge
When you holdin' it close, we was on the cusp
It was holes in the boat, we ain't make a fuss
Uh, chosen

Imprecise words
Yeah, chief, get it 'cause we mean it
Ease up, free smokin', niggas need it
Mask off, mask on, we trick-or-treatin'
Back off, stand-offish and anemic
Yeah, my nigga Ish, told him it's a feelin'
Blast off, buckshot into my ceilin'
Why ain't nobody tell me I was bleedin'?
Please, nobody pinch me out this dream

// Red Water //

Yeah, I know I'm a king, stork on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stork on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stork on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve
Yeah, I know I'm a king, stork on my shoulder, I was sinkin'
I ain't know that I could leave
Papa called me chief
Gotta keep it brief
Locked and load, I can see you lyin' through your teeth
Fingers on my soul, this is 23
Blood in the water, I was walkin' in my sleep
Blood on my father, I forgot another dream
I was playin' with the magic, hide blessings in my sleeve

// Cold Summers //

We roam tundras

The boy been gone a few summers too long from road runnin'
Trunk full of old hunnids
Of course my old lover was scorned, we grow from it
Don't tell me they don't hunt us for sport, I chose substances
No cuddles, the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin'
Choke up on the slugger from home run-ins
Nigga it's on, chest thump, his head thump on the floor
We pressed up on the boy, no more bluffin'
Cold summers, don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my wing tips clipped, I was stuck in a hangar, nigga
Muffle my pain and muzzle my brain up
Really, I'm just makin' sure my promise is kept
Chuck a duece if you know it's the end
Kept the truth in my palm and my chest
See it through, keep a noose hangin' off of my neck
We got the juice, niggas corny as shit
We on the loose, niggas know what it is
We makin' moves, niggas corny as shit
We got the juice, niggas know what it is
Yeah

It is night and like the others I clean my weapons
It is all so familiar

// Nowhere2go //

I keep it, we back, yeah
Ya dig? Yeah
Thinkin' 'bout, yeah, yeah
Every nigga that, uh

Every nigga that's trippin' around me serve as reminder that
I gotta watch my step
I keep it quiet as kept (Ayy, ayy)
Yeah, I think I spent most of my life depressed (Most of my)
Only thing on my mind was death (On my)
Didn't know if my time was next (Next, yeah, yeah)
Tryna refine this shit, I redefined myself
First I had to find it (Uh)
I couldn't find a friend, had to rely on my wits
I be with Mike and Med (Mike, Med)
Nowadays I be with Sage and with Six-press, ya dig?
I'm in L.A. with Glen, please come and claim ya kid
I cannot play with them (Yeah, yeah, whoa)
Let's try a different approach out
I celebrate with a toast
Brodie, you know if you with me we homebound (Homebound)
I need a city to hold down (Hold down)
You niggas gave me a coast (Yeah)
You went and gave me a cape (Cape)
But that never gave me no hope (hope, yeah) (Hope, hope)
I found a new way to cope, it ain't no slave in my soul
But I keep the memories close by (close by), even when I hit a low (I hit a low)
I still give thanks to the most high, I can't do favors no more
If you lame and you broke, and you waiting for cosign
I take a plate to go, bet I could break a row
Noose on my chain is gold
Tell me how you been faking the whole time? (Whole time)
That's how surveillance go
These niggas be playing for both sides
This shit could take a toll, there ain't no (Bro)
There ain't no, yeah (Yeah)
It ain't no place to (Uh!)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

// December 24 //

It is surely time that the speech of the Black culture of America be recognized as a genuine dialect of English. It is in every sense of the word...
Yeah, uh, uh, uh

Allen with the picked 'fro, answer in the outlet
Alley-oopin' all the shit home
Powered-up, out for the assist
Don't panic when it get cold, we go at it, ho
How you want them ribs smoked, family? Uh
Ten toes, know you on your shit already
Big stone, granite and your fist balled
Standin' on the strip
Don't panic when the pig come
Scramble, get the big tall fetti, and then get home
Tally upâtally up the wins though
Don't think he said he pro-violence
But it's gon' be your problem if he did, though
I lived out the way, ayy
Palace where the Crips stay
Silent when the pigs came browsin' in his shit
Bang like two mallets, too callous for your bitch taste
'Member when they had my grandmammy on a drip drink
How much of that gin straight? Could have filled a fish tank
My doggy hit my cell, say he got me off the strength
Ask him, "That's just how it is?" say
"You die and then you live, huh?"
Your heart and then your limbs break
Just catch me when I slip, bro
What's poppin'? Like a hip bone
I told you, these niggas passin' like the Citgo
We passin', niggas know we keep the gas inside the spliff roll
The wind get the ashes in the end, bro
We been took your pass and your credentials, uh
Bad apple, daily clashin' with my kinfolk
Bad acid did damage to my mental
Show you right, it took some passages to get grown
They been called me savage from the get go
Uh

// Ontheway! //

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
These niggas know
Alright, check it out bro, bro, bro, bro
Look
Uh, yeah, yeah
Uh, shit, uh, yeah

My mood really swinging, I peruse like a native would do
What I'm thinking I should do for the sake of myself
No games with this cash, go play with yourself
We stay on your ass
Your sense of safety melt in a flash, bang
Donât know what I'ma say
Cause I don't label the bags, I stay in âem
See you shooting but your angles is trash
Don't play with us, I revisit the past
Port wine and pages of pass
Momma say don't play with them scabs
It's safe to say I see the reason I'm bleeding out
I need you now, closed lips make the mouth breathers frown
Two's a team, three a crowd
Twelve street, I kept some lean around
Help me, it's been a minute since I seen a decent count
The wealth be the labor's fruit
The loop hold up the belt, Gâs felt
All praises due, the juice unattainable
Like Tang in the booth
Dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth
Yeah, yeah, uh

I said the dark face on the news
Clouds grey on the move
On the way like the truth (On the way like the truth)
Yeah, clouds grey on the move
On the way with the-

// The Mint //

Yup, yup, that's right
I'm runnin' things, I'm runnin' things

Hold me down, hold me up
Hold me close 'cause my times is up
Show they true colors, don't know who to trust
Mind workin' like the water when it rush
Grownin' from my father, bitter to his touch
Now I'm solely honor, livin' is a must
All this for my momma 'til I'm dust
God gon' deal the calm, but lost my trust
Sayin' "Every man know many men"
Got me in a jam, I be in my feelings
On the other hand, I just need a moment
My condolence, smoke until the mornin'

Brodie on the corner with a piece on his hip
Give a warning 'fore you blow it in the sky
Tiptoein' over mortar and the brick
Bumpin' shoulders with the devil in disguise
Show the love of water on the rise
Twist, 40s in the morning in the winter
I heard you got your sauce at the enterprise
Evidently, it was rented but it's mine
Evidently, it was written like Nas
I was in the kitchen with that nigga Mike
Gotta listen when I tell ya simmer down
Two years I've been missin', livin' life
You was wildin', every day was trash
Crackers pilin' in to rape the land
Early morning, wash my swollen hands
Hit the showers, cleanse my soul and crash
Tiptoein' over glass, brodie go too fast, told him slow up
Know I use too much of everything at hand
Except the difference is now I control it, I be
In the crib and in the moment, stuck sippin' out the flask
Feet up on the dash, I hit the spliff but don't promote it
Under overpass, no cap
Say I'm ballin' out the hourglass
Grand total, it's a whole lotta raps
Quicksand, scramblin' outta that
Go behind the back, switch hands
The fair's high, niggas know they outta wack
Sterilize your clique, paralyze maritime niggas when
Every time wavy dyin', tappin' in
Savion Glover caught a couple Ls
Took 'em to the neck, motherfucker

Lotta blood to let, peace to make, fuck a check
Uh-uh, lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check
Lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a check
Uh-uh, lotta blood to let, peace to make, give a fuck about a-
Nigga, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, maybe

// The Bends //

Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
We all we got
Switch whips, relocate way out of state
Bada bing, bada bam
It's the puppet master, all of the strings in my hand
Peace to my mans, gotta go be with your fam more (For real)
For real, I feel like the landlord
My niggas came a long way from the Dickies and dirty JanSports
Jack of all trades, was dealing niggas a handful
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Got memories of your face
The photo still on the mantle
It's real when you seal up letters with wax
Shit changed, now the checks that we seein' is handsome, real
Mike WiLLy shit, we went gorilla, they really gave us the ransom
You silly, we taxed 'em, bad blood
Doing 'em dashes and and pulling fast ones
Seen your heart soar, got torn up in the past once
Before a jawn, young god get the cash run
Hard hung heads might starve in the end
Young god get the cash 'fore a jawn thump
Pause wit' your man, call Mos if you can, by God (By God)
Bend, we don't break, we not the bank
Switch whips, relocate all the way out of state
Tell my queens, "Keep mace"
Keep faith, brother man
They stable full of sheep, we stayin' on the lam
Game isn't cheap

// Loosie //

Main line, underneath the skin of the grapevines
Save time, serpent, no need to hiss
Found a reason to live, doubt could be an abyss
Keep fallacies off your lips, see casualties in the wind
Uh, we gathering in remembrance
Galaxy's the distance between us by Christmas
Now we crumbling, leaf over tree pre-twist (I bet)
Your heart skip a beat when you see me next
We stretch harshly, I see y'all weaves stretched (Stretched)
Parsley in your bean, we hard to get involved with
In the blistering cold, watching Harder They Come
Harder they fall, I figured niggas was bold
They proved me wrong quick
Long trip, sifting through memories over dumb spliffs
Young man, flung soliloquy off the tongue-tip, uh
Uh, uh (Worth it)

// Azucar //

Pedal to the metal
Lost foot and it was sugar in my gas tank
My cushion was a bosom on bad days
There's not a black woman I can't thank
You called crying when I told you these the last days
It's all mine, could've split the last plate
Niggas didn't have faith, so I stopped tryin'
Apologize, and we outta time
Please get ya alibi straight, you ain't gotta lie
Shook tradition, did it my way
No sense in looking in the sky
Trace elements meddle with minds
Mind-state live, fissures and fires
Niggas with live ammunitions and the stick on the highway
I only get better with time
That's what my mom say to dodge Satan
Say to kill him this time, oy vey
Well here I go, foot on the line
What's mine, what good is it if it's not, you shook a bit
Sookie, sookie niggas wasn't shit
Face looking like I stumbled out of bed, hundred dollar jet
I piss problems out, the bottle empty
Mama said she used to see my father in me
Said I was not offended
Press, King, Navy, Med, MIKE on the bench
Living life like a nigga put a price on my head
Bless, this how we on it
If you need it and I want it, better come prepared
Going through it like prayers in the night sky
You look like a chair when you folding up
Hands on like a goalie with the puck, don't need any luck
See the ghost of where I was, lonesome as I was

// Eclipse //

Bear arms
Take no prisoners (Yeah)
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is)
The signs say we close to the end (Close)
My mindstate sober, I'm bent
Over the pit, pokin' the flames
Hopin' I don't total my shit, that's me though
Play the game no cheat code
Had to dish 'em a free throw
Ya mouth runnin' when you depose (Facts)
Facts, it's rugged on the peak
Don't stumble, serve culinary treats, bro (Please)
The herd hungry, gotta eat (Woah)
Why its so muddy in the creek, poet?
Threes foes coming by the fleet (Bro)
Keep low, peace, preach it
Ain't so sunny by the motherfuckin' beach
The say so, gonna phone number on the screen (Ah)
Keep low, can't nobody see me sleep
I make more money on my motherfuckin' feet
Yeah, uh (Straight on 'em)

We take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Bear arms)
Take no prisoners
Just make more chips and work the brakes off nigga's shit
(Straight on 'em)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse
Of my shine that I've grown to miss when holding shit in
Open my lids, my eyes said my soul is amiss (Soul is amiss)
The signs say we close to the end (Close to the end)

// Veins //

My nigga
Keep faith

Peace to every crease on your brain
Peace to who came before me in the game
We givin' praise and glory to your name, kid
We cellophane your story so it stays
Since birth mama raised and burped me, I ain't changed
I'm a man, I'm just saying that I stayed imperfect
Earl is not my name, the world is my domain, kid
Air Max 97, traipse on the pavement
Hair got knotty, let it settle on my face, I
I've been eating good you can see it in my tummy
But I'm buggin', I've been spending more money than I'm making
Stuck in Trump Land, watching subtlety decayin'
I ain't touch a xan, when it-
When it's time to put my burnt body in a case
Tell my momma I said thank you
Tryna state facts, I'm tryna get through the day
I'ma play it back, I ain't into showing face, kid

It's been a minute since I heard applause
It's been a minute since you seen or heard from me, I've been swerving calls
It's been a minute since I heard applause

Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dog
Sometimes I feel like I wanna call it off
I can't call it, dog
Big dog, finna rip the collar off, uh
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
I can't call it, dogs
Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it, dogs, ayy

Keep pace, my nigga (Eat paste my nigga)
"Be safe" she said, my nigga
Keep faith, my nigga, (Yeah yeah) ah
Me safe, she safe, keep pace, my nigga (Keep faith)
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace (peace)

Sittin' on a star, thinking how I'm not a star
Just can't call it dog

// Playing Possum //

To my mentors and comrades in arms
Those presence and those gone on
Thank you to my family
(Can you see them now?)
To my partner Mysteria who I love and depend on more than I can say
(For some children)
To my son Thebe (Words like)
Cultural worker and student of life (Home)
Whose growth and insights inspire me, a thousand kisses
(Could not carry any possible meaning)
Thank you to my brothers (But displaced)
My niece (Border)
My nephews, my sisters, my friends (Refugee)
My whole family network (Consider)
Who have let me be distracted and inconsistent in my intention
(The premature daily death of their dreams)
Who've put up with crazy schedules, short tempers, mad dashes, and all the rest
(Consider what staggering memories frighten and abort
The hope that should have been
Perhaps I should just borrow
The remembererâs voice again
While I can and say)
You know the real deal
("To have a home is not a favor")

// Peanut //

Ayy
Ayy, nephew NSA, ayy
Know I'm on the way
Family saw you on that stage, left it not amazed
Thought you up in AA
Now you done and brazed, ayy (Brazed, ayy)
Get the fuck back, you moving like they cut your 'caine, ayy
Lick the nut sack, flooted in some tear-aways (Ayy)
Flushin' through the pain, depression, this is not a phase, ayy
Picking out his grave, couldn't help but feel out of place
Try and catch some rays
Death, it has the sour taste (Sour taste)
Bless my pops, we sent him off and not a hour late
Still in shock and now my heart out somewhere on the range
Outta range, picked the lock and now we elevate
We box 'em out, my shit a million miles away
Niggas featherweight
Like we making food, father's face when I'm not afraid
My Uncle Hugh
