Album: SICK

// Old Friend //

Mm-mm, mm-mm, uh

Strong spirit where the body couldn't get asylum
The cost of living high, don't cross the picket line and get the virus
Wild cat has got 'em in a bind, stay inside
Know I came from out the thicket smilin'
Mad hatters cappin' every line, it doesn't matter to the ten of five
They start hackin' when they can't shrink us
I found the middle in a bit of balance
Fever in the cabin
I knew where we was headed
I ain't countin' no blessings, I sure as shit could measure
Blinkin' for some feasible methods to free yourself
Split it with my hand like Cigarill's
Slick oil in a fish gill
I fill a void with the pen, feel the fear, shrill
Couple stains that I couldn't shield
My brother, Brain, that we couldn't shield
Couple came, couple went still
And what remain of the wolves, nil
I held the page, gave the book ears
Whispered "Thanks", hella pain, heavy rain in the Catskills
Played the shade, quite a deal, glad we stayed friends

// 2010 //

Huh

I'ma need a bigger bag for the cohort
Tryna make a millionaire out of slum dogs
Bet that, head crack, blunt force
Cozy with the east Africans up north
Where seven make a three, turn a ten by law
Crescent moon wink, when I blinked it was gone
Left the crib, smacked, no sheath on the sword
Made it by the skin of my teeth, thank God
'03, momma rockin' Liz Claiborne
Had her stressin' up the wall playin' Mary J. songs
Rainy day came, couldn't rinse the stains off
Long way to go, we already came far
Story stayed the same, it was never made up
Threw me loose change, look at what I made of it
When the mood change, I'ma poker-face 'em
It's a new day, who got all the aces?
Who be foldin' late? Who know when to play dead?
Who sit up straight when the roof caved in?
Had a full plate, you ain't wanna split it
Tell it to you straight, you ain't wanna listen
Cup runneth over the brim
Bust open, there's no closin' the lid
Drumroll, here go my lil' entrance
Gung ho, I'm the one that go get it
Five Os on me like the Olympics
Pure gold, somethin' told me, "Don't mix it"
Caught a feelin', momma had me out Temple
Not religious, we was really out Philly
Livin' on the fly tryna wing it
We got us a fire to rekindle
Redirect the fight where it's meant for
Triumph over plight and immense loss
Ride alone at night, I get clear thoughts
Caught a couple slights and I veered off
Saw another height, had my ears poppin'
Walked outside, it was still gorgeous
Sharp incisors reveal slowly

In the dark inside, we was real hungry
On a seven of the five, we was real hungry
Uh, niggas still drummin'
Foot shook ground when I stepped on it
Didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more
In the dark inside, we was real hungry
On a seven of the five, we was real hungry
And I didn't look back when I broke soil
'Cause every time I did it would hurt more

Alright
Yessir, this nigga spittin'
Damn, nigga

// Sick! //

And I'll give you a kiss
Ugh, some, ugh
Yes sir, somethin' gotta give

Somethin' gotta give, spin another web
Head home, mess with Fisk, like I'm Spider-Man
Felt it on a whim
You'll fall and slip again, I heard life a trip (What a trip)
Get it how you live (Yeah), I guess it's all you get (Get)
Take it on the chin (Chin), ugh (Ugh)
Pleasure by the gram
Gas siphonin', smoke in my diaphragm (Diaphragm)
Stem caps, molly, black Betty, bam-ba-lam
They be out there, shorty really from the West
Just an alley cat, legend in the fucking flesh
Quit the frat, double back, I need a percent
Blast and laugh, karma, facts, that's a messy bitch
Can't go out sad, can't go outside no more, 'cause niggas sick, ayy
Fuck the second chance, I won't let the devil in
Somethin' gotta give, cover me, I'm going in, ugh
Pressure blow the lid, factor in the overhead
Live with no regrets, tell 'em when to tote a fif' (Yeah)
I could count the chips, not on what the teller said
That's expensive shit, like my Uncle Fela said
(Cover me, I'm going in)

[Fela Kuti:]
So really, art is what is happening at a particular time of a people's development or underdevelopment, you see. So I think, as far as Africa is concerned, music cannot be for enjoyment, music has to be for revolution. Really working with the people, enlightening the people and doing your duty as a citizen to play music and act and do something about the system. If you feel bad about it, do something about it.

// Vision //

It would be simple, wouldn't it?
My father was away trapping
Watch lives
What happened to you?
Magic
What's magic?

Out with the vision myself (Myself)
I had to fend for myself (Myself)
I get the green like it's kelp (It's kelp)
I put that shit in the pail (Pail)
Make sure my mama do well (Do well)
All of my bitches do well (Do well)
All of my bitches do well (Do well)
My bitches shine like jew-els (Jew-els)
I get that cash through the wire (Wire)
I make 'em plays on the cell (Cell)
I free my sister out cell (Cell)
I got that check through the mail (The mail)
Jupiter, jumbo, or giant (Giant)
Whippin' that paint, Jumbalaya ('laya)
I held your hoe with a spell (Spell)
I put that bitch on the trail (Trail)
Hope I be smoking the finest (Finest)
Running the game like a tyrant (Tyrant)
Winter when nothing else fails (Fails)
Winter still bringing you hell (You hell)
Simply sin for me, bitch, sing a symphony
Bitch just defending me, she thought that this was skin-deep (Deep)
Been took a bag, been told you that you been weak
Been had the mag, been on the line, assembly
Tragedy in the street (Street)
Lookin' for someone to laugh with me, incomplete
Lookin' for someone to match with me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone that blast for me, Desert Eagle
Lookin' for someone to fly with me, get high with me, no Visine
Just see what my eyes see, open my eyes, free me
Just remind me where I'm from and what's going on
What's happening? The gas going, the motor flowing
Bitch, what's happening? Remind me where I'm from
And what's happening? The motor going, the gas flowing
Bitch, what's happening?

I did some dirt with the clique
Went and got cliqued by myself
Couldn't belittle myself
Couldn't be all weak-as-hell (Hell)
I just be weary of self (Self)
I had to fend for myself (I had to fend for myself)
Had to get low like the jail pose
Check rear-view, then lose the tail, bro (Check rear-view, then lose the tail)
I'ma skip over the hellhole
I had the vision myself
They clouded me at a standstill
I picked up a penny and left (Penny and left)
I picked up the clip (With a step) with a step
Singular current event, everything we in the midst of
How long you waiving the rent? (Ugh)
Moratorium extendo, I'm just evading the pit
Ain't no parade in the tent (Tent)
Fuck out my face with syringe
Fixing my face, feigning interest
'Lone, all my patience get thin (Everything takes patience)
Everything he say, I missed it
Can't believe you get paid for this shit (Whatever stock up the shelves)
Whatever stock up the shelves
Niggas thinking that they figured it out
Hit the lab, whip up a cell
They itching for it, I seen it's been a drought
I hear the toll of the bell, tried to atone with a prayer (Prayer)
Know the toll never tell (Tell)
You gon' see when you get there, and he out, ugh

I would do anything to make my children happy
Please, black girl, is there anything you can do to help me?
Maybe there is... (Magic)
How can I make our Black children happy without any magic?
It depends upon what you tell them
Magic is only make-believe and our children do not need to grow up in a make-believe world. You need to tell them the truth and help make them feel proud of who they are. The magic of truth is much more powerful than magic of make-believe
But what can I tell them?
Tell them that they're beautiful. Tell them that they're Black
Here, take hold of my wing, and I will take you to someone who can give you something even better than magic

// Tabula Rasa //

Ugh, off the strength, I'm not as numb as I thought
I'm broken links, my circle shrinking smaller
Satellite revolve, my core is a cauldron
Surrendered orbits
Cross-check what's really real and what's performance
Speak for self, but wondering who else really on it
Who's really all in?
(Hello) Trouble calling
My phone don't ping, I'm buzzed, leave me alone
Truth with a stash pocket for a lie
The document is alive, I speak life
Every border gets revised if dissolved
What defines what is charged?
Haven't made up my mind if I'm assigned to the stars
I slide when I want, I'm inside of the funk, trust
She want up when it dump, it came from the sludge
Involuntary, shooting foundations in studs
Tears and snot bubbles, sob puddles
I lay in the wet spot
Listen, let's not conflate, I give what I take
It's the hunt, there is the chase
Some talk like they never got punched in the face
You can't see clearly now, don't come near me
Wails of the weary, loop max infinite
Draw me closer, damn near intimate

And I'll give you a kiss

The flier said "Grown and Sexy"
I came through over-proofing the plastic Pepsi bottle
Security didn't check me
Skipped coat check, they playin' the oldies
I'ma go 'head and get sweaty
Plus saved the ten-piece
It's hell up in Harlem, so meet me 'cross 110th Street
If the tree's a bargain, barsâthat don't really tempt me
I'm from where every car foreign
And we drive 'em on empty (Zimbabwe)
Bury me in a borrowed suit
Give my babies my rhyme books, but tell 'em, "Do you"
Give my enemies the good news: Time flew
We was probably brothers back then like T-R-U
No jerseys, no durags, hard-bottom shoes
Niggas tired of the foolishness
No disrespect, it's a lotta mids in the room
My pack loud, cut right through
Kofi Annan in the booth, Soyinka in the stu'
Sese Seko Mobutu if the DJ play something smooth (Slide on 'em)
It's a move, I don't dance, but maybe tonight, maybe tonight
I don't know her and I don't even mind if it is the strobe light
Live for the living
I made chicken late night in my boxers, burning up the kitchen
She passed out right when I was done fixing
I watch reruns in the dark, fingers and lips glistening

Ooh, get 'em
I'm so damn proud of myself
I did this for you, G, alright?

Been to there and back, tall tales tossed to the breeze
We keep facts in the midnight wax, family tree sap
Light leak through the leaves on familiar tracks
I know it's real even when I'm feeling bad
Resilient as they built the black
She shimmy into theâyeah, that's consent gettin' established
You only trash if you trash, I keep it simple and dynamic
Trust the passage rites to life's chapters
I have to write to find balance
This game of telephone massive
I do what I have to with the fragments
The madness method rampant these days, I let the panic pass me
Featherweight, my heart was straight despite baggage
Asymptomatic, but I get sick of the delaysâfaster, faster
Practicing practice in what I preach, keep pace
The calcium on my teeth fade
Streets are blazed with the anger complacency and deceit create
Ice sheet break, I couldn't weave weight
All I could say to the times that I couldn't freeze-frame, bleak fate
You got so much to bleed to clean-slate (I've got so much of myâ)
The bag of tricks in my sleeve breaks
Southpaw under the North Star, forcing all the league changes
(I've got so) Don't sleep late

I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much
I, I've got so much
I

// Lye //

Yep, yep, yep

Same one that I forgot to praise still above me
One thing about it, I'ma beat 'em to the punches
Stumped all day, thinkin', "Mama, where the love went?"
With every triplet of trips around the sun, some of the sludge get thicker
I'm chippin' away at crust
Hold your head, your shit is in for a whole 'nother bust
Roamin' the citadel, on foot eleven when the spliff gave me a rush
Play in the cuts like a DJ
Let me know if you wanna tangle with some
Lemon merengue, Wallabees sole stained gum
Explorin' a couple different avenues and stayin' dangerous, day drunk, yeah
Sometimes the pain sit and fester into hate, beloved
I'm workin' on it
It's worth the time
Further down the line
Might realize
What's yours obviously mine
Toss the sword back into the vines
Callin' out for Lord, lookin' low and high
Finally found it at the core of my dimming fire
What's a little lie? What's a little lie?
Tell 'em

Gotta make it straight
Fill the jar, it's hot
The longer you can stand it, the straighter it's gon' be
I gritted my teeth, my eyes watered, my nose was runnin'
I couldn't stand it any longer
Then my head caught fire

// Lobby (int) //

You know what it is, don't overreact
I'm twenty-six, felonious past
Rolling with the pack, even when it switch
Guarantee you miss, don't get too attached
Heavy weight on my back
Chamberlain with the stats
Don't play with it, sailing the land
Niggas stay with the plan, we anchored in
When I get the thrax, I'm inhaling
I happen to know the assailant
I'm happy to throw off the trail
Cover your nose, it's surveillance
I know it's a quota to fill
Where you going and what's your intent?
I ain't notice the run of the mill
I ain't known for hugging the fence
Head hard, I'm stubborn as shit
Quick start, can't cover the steps
Inside like my partner from 65th
Big love, but I'm from the mid
I'm coming home, but love where he slid

And he is safe, well, he is superhuman
Wow, overturned call, what a slide

// God Laughs //

The same dust can't stay: I gotta clean or I can't think
Resort to cantankerous means on the cash play, rat races
The cheese sit in the trap, waitin'
Snap, then we break; somethin' reachin' for me from the waist
These days, I'm mindful of what I embrace
Operating on an empty tank, spank me, fumes fueling a flame
My grandfather spoke thirteen languages
Somehow never had nothing to say to Boot Raymond
Sensed hazel, made sense of it through prayer
Booze is a fool's fragrance
[?] the [?] saved us
Through his brain getting chipped away at daily
His body on a road where his mind flailed and funeral whaled us
No beluga, no Bob, just mood swingin'
True pain, I couldn't eat or sleep for seven days
Maimed me, I ain't weak
Keep changing for the better, what to do when your job thankless
In the middle of the marsh where mosquitoes chomp ankles
Swamp marching on on the quest for my lost halo, God

// Titanic //

Give it to you straight, no frills
What I think might pay the bills
Spit on the cam like Makaveli (Fuck y'all)
Came home in the 2011
Pasadena, John calling me Relly
Ain't know where none of this shit was headed (I ain't even know)
In a LAC, Nak gon' protect me
Bro just crashed, fucked up his Dodge
Now he shopping for another HEMI (Escape from Rock, I wrecked the wheel)
Did the dash, got outta dodge
Crashed out grandmama car
They got tipped off by a civilian (Yes sir)
Yes sir, think I already feel it
Sweatshirt, 'cause you know how revenge is best served
Cold dish (Pressure cookin' roast)
No assist, I'm out here on a mission
Triple doublin' off of the strips
Get ghost like I need a killer
Get ghost like a apparition
Home town hold me down like a rock
So you know how I gotta skip it (Skip, skip it)
So you know just how we living
Took it slow, saw what it could give me
Hit the road, go a mile a minute
Mask on like a supervillain
Daniel, who you in the den with? Lion
Wasn't lying when I told
Dawg's on the floor now 'cause I skinned 'em
On the 10, east homebound
I just broke down with the chemist (Yeah)
Midtown, niggas pimpin' (You know how we get it)
Iceberg, MAC kinda slim
What they couldn't see sink the ships
Capsize mean you's a flip (We know you)
Send a postcard from the depth
Bleed the vein 'til nothing left
You look drained, you should get some rest (Yeah, go get some rest)
You look drained, you should get some rest

// Fire In The Hole //

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Blood sippin')
Blood, blood, blood, blood

Seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond
She see it and salt sprinkle
I needed another go
I'm seeing her when I want

Fire leaping out the hole
Deep breathing only make it grow
Ain't wanna leave the clutch (Clutch)
Far be it for me to plead with y'all
Hit, leanin' into the crutch
Speedin' through the lulls
Take heed, we took an oath to the sword
The shield took a couple chinks but it never broke
I know what he mean, how I play it based on what I'm shown
Consolidate the cream, then I'm headed home
She ain't shine like fourteen karat gold, rewiring
Patchin' holes
It's no rewinding, for the umpteenth time, it's only forward
Peace to AKAI SOLO, the soldier
I couldn't toast a drink to demise, I heard the clink
Life could change in the blink of an eye, I'm wrinklin' time
I'ma leave it to y'all to get hoodwinked and surprised
Threw on some Bootsy, I rather be with you when I'm high
I went ahead and mixed some Beetle Juice with the wine
Skin contact, peeling her eyes, squeeze down
It's been a minute since I blew up your line
I leave town fast
Out the dungeon like Outkast
Funnels with the loud pack
Hunter's boots crunchin' through the brown grass

Blood
Blood seeping into the mulch, I needed a quick result
I read it and don't respond
She see it and sprinkle salt
I needed another go
I'm seeing her when I want
Uh
Uh
Uh
