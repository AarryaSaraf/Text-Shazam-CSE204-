Oh, when the saints go marching in
Well, when the saints go marching in
I wanna be right there in that number, number
When the saints go marching in

Well, when the saints go marching in
When the saints go marching in

Go, go go
Go, go go

Well, when the saints go marching in

// St. Louis Blues //

St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere

I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town

Well, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
Oh, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town
St. Louis woman

St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, you know she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere

Got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be
Oh, that gal's gotta heart like a rock cast in the sea
Well, oh hell, she wouldn't have gone so far from me

// How Deep Is The Ocean? //

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How high is the sky?

// Rock Around The Clock //

One, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight

Put your glad rags on and join me, hon'
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight

When, when the clock strikes two, three and four
If the band slows down, we'll yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight

Yeah, and when the clock chimes five, six and seven
We'll be rockin' up in seventh heaven
Gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight, yeah
Oh, yeah

Well, we're gonna rock around the clock
Oh, we're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock around the clock tonight

We're gonna rock, rock, rock around the clock, clock, clock
We're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock around the clock tonight

And when the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then
Start a rockin' around [?] again
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight

We're gonna rock, rock, rock around the clock, clock, clock
We're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock

// That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day) //

Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Yeah

Up in the mornin' out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day
Well fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun

Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Take me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun

Just roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun

// Without A Song //

Without a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good, no how
Without a song, without a song
