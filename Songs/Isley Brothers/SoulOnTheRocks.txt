// Got To Have You Back //

Got to have you back I need you
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride
Made me break your heart
Now our love has died
I see a closing door - a door never more
A door of jealousy between your love and me
Now I face a storm of tears
You took the sunshine from my face
Now I'm just another man
Who walks the undestined way
Without your guiding hand
I can hardly tell when I'm the man
Pride made a fool of me
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me

And I've got to have you back I need you
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you
Cos I need you girl
I've been told - it's a loneliness
Oh dark is the emptiness
Since you've been gone in me
Oh gone is the lover I need
Pride destroyed the love we knew
But not my need for you
Without your love around
My whole world is falling down - falling down - all around
And I've got to have you back

Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back
Got to have you back

I see a closing door...

Got to have you back - I'm drowning in misery
Got to have you back - my pride made a fool of me
Got to have you back - my whole world is falling down
Got to have you back - without your sweet love around

Got to have you back

// That's The Way Love Is //

As the bitter tears fall from your eyes
Oh, a thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you loved has departed
And you're left alone and brokenhearted
Girl, love just comes and it goes
How long it's gonna last, nobody knows

Girl, that's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, That's the way love is)

I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road
And your heart is carryin' a heavy load
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend
Oh, and your whole world's cavin' in
But now, it's time to be strong
You've gotta forget him now that's he's gone

And just remember, that's the way, love is (that's the way love is)

Love can be a hurting thing
Or it can be warm as warm as a breath of spring
When love is present everything's alright
But when it's gone, you toss and turn all night
Now, listen girl
Oh, I know love gets rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
Girl, I've been hurt by love, yeah, yes I have
So I know just what you're goin' through
Oh, you wish that you were never born
Oh You'll forget him one that he's gone

And just remember
That's the way love is
That's the way (That's the way love is)
Oh, that's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is)

Love is here today and gone tomorrow
All your joy turns to sorrow
One day gladness - the next day sadness
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

// Whispers (Gettin' Louder) //

Calling your name, Peaches
Calling your name, Peaches
In my lonely, lonely room, there's nothing left but the past
I think of how, my love, you speak
And why it didn't last, I think of how sweet all the love was
All the good times we had
I want you to come home, cause I feel so all alone
And I feel so sad
Calling out your name, Peaches
The whispers gettin' louder
Calling your name, Peaches
Don't you hear, Peaches
Don't you hear it, little baby?
Every time I think about you
I can hear you calling my name
And every time I'm all alone
The whispers be come back again
Don't you hear it, Peaches?
Don't you hear it, little baby?
The whispers gettin' louder
Whispers gettin' louder
Calling your name
Hear it baby
Calling to you Peaches
Fades... Louder, baby...

// Tell Me It's Just A Rumor Baby //

Tell me it is just a rumor, baby
Ooh baby

Another day is passing by
And here I sit in sorrow (Sorrow)
Tears streamin' from my eyes
I'm afraid to face tomorrow ('Morrow)
The things I hear from my friends
Tryin' to make me see (See)
Your love is gone
You're movin' on
Soon be leaving me

So, tell me it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Ooh babe

They say you've found another love
You don't need me any longer (Longer)
It may be pride I feel inside
'Cause my love is growing stronger (Stronger)
I pay the cost of the love I lost
If I can't turn to you (You)
And here what seems to be the thing
That the people say is true

Come on and tell me, just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Tell me (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Oh oh

Listen to me, baby
I just need to conceal
The way I truly feel
I love you too much to hide it
There's no need to deny
I love you so (Even though)

I'm going insane from loving in vain
And you'll soon make a fool of me (Me)
But I can't accept a word I hear
Unless you say the same to me

Come on and tell me, it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Come on and tell me, yeah (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)

Ooh, ooh
Tell me it is just a rumor, baby
Come on and tell me it's just a rumor, baby
Oh no, tell me
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)

// One Too Many Heartaches //

Ooh, once more, my love
You say you're sorry you caused me pain
But this time is the last time
You'll never break my heart again

'Cause it's one too many times
This poor heart of mine has tried
One too many tears
These tired old eyes of mine has cried
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again
I'm sorry

Time and time again
I tried to believe it could be true
Heartache after heartache
I stood the pain just to be with you

But it's one too many chances
You only used and pushed aside
One too many lonely, lonely night
I sacrificed my pride
One too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck
I can't stand it
I can't take it, no
One, one, one, one, one
Too many heartaches
For this heart of mine
Try your luck again

// It's Out Of The Question //

It's out of the question
It's out of the question

Could not be another love as sweet as you
With lips that could kiss mine the way yours do
With a twinkle in her eyes for me alone
Now could I want another for my own?

It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

Could not be a song with a melody
That's beautiful as your voice sounds to me
Your total quality it can't be beat
Now could a melody be that sweet?

It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

I couldn't do it and I ain't gonna try
That would be a hard task for any guy
(What could I do? All he could do)
Is try to be grateful and always be faithful
(I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one)

Oh, now could there be a vague possibility
That there's greater joy than what you bring to me?
Perhaps there is, but I don't think so
Could I ever, ever let you go?

It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
(Don't you know now)
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
It's out of the question
(No doubt about it)
It's out of the question
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question

// Why When Love Is Gone //

Ooh
Your love made a slave of me
But the love you gave you took away from me
Foolishly, I believed in you
What a fool I was, thinking your love was true

Selfishly, you broke my heart (My heart)
You were only fooling from the start (You were only fooling)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although you're gone and I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

Your love was [?] when it started
Darling, why'd you leave me broken hearted?
Why'd you swear to always care
Then you walk away and leave me in despair?

Heartlessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Oh, why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on

Ooh
Selflessly, you told me lies (Me lies)
Planning all the time to say goodbye (Planning all the time)
Still I have but one regret (Regret)
Although love is gone, I can't forget

Why when the love is gone?
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on?
Why when the love is gone?
Why does my heart keep holding on
Oh, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Tell me why, oh why
Oh why my heart...

// Save Me From This Misery //

Oh, I'm in bad shape since you've been gone
I lay in bed and cry the whole day long
I can find my mind beginning to crack
I gotta find a way to get you back
I don't want a loneliness to be my destiny
Baby, save me from this misery
Can't sleep, full of thoughts in my head
Feel like I got rocks in my bed

Oh, your lipstick stains on my shirt
Add more pain to my hurt
In a place where deeply, there's no doubt
'Cause it reminds me of a kiss I have to live without

Girl, you gotta have pity on me
Honey, save me from this misery
Oh, I need you so bad
Baby, my heart is 'bout to drive me mad
Oh girl, you gotta (Save me from this misery)
Oh, I need somebody right now (Save me from this misery)

Oh, I'm tired of cryin', tossin' and turnin'
These salty tears keep my eyes burning
Believe me woman, I'm in pitiful shape
Can't take no more hurt, or my heart will surely break
Your love, woman, is the only remedy
Baby, save me from this misery
Oh, I'm hurt so inside me
I need your love, I ain't got no pride

(I'm in misery) Gotta find a way to stop these tears
(Only you can save me girl) Feel like I've been crying for a thousand years
(I'm in misery) Girl I'm so lost without you
(Only you can save me girl) I need you, I need you, I need you, yes I do

// Little Miss Sweetness //

Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four

But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world

If ever a man had a sweet tooth
I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read

But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought
Put together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world

Ooh yeah, now listen to me you sweet thing
Hear what I have to say
If ever you need somebody
Send for me without delay

But do one thing for me
Don't ever go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar
You will surely melt away

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world, oh yeah
The sweetest girl in the world, oh sweetest girl

// Good Things //

Oh, seems this world's got you down
You're feeling bad vibrations frown, now
But open your eyes, girl, look at me
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

And when your world don't just seem right, now
And your life's gettin' you uptight (You uptight)
You can change that wrong for right (wrong to right)
'Cause I was there myself last night (there last night)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby
I, I, I won't have nobody now
(No one around) To bring you down
Well, it's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing, girl

Gotta hear me, you can't beat 'em all, if you try (If you try)
They don't care if you live or die (Live or die)
'Cause they're losers, what a shame (What a shame)
I'm gonna show you to a brand new game (Brand new game)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing, baby

I won't tell you no, no lies
When I'm through, you will realize (Realise)
For the first time, it seems right (It seems right)
I'm gonna stay right here tonight (Here tonight)

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a, oh, good thing, baby
No no, no, nobody, no one around, to bring you down
It's a groovy world, girl
Let me bring you to a good, good, good, good thing

(Good thing, baby) Good thing
(Good thing, baby) I don't know what to do here
(Good thing, baby) Hey, good thing
(Good thing, baby) You know I wanna love it
(Good thing, baby) Come on baby, sit down here with me
(Good thing, baby) Get all over me baby, oh baby I love you
(Good thing, baby) Sit down here with me

// Catching Up On Time //

I'm catching up on time I've lost
I'm making up all the time I've wasted
I'm catching up on time I've lost
Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted

I was dancin' free and having fun
And I really didn't give a care
And you must agree that you might see me
Most any and everywhere

Once I saw you
(Saw you)
And I met you
(Met you)
Tried to call you
(Call you)
Had to get you
(Get you)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Oh, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

I was breaking hearts and taking names
And I wouldn't had stopped at that
But you made me see in spite of me
That that ain't where it's at

Yes, you saw me
(Saw me)
And you caught me
(Caught me)
Then you fought me
(Fought me)
But you taught me
(Taught me)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
Oh, I'm catching up, I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

I bet your wondering why I'm hard to find
But [?] still exists
To procrastinate is an awful fate
'Cause you never head the list

What I'm sayin'
(Sayin')
So true
(So true)
I'm not playin'
(Playin')
Girl, I want you
(Want you)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Yeah, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching on up, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catchin up

// Behind A Painted Smile //

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

My life's a masquerade
A world of let's pretend, dear
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear

But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no

(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

I can't let you see
All the tears I'm crying
You would pity me 
That would be like dying

If I can't have your love
I don't need your sympathy

(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

My life is a masquerade
Since you took your love away

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
I just can't let you see
How much you hurting me

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
