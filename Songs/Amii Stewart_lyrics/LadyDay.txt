// The Man I Love //

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who wouldâwould you?
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who wouldâwould you?
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love

// God Bless The Child //

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round your door
When you're gone, and spending ends
They don't come no more

Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

// Fine And Mellow //

My man don't love me
Treats me oh, so mean
My man, he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

But if you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home every day
Just treat me right, baby
And I'll stay home night and day
But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like a faucet
It turns off and on
Some times when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone

// Don't Explain //

Hush now, don't explain
Just say you'll remain
I'm glad you're back
Don't explain

Quiet, don't explain
What is there to gain?
Skip that lipstick
Don't explain

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts are of you
For I'm so completely yours
Cry to hear folks chatter
And I know you cheat
Right or wrong don't matter
When you're with me, sweet

Hush now, don't explain
You're my joy and pain
My life's yours, love
Don't explain

// Night And Day //

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon
Under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you night and day

Day and night, why's it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
