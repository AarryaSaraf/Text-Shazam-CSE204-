// Working Late Tonight //

I saw you through the doorway
I watched you hold her tight
You said let's go to your place
You said let's go and spend the night

And you laughed as you spoke
Oh, but I don't see the joke
You walked throughout the door
And out my life

And now I shut into my raincoat
It's easy to disguise
I ought to make my mind up
Or hide the pain behind my eyes

Oh, I work night and day
In this small old caf√©
Finding that the more
I work the less I hurt

I'm working late tonight
I'm doing double time
Hiding from emotion and I'm so tired
Love is still in motion and I find

I'm working late tonight
I'm doing double time
'Cause being to working late tonight
Helps keep you off my mind

So now I'm washing dishes
And getting dirty hands
While you get her three wishes
I'm still cleaning pots and pans

Well, we say life is tough
At the top that's fair enough
But living at the bottom's not so hot

I'm working late tonight
I'm doing double time
Hiding from emotion and I'm so tired
Love is still in motion and I find

I'm working late tonight
I'm doing double time
'Cause being to working late tonight
Helps keep you off my mind

And you laughed as you spoke
Oh, but I don't see the joke
You walked throughout the door
And out my life

Ooh ooh
I'm working late tonight
I'm working late tonight

Ooh ooh
I'm working late tonight
I'm working late tonight

Ooh ooh
I'm working late tonight
I'm working late tonight

Ooh ooh
I'm working late tonight

I'm working late tonight

I'm working late tonight

I'm working late tonight

I'm working late tonight

// Sweet Emotion //

Every star is out tonight
To light our love
So round the moon so full
And bright so high above
But if you look real closely
There's only me, there's only you
And when you hold me closely, oh-whoa

And now the sky melts in the sea
Like they are one
It's hard to tell where one thought starts
And where ends one
That's the way our love is
You part of me and me part of you
That's just what love is, oh-whoa

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

You took me from the surface
To a deeper deep
Showing me that you
And you are life for me
Our love will last forever
Me loving you, you loving me
We'll always be together, whoa, yeah, yeah

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions

// You To Me //

Our love is an endless river
Keeps on flowing on and on forever
Each dream like a forest flower
Keeps on growing every hour

We can almost touch the horizon's edge
So reaching further
Then we can even light up the star ahead
I know we were bound by destiny
We will always be

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

Our love is a perfect circle
Has no start or end, cannot be broken
Stronger than a moment's weakness
It knows no secrets, we both believe it

No one's ever gonna come between
The love we're sharing
And no one's gonna take away our dream
'Cause there's more than words could ever say
How can I explain?

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
You to me are everything, baby

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
