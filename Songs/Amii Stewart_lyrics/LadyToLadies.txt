// Why //

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me

Hey... this kind of trouble's only just begun
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut

That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

Tell me...
Why
Why

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking

And I've heard is said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides...
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking this boat is sinking)

Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out turning inside out

Tell me...
Why
Tell me...
Why

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread

These are the tears...
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread

These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?

'Cause I don't think you know how I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
I don't think you know what I feel
You don't know what I feel

// Got To Be Real //

What you find-ah
What you feel now
What you know-ah
To be real

What you find, ah
(I think I love you, baby)
What you feel now
(I feel I need you, baby)
What you know-ah
To be real

Ooh, your love's for real now
You know that your love is my love
My love is your love
Our love is here to stay

What you find-ah
What you feel now
What you know-ah
To be real

Ooh, your love's for real now
You know that your love is my love
My love is your love
Our love is here to stay

What you find-ah
(I think I love you, baby)
What you feel now
(I feel I need you, baby)
What you know-ah
To be real

What you find-ah
(I think I love you, baby)
What you feel now
(I feel I need you)
What you know-ah
To be real (it's time to be real)
To be real (it's time to be real)
To be real

What you find-ah
What you feel now
What you know-ah
To be real

What you find-ah
What you feel now
What you know-ah
To be real
To be real (it's time to be real)
(It's time to be real) to be real (it's time to be real, it's time to be real)
To be real (it's time to be real, it's time to be real)
To be real (it's time to be real, it's time to be real)
To be real (real, real, real), to be real

// Private Dancer //

Well, the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

You don't think of them as human
You don't think of them at all
You keep your mind on the money
Keeping your eyes on the wall

I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
I'll do what you want me to do
I'm your private dancer
A dancer for money
And any old music will do

I want to make a million dollars
I want to live out by the sea
Have a husband and some children
Yeah, I guess I want a family

All the men come in these places
And the men are all the same
You don't look at their faces
And you don't ask their names

// MacArthur Park //

Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers
By the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have the recipe again
Oh, no

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh, after all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no
Oh, no

No, no
Oh, no

// You Belong To Me //

Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own

You belong to me
(Tell her you were fooling)
You belong to me
(You don't even know her)
You belong to me
(Tell her that I love you)
You belong to me

You belong to me
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
Locked the door

You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
Well, I've got loving eyes
Of my own, my own
Baby, baby, baby...

You belong to me
(Tell her, tell her you were fooling)
You belong to me
(You belong, you belong, you belong to me)
You belong to me
(Tell her, tell her that I love you)
You belong to me
(I've known you from a long time ago, baby)

// Lady Marmalade //

Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
Hey sister, go sister, soul sister, go sister
He met marmalade down in old New Orleans
Struttin' her stuff on the street

She said
Hello, hey Joe, you wanna give it a go?
Mmm, mmm

Itchi gitchi ya ya da da
Itchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha-choca-lata ya ya
Creole lady marmalade

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

He sat in her boudoir while she freshened up
The boy drank all her magnolia-wine
On the black satin sheets when he started to freak

Itchi gitchi ya ya da da
Itchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha-choca-lata ya ya
Creole lady marmalade

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Touching her skin feelin' silky smooth
Colour of cafÃ© au lait
Made the savage beast inside
Roar until it cried, more, more, more

Now he's back home doing nine to five
Living his grey flannel life
But when he turns off to sleep
Old memories creep, more, more, more

Itchi gitchi ya ya da da da
Itchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha-choco-lata ya ya
Creole lady marmalade

Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir?
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Itchi gitchi ya ya da da
Itchi gitchi ya ya here
Mocha-choco-lata ya ya
Creole lady marmalade
