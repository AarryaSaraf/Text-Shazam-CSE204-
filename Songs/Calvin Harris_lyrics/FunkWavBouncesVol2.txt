Don't really do one night shit
'Cause one night make 'em wanna whole life it
You know, I left my old lover in crisis
'Cause the new girl a-hella up tight
And God broke the mold when he made my type
You got the same vibe, that's what I like (Yeah)

Was all about me, and talk about me
And look at my pics all day (All day)
You always say, "Please" when I got to leave
And say it ain't big to stay (Yes)

I don't love you but you know I fuck with you
I think I wanna fly you to PerÃº from Malibu
I wish I had you to myself, I like your attitude, you too fly
She been talkin' to her friends, talkin' 'bout the new guy
Talkin' 'bout the money that I'm spendin'
I got visions so you winnin'
Body fine, need a mitten
If I fuck up, they're forgiven
I was dead on relationships, you made me feel like livin'
I'ma stand on the business, 'cause I
I got multimillion plans for us all to survive
All I need for you to do is never fold and don't lie
I felt like you was the one when I had looked in your eyes
Open the door, she's seen the Ghost and we should go take a ride
Doin' the most, don't ever post, don't let 'em see what we got
We're on the boat, enjoyin' the culture, let me get right inside
This shit new to me, I never show nobody this side

[Normani:]
This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything

This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything

[Tinashe:]
(Might love me, baby)
(Love) Been testing my patience
(Love) Don't you keep me waitin'
Energy, chemistry, you and me
Can't be made up
(Love) Has been cultivated
(Falls) I'm yours for the taking
Fantasies, on repeat, you and me
Kissin' naked, love

Mm, no
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, whoa

// Ready Or Not //

[Busta Rhymes:]
Calvin Harris
Busta Bust
Is they ready?
Yeah
It's only right y'all get on board this global express
And after we go around the globe, let's take this shit beyond the galaxy

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

Please be clear, I ain't never, never, never gonna stop
You better be careful, 'cause every single time you'll see me drop
I'm comin' to get 'em and celebrate it, cop another yacht
Be fuckin' shit up, is you wit' me? (Let's go)
You know I got it for ya 'cause you need that
I make 'em scream a line until you hear a lot of feedback
And then I hit the block until the shit is off the meat rack
Funny, Calvin, they want you to bring the beat back (Let's go)
Look, you don't really wanna do it (Heh-eh)
Go against me never, I be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time when I really get up on it
It's nothin' we know, and they already knew it
And it ain't nothin' really to it 'cause we 'bout to let it blow (Blow)
Fireworks, people, now we givin' 'em a show
Never chill, gotta know a lot of money on the flo'
If it ain't nothin' else, you gotta let 'em know, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

Step up in the spot like another block
Every time I drop, stop, they ain't even got a clue (Clue)
Regularly trust I really need to be seen (Seen)
Medically tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, others think they better than me, boo (Boo)
'Til they try to squeeze they little foot up in my shoe
That's when I make 'em panic, I don't really understand it (Eh-eh)
That's when I lay 'em down and try to get a better view (View)
Genuinely see the way I regularly chew (Chew)
Wack all 'em bitch, I'm from the legendary few (Few)
Some are frumpin', I don't know if they already knew (Uh)
Instead of tryna front, you need to get a better crew (Uh huh)
Lactose, bitch, I keep a MAC close
Better know I pack toast, I don't wanna let it go (Ooh)
Damn folks, now they wanna stand close
Every time I bang, those cannons and they blow, are you ready or not?

Bang, everybody, if you step up in the party
And we do it, are you ready or not?
Flyin' like a rocket, ain't nobody else can stop it
I'll be movin', are you ready or not?
Watch the way we kill 'em and you know we gonna get 'em
And hit 'em then, are you ready or not?
Tell me if you're ready or not
Show me if you're really ready or not

// Somebody Else //

[Jorja Smith:]
Did you notice?
Did you find mistakes I made?
The times I tried, did you realize?
To let you go from me
The miles of things we've had
A thousand times
That you don't understand my, understand me
What the hell am I doin' here?
What the hell am I waitin' for?
Why did I take more than I can bear?
Don't you feel? Never holdin' on
'Cause you still wasn't worth it
What the hell are we doin' here?
What the hell are you waitin' for?
Where'd you call? Are you with my friends?
No distant love

Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? Oh
Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? How?

[Lil Durk:]
Love like rock, paper, scissors, willin' to cut you off
And if I ain't fall in love with you, I wouldn't fuck you soft (Yeah, yeah)
Me and her fightin' through the days, it throw my focus off (Yeah, yeah)
The media treat me like I ain't The Voice and I'm below the blogs
Life's too dangerous at twenty-two, I can't ignore her calls
I called her a "bitch" the other day, she say she no one's dog (I'm sorry)
She say she a stay-at-home mom, that's the perfect job
And I ain't gon' lie to the world, she workin' hard (Hard)
Like how you fall in love with somebody else? (How you fall in love?)
And if I even like a picture, I be on somebody's couch (Yeah)
Somebody's bed, somebody's house (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Instead of fixin' her hair, you was kickin' me out (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, but I'm different (But I'm different)
How you mad I'm from the trenches? (Oh, oh)
And I don't care about bitches (Oh, oh)
Allah, my witness (Oh, oh)

[Jorja Smith (Lil Durk) {Both}:]
Oh, hi, I found, I found somebody else, someone else (How you in love?)
Why you have to be in love with somebody else? Oh
Oh, hi, I found, I found {somebody else}, someone else (Someone else)

Somebody else, somebody else, somebody else
Oh

From all that I can, and all that you are
Make me feel good, takin' me far
From all that I can, you're all that I know (Alright)

You're a hell of a woman, straight up out of dreams
When you say you love me, tell me what you mean
To havin' hope, kiss me 'til we gettin' old
Girl, take it low, blow it like a whistle, oh

You that thang that I crave (Crave)
It's been a hell of a wonderful day (Day)
I guess I'm gettin' the things that I prayed for
Love when you have it your way (Way)

Lookin' at my Rolex, think I need some more sex

My whole life's new, I've been tryna get with you
Now I finally found you and I'm overwhelmed
Oh, well, keep it quiet, don't tell

[Latto:]
Tell me how you want it, baby, I could put it down
First thing in the morning, wake you up and work you out
Livin' in the moment, enjoy while it's yours
Cold-hearted, tryna solve it with these heated floors
Feel like the world is mine for the takin'
I won't worry about what I was givin', I knew what I could make it, oh, baby
Askin' about my past life, but it's the past right
Give him somethin' to act right, and make a nigga act, uh

This the G-double-O-D life
Now sit back, relax and just vibe, come on, come on

If you wanna do bumps, go to the bathroom
I would let you ride in the whip if I had some room
Only way to give up my one heart is if I had two (Had two, yeah)
Hit it like I'm makin' love, felt like I had to

Waitin', ain't payin' no bills
Nobody asked how you feel
Don't do what you do with me with them (Nobody)
Lean on me but keep it chill
Gotta get to the check, it's my calling (Yeah)
Smashin' you is hard without falling
GLE coupe looks like a dolphin (Yeah)
Dashin' from the bank, money followin'

Maybe there'll come a day when we can all win (Yeah)
Diamonds on my bitch 'cause she flawless

Falling, falling
Falling, falling, oh
Falling, oh, falling, oh
Falling, falling, yeah, oh
Falling, yeah, falling, oh
Falling, falling, yeah

Waitin', ain't payin' no bills
Nobody asked how you feel
Don't do what you do with me with them (Nobody)
Lean on me but keep it chill
Gotta get to the check, it's my calling (Yeah)
Smashin' you is hard without falling
GLE coupe looks like a dolphin (Yeah)
Dashin' from the bank, money followin'

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

// Day One //

[Pharrell Williams:]
Men too young to drive cars
Back of my scooter you ride
Girbaud in black and white zombas
Countin' stars in the night
Honeybuns with extra frost
Man, our parents would fight
Teenage years we would question
Kiss while listenin' to Tribe
They don't understand us
You're the only one that'll stand up
Put your hand up
Even when I don't have a plan, but
You with me, you get me
And when my heart get broken, you fix me
No one compare
Day one, you were there

There's some shit on them days that just won't let up
That only you'll offer to do
'Cause I forget, I always feel so much better
After I talk to you
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one)
After you locked up, fuck what they talkin' 'bout

[Pusha T:]
I don't chase them, I replace them
Hunnid dollar bills' like a drink, I waste them
Favorite dope boys are the ones, they traced him
King Push been around the world, might Ma$e them
Spinnin' like there's ten of me, shootin' at my frenemies
Dirty money, let it spin dry 'til we Kennedys
Let's talk symmetry, his and hers Patek, light flex for our energy
Wish I could go back and just talk to beginner me
Of how I should invest what I spent on the shimmery
No regrets, baguettes is blushing
Gosha on the sweats, all in Russian
Click, clack, means no discussion, oh
Who you know chart number one like Bruno?
Still tip the scale like sumo
Erase you out your spot like Pluto
Got love for all my day unos

[Pharrell Williams:]
There's some shit on them days that just won't let up

'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
'Cause you my day one (Day one), day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one)
After you locked up, fuck what they talkin' 'bout
