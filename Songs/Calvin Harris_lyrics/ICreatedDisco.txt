And smoke stuff outside of my house

// Colours //

Yeah
Uh, uh, uh

Now I don't care what you dress like or what you wear
But please make sure, baby, you've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out in black and white
But you're no girlfriend of mine if you're doing that right

Now I don't care what you dress like or what you wear
But please make sure, baby, you've got some colours in there
Now it's all very well stepping out in black and white
But you're no girlfriend of mine if you're doing that right

Get some colours on
Get some colours on

// The Girls //

I like them black girls, I like them white girls
I like them Asian girls, I like them mixed-race girls
I like them Spanish girls, I like them Italian girls
I like the French girls, and I like Scandinavian girls
I like them tall girls, I like them short girls
I like them brown-haired girls, I like them blonde-haired girls
I like them big girls, I like them skinny girls
I like them carrying a little bitty weight girls

Now, baby (Baby)

Now, maybe (Maybe)
I can learn to settle down one day
But right now
I'm living life to mess around and play
See you've got (You've got)
A little thing I haven't seen before

// Neon Rocks //

Sparking up my neon rocks
Pulling out inside pink socks
Sorry, 'cause I'm already home
I'll get rid of this on my own, oh
Dropping stuff, I'm in my car
You won't tell me who you are
Stop me if I've said it before
I keep my secret stash in the drawer, oh-oh-oh

// I Created Disco //

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating disco

Well it was the mid 70s
I was a virtually unknown producer at the time
And I, I was conducting various sonic experiments
With the assistance of Mary, my wife

Anyway during one session I discovered that
By using a succession of techniques
I, I actually developed during the war
I could create an entirely new genre of music
And that was the night I created disco

I created disco

Would you just like to tell us
How you began creating
Disco, disco, disco, disco, disco

// Disco Heat //

Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

// Love For You //

Yeah. Yeah

Now would you stop me if I'm right?
I think about it every night
I've been in fashion from the start
I've been unselfish with my heart
And if I've been around the world
Met a million different girls
You'd still be in with half a chance
If you were born in the eighties
The eighties

I've got love for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
I've got hugs for you if you were born in the eighties
The eighties
