I can't believe it, every day and every night (Bounce)
Is getting better with you out of my life (Bounce)
It's like I flicked a switch, and now I'm feeling good (Bounce)
No way to stop it, now you wish that you could
When the weekend comes, I know I feel alive (Bounce)
You will be the last thing on my mind (Bounce)
No regrets, do you know what that means?

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back
I can love again tonight
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
Hands to the sky, and throw your head back

Bounce
Bounce
Bounce

Well, it's hot, it's loud, it's wild
We bounce to this track
And I don't care what anybody thinks about that
I don't care what anybody thinks about that

// Feel So Close //

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

I feel so close to you right now
It's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve, like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surrounds me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
And there's no stopping us right now
I feel so close to you right now

// We Found Love //

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine)

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

// We'll Be Coming Back //

We took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

// Iron //

I love the way I feel
Streets replaced with fields
Wide awake in here, you shine
I ran away from goals
Left you in the cold
Nothing's in our way tonight

You know that you'll never be replaced
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me
And either way, our time won't go to waste
Our hearts will never be the same again
Our hearts will never be the same again

Our hearts will never be the same again

// I Need Your Love //

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free

// Drinking From The Bottle //

I-I-I-I-I-I-I could pay for everything that's on you (Yeah)
So everything is on me (Woo)
Got them girls going Cyndi Lauper
Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you're in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy? You're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass, just bottles
And I'm buying everybody one each

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

Yeah, I was done with staying, getting it wrong (Yeah)
Then everything is alright (Woo)
Got them girls going Heidi Klum
The Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you're in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you're not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothing
Just keep the bottles coming all night

Yeah, so bring the Veuve Clicquot
D about to hit the big three-oh
Party like it's Carnival in Rio
Life's too short, Danny DeVito
Yo, we live, we die
We give, we try
We kiss, we fight
All so we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here, busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model, the next top model
The next top, next top
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

// Sweet Nothing //

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'

And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Nothing

Whoa, whoa, whoa, sweet nothin' (whoa)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, sweet nothin' (whoa)

// Here 2 China //

Yeah (Getting it in from here to China)
Yo
Aight, let me just kill this right now, quickly

Super trippy, riding through the gritty inner city
Roll with the committee, handle your business or handle the pity
All I see is arse and titties
And a bunch of hippie chicks that's ready to show me tricks
They're doing the splits, I'm all up in the mix
A choir out the mist, I'm taking trips
I'm in a Ferrari looking sick
I'm in a Ferrari looking slick and letting the engine rip
And gettin' the tyre a-grippin', a-slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up, I'm vibing
Now I'm flying, Lord, strike me if I'm lying
I ain't perfect, but I'm trying
Going Super Saiyan, buying anything that catches my eye
'Cause I'm a provider, getting it in from here to China
It's so minor, I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger, I'm ready to blaze the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires
Blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired, putting the pressure on the back tyres
Making a hasty get away
Having a better day in every way than yesterday
I guess there's nothing left to say

Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)

Yo, yo
Wind in my face, chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of Js, looking like I've just been paid
Stupid, I don't play no games, switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames, simple and plain, no, I can't be contained
Plus, I'm raw and untamed, I'm so far from mundane
Getting ghost is my aim, I suggest you do the same
Taking a trip out to Spain with my girl Mary Jane
And she stays on my brain, life's a big gravy train
Paparazzi on my case, giving chase
Cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space, gotta pick up the pace
Singing Amazing Grace
I'm in an amazing place with crazy peeps
I ain't like them other lazy apes, I used to blaze the tapes
So now I stay, hoping for my break, making no mistakes
Now I'm rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate, we just get on with it
You brothers are constipated and your shit is overrated
You should save it

Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (Getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (F-F-F-From here to China)

// Let's Go //

Uh
Let's go
Uh

Make no excuses now
I'm talking here and now (Here and now)
I'm talking here and now
Let's go
Your time is running out
I'm talking here and now (Here and Now)
I'm talking here and now

It's not about what you've done
It's about what you're doing
It's all about where you're going
No matter where you've been
Let's go

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Ooh, let's go

There is no better time
I'm talking here and now (Here and now)
I'm talking here and now
Let's go
Right now is where you shine
I'm talking here and now (Here and now)
I'm talking here and now

It's not about what you've done
It's about what you're doing
It's all about where you're going
No matter where you've been
Let's go

Let's go
Let's go

Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight
Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight

Let's make it happen
Ooh, let's make it happen tonight

Let's go
Let's go
Ooh, let's go
Let's go
Ooh, let's go

// Thinking About You //

If I told you that this couldn't get better, baby
And your heartbeat, it lets me know you feel the same
I can hold you, keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worried, 'cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you'll say

I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you

In a moment, I know that everything could change
And I know that my life would never be the same
But you're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes, you're the one I see
There's no other way I could ever be without you, babe

Now everything I do is all for loving you
It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'll do anything you want me to
Like any other day, I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you'll say

I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
I'll be thinking 'bout you
