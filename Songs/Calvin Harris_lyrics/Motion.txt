// Faith //

I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

I need a little space in my mind
I need that little hope I can find
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need to feel my soul come alive
I need to feel the strength to get by
I need a little, I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
I need a little faith
Is that too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?
Too much to ask for?

// Under Control //

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

I might be anyone
A lone fool out in the sun
Your heartbeat of solid gold
I love you, you'll never know

When the daylight comes you feel so cold,
You know
I'm too afraid of my heart to let you go

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

Waiting for the fire to light
Feeling like we could do right
Be the one that makes tonight
'Cause freedom is a lonely road
We're under control

We're under control

// Blame //

Can't be sleeping, keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning, inside, I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it? I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
Oh, I had no choice in this, I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Oh, I'm so sorry, so sorry, baby, yeah
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I will be better this time
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
Ooh, I got to say
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)
I'm so sorry, oh, I promise
(Oh, I promise I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Love Now //

We must bear our souls, souls, souls
Let the fate we fight take hold, hold, hold
Baby, when you come real close, close, close
It's alright 'cause I am whole

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

We can tiptoe 'round our dreams, dreams, dreams
Just to crash through reality, yeah
I won't spend eternity
Hoping this time I'll be free, free

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weigh up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

// Outside //

Look at what you've done
Stand still, falling away from me
When it takes so long
Fire's out, what do you want to be?

Now I'm holdin' on
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

So, you give me no reason
For me to stay close to you
Tell me what lovers do
How are we still breathing?
It's never for us to choose
I'll be the strength in you

Now I'm holding on (I'm holding on)
Myself was never enough for me
Gotta be so strong
There's a power in what you do
Now, every other day I'll be watching you

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

I'll show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
I'll show you what it feels like

Show you what it feels like
Now I'm on the outside
We did everything right
Now I'm on the outside

// It Was You //

It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you're changing my way, baby
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you

One, two, three, go

It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Oh, you're changing my way, baby
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you
Got me, babe
And it was you
Who's changed my way
It was you

One, two, three, go

// Summer //

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turn brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turn brown

And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

Summer

When I met you in the summer
(Summer)
(Hey)
(Love)
(Hey)

Summer
(Summer)
(Hey)
(Love)
(Hey...)

// Ecstasy //

Fall back and touch the night
And reach for the blinding light
'Cause everybody says that we're too young to see
We know that we're brave enough to be

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Break through from the other side
And lead me to paradise
'Cause nothing but love can take us away from here
Every time I close my eyes, we disappear

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh
Ooh ooh, eh eh

In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me
In a state of ecstasy
In the place we're meant to be
In a state of ecstasy
There is only you and me

// Pray To God //

Oh, I remember when this world was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
And more
I lost the feeling but I try to hold on
I thought the end of a loving one made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore

When there's no getting through
I won't hold back
I will throw down everything in life, I know now
I've been lyin' on the floor
Sleeping on the ground
I will give up everything in life, I know how

Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you

Oh, when the moon was shining bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinin' bright to come and bring me back home
The lights in my eyes, they disappeared
The visions in my mind about to keep me from fear
I won't let it hold me down
The other way around
I don't want the words to, I can't make a sound

Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands up
I'd look up to the sky

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you

Can't hold back
Reachin' out
(Ha ha) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
Between us
I told you that
(Ha ha) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Ha ha) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Ha ha) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give in
(Ha ha) I was livin' in the heat in the moment
I'd give into to you
Give into you

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you

And give in
I'd give in
I'd give in
I'd give into you
Give into you

// Open Wide //

Oh, God!
Whoa

Lookin' at your last text
Damn, did you even really mean it?
Did you even look through it, did you even read it? (What)
I've been breakin' up with girls since I was fifteen
It's the only thing that hasn't got easier (Whoa)
A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
Goddamn, now look at everything in between us
I mean I'm sayin' I got more liquor, more ladies
More drugs and no cases with jobs and no babies
I hope no phone's taping, if so, you gon' hate me

When you see me standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses
Water to champagne fountains
Turn flat chests into mountains
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is
Let me see how big your mouth is

Goin' hard 'til I OD
I'm the newest version of the old me
All my exes are on me
Wishin' they could X and O me (Know it)
I'm on the edge and I'm hangin' all off (Whoa)
On the ledge and we danglin' off (Oh)
And if I let go, I won't fall off
If we set a wedding date, don't call off (No)
Bartender, I call the shots
We call for shots, y'all call the cops
Sometimes drinks speak louder than words do (Uh-huh)
Body language speaks louder than verbal

And we standing on the couches
Turnin' clubs into houses (What)
Water to champagne fountains (God)
Turn flat chests into mountains (Oh, God)
And ooh, I love that ass
But I hate that fuckin' outfit (I do)
I'm takin' off her blouses
While she takin' off my trousers
That's just a couple more problems
To add to the couples counselin' (Oh, now)
Now open that shit wide
Let me see how big your mouth is (Oh)
Let me see how big your mouth is

This goes out to, uh
You know who this goes out to
Ha-ha, yeah
(Hey!)

// Together //

Always running from what feels right
Too fast and I didn't know
Then I'm in a toast to daylight
You're here, no way to let go
Don't look back when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

I got something and it feels right
What I needed to be, can't control what you feel for me
I was watching you the whole night
I can never explain how the magic was made
Don't look back when you're holding me
'Cause I know what this love was meant to be

One day, we're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here together
And it feels so good in my arms
We're gonna wake up together
You won't wanna go home
We'll find love here forever
'Cause we'll wake up together

One day you won't wanna go home
And it feels so good in my arms
You won't wanna go home
'Cause we wake up together

// Burnin' //

This one's for all the bouncers

This one's for all the bouncers

// Dollar Signs //

Dollar signs
Said, "Fuck this shit," you know what's on my mind
Stay on your hustle, you be on your grind
Rip out your heart and left it on the line
You running out of time
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You lose your mind, you lose your fuckin' mind
You close your eyes, you're seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs
Dollar signs

Dollar signs
I told you once, ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game, I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what you like, what you like
Feeling like running away
Stressing 'bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go, fuck 'em away
Everything ain't what it seems
If it's all just a dream
I believe it, I believe it

People searching for answers
While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
Dollar signs

Love is something vicious
Still, it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Meet me in the middle
Underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight
No chill, no chill, no
Got no chill tonight

While the world's spinning faster
They say love is the answer
All you see is dollar signs
