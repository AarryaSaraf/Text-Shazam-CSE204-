Album: ReadyForTheWeekend

// The Rain //

She's the type of girl that makes you feel better
It don't matter how you used to feel
She's the kinda girl that follows good weather
And the sun brings out her sex appeal

If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright

How do you think I can make you feel better?
How do I know what you say is real?
Writing an imaginary love letter
Talking mostly 'bout her sex appeal

If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright

These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright

// Ready For The Weekend //

[Calvin Harris:]
"Counterfeit, counterfeit," that's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this end amicably
Lick the blood stain from your finger, say, "What do you see?"
Remind you that whatever you get is what you want it to be
(You want it to be)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, "Get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today."
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

[Mary Pearce:]
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

[Calvin Harris:]
Coming back, coming back to a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders, but I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight, you fall out of view
(You fall out of view)

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there's not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, "Get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today."
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

[Mary Pearce:]
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Ooh, I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

// Stars Come Out //

Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, power to the mind's museum
Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain

If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out

Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain

If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out

Lying in the grass

// You Used To Hold Me //

Knocked down, everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I know this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah, me, yeah
Me, me, me, yeah
You know better than I do

Knocked down, everything I tried to do
That sounds something like me holding you
I know this can make you understand
Take my spirit from my open hand

You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me
You used to hold me, me, me, me, yeah
You used to hold me, you used to hold me

// Blue //

I've got to stop waiting for you
And move onto someone new
But everything around me is blue
The colour that reminds me of you
I've got to stop looking back
My head can get lost off track
And I know that you're not coming back
But, Lord, I wish you would now

I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop-bought
I'm looking happy but I'm not
No I'm not, no, my baby
I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop-bought
I'm looking happy but I'm not
No, no, no, oh

When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue

I've got to stop waiting for you
And move onto someone new
But everything around me is blue
The colour that reminds me of you
I've got to stop looking back
My head can get lost off track
I know that you're not coming back
But, Lord, I wish you would now

When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue

// I'm Not Alone //

Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No

If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that I'm not alone? No

// Flashback //

[Calvin Harris:]
I'm coming 'round and now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind, then I would disappear
The love I get from you is something I can't chance
And I could let you slip away without a second glance

Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa

[Ayah:]
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback

[Calvin Harris:]
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa
Why can't I realise I'm fighting for my life?
Whoa, whoa

[Ayah:]
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory
This is like a flashback, this is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit inside a memory

// Worst Day //

[Izza Kizza:]
Must be the worst day of my life
Izza Kizza, girl

[Calvin Harris:]
My first mistake was letting you into my life
Yes, it was
My second mistake was allowing you into my bed
Laying in my bed
My third mistake was loving you more than I should
Though I really should know better
My fourth mistake was sitting with you
While you're telling me that you can't do this anymore

This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

I'm walking home and listening to MP3s
Just how did I let you decide to destroy me?
I'm missing you, it crossed my mind that a heart will bleed
The love that I have left behind is gonna finish me
It's one of those days

[Calvin Harris (Izza Kizza):]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
('Cause it's the worst day of my life)
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
(Girl, Izza Kizza)
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

[Izza Kizza:]
See, yesterday, I called her back
The day before, I called her flat
It ain't working, break my neck
Still, it ain't cut me my cheque
A week ago, I did my thing
Three o' clock, I missed my train
Tomorrow, I thought we could chill
There won't be us, you won't, I will
The moral of the story like I told my cousin Corey
You see, Cupid, he will stab you in the back like Jason Voorhees
So he's got smoking me cigarettes and got me drinkin' 40s
And the doctor said, "Take two of these
And call me in the morning"
It's the worst day

[Calvin Harris & Izza Kizza:]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
And it's true 'cause all I wanna do is be by your side

[Izza Kizza:]
Yeah, writing's on the wall
Got no heart, no soul, no control

[Calvin Harris:]
This must be the worst day of my life
This must be the worst day of my life
My life

// Relax //

Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax
Relax

Relax
I've come away with a panic attack
The spinning lights make it hard to react
Catch your breath, take your furniture back

Relax
I've got the coat and the jackets to match
We can replace everything that you lack
Take a book and a nicotine patch

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax
Relax
Relax

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

It's for the taking
All these girls are waiting
Love's not God forsaking
And that's worth celebrating

Relax

// Limits //

And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm lookin' twice at you, girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

But now suddenly, I don't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you
It's not good for me, I can't find the time to see you
Become close to me, and then act like I don't know you

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

And it starts with the beat of a drum, far away
I took a chance with your mind, I've come to play
I get the buzz from your girl, I buzz away
In my car, in my house and my babe today
I never wanted to stand the loving game
I write your name on my hand to fan the flame
I'm lookin' twice at you, girl, we're not the same
And if we fight, you're the one to blame

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

Keep spending limits of my life
Trying to keep up with my friends
Trying to keep up with my friends

// Yeah Yeah Yeah La La La //

Stop being a bad joke
It's not the same
Feeling that sunshine
And forgetting the rain
It feels so peaceful
Without the rain
Your life's got happy
You got on the TV

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

Being with each other
We're having fun
I've got something special
I might find the one
We dig each other
And break the rules
We love one another
And that's no fool

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

I take a piece of paper
And write your name
You put it in your pocket
And I did the same
We love each other
And that's for sure
I live here without you
I can't take it no more

Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la (My girl)
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la
Yeah yeah yeah, la la la, la la la la

// Dance Wiv Me //

[Chrome:]
Oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Come and dance with me

[Dizzee Rascal:]
What's up, darlin'?
I been keeping my eye on your movement
I can't see no room for improvement
Why you all over there on your Jack Jones?
You need to let me get behind your backbone
'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it
I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it
One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect
You got a body to die for, let me merk it
Now it's murder on the dance floor
I wanna take this further than the dance floor
I ain't forceful but I'm still hardcore
You're gonna give me everything I ask for
It's not a long ting, you're the boom ting
Maybe more than a hotel room ting
I'll never know if I just walk past
I really wanna dance, so I guess I'll just ask

[Chrome:]
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul

[Dizzee Rascal:]
Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, come dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Calvin Harris:]
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me

[Dizzee Rascal:]
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Dizzee Rascal:]
Yo, it goes on and on
I see you get excited like this is my song
You think I wanna get involved, you are not wrong
'Cause I been waiting for this moment all night long
So I creep, creep, creep like TLC
I got my left eye checking out your scenery
I got my right eye right where it needs to be
Don't matter how I look at it, you look good to me
Still, I'm looking for the perfect view
The way I see it, that's right next to you
I know you've probably heard it before but still
I love it when you flex like that for real
So don't stop doing what you do when you do it
I just wanna be a part of it when you do it
I'll feel like a wally if I don't pursue it
And I can't go through it, so let's get to it

[Chrome:]
She ain't no ho
Look at those thighs, it's in her eyes, she's good to go
She can satisfy my mind, body and soul

[Dizzee Rascal:]
Come and dance with me, come and dance with me
Come and dance with me, come dance with me
I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B
So let's party, B, come and dance with me

[Dizzee Rascal:]
I know you didn't come out to stand and stare
You bought new shoes and you did up your hair
You made a real effort tonight and it shows
I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone
'Cause the mood is right and the time is now
And if you can't do it, I'll show you how
All you gotta do is get loose, let go
Just throw a couple shapes, put your skills on show, oh
Put your skills on show

[Calvin Harris (Dizzee Rascal):]
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
(I see you glance at me, that's why I'm asking, B)
(So let's party, B, come and dance with me)
If I'm out on my own, then I can look at you looking at me
If I'm out on a date, then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see
Get away from the bar, tell your boyfriend hold your jar
And dance with me
