// 5 AM //

Tryna live my life any way I like it
Never let a simp' nigga mess up my eye lid
Something 'bout your eyes, they hit me by surprise, shit
Feelin' hella sprung, if you with it then you got it 
I've been waitin' up, nothin' on but your chain now
Filling up the tub. What's the scent of the day now?
Boy you can't resist it, boy you know you miss it
Can we find a way?

5 AM. I can't eat right, I can't sleep right
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night, and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
Yeah I need it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby

5 AM, and I want you, baby
5 AM, and I want you, baby

What you tryna play, boy? You know I'm ready
I'm like a buffet, body's yours for the taking
Almost done for breakfast, tell me you gon' make it
Hungry, hungry boy, you'll be begging for the bacon

Practicing my tricks. I got plenty
Throw one down right now if you'd let me
Tell me what you like
Ride if you ready, ride if you ready, ride if you ready

5 AM. I can't eat right, I can't sleep right
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night, and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
Yeah I need it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby

5 AM, and I want you, baby
5 AM, and I want you, baby

'Cause it's 5 AM, 5 AM. I can't eat right, I can't sleep right
Won't do anything without you
Can't do anything without you

5 AM. I can't eat right, I can't sleep right
I can't do anything without you
I've been running from you all night, and now it feel like
I can't do anything without you
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
Yeah, I need it, baby
Want you, I want you, babe
I want it, baby

5 AM, and I want you, baby
5 AM, and I want you, baby

// By Your Side //

When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning
Darling I'll be by your side

When you get a little lonely
And you lose your rhythm, don't give up the fight
When you wake up in the morning
I'll be by your side (I'll be by your side)

When you wake up in the morning
And you're shadowed by the darkness of the night
When you wake up in the morning
Darling I'll be by your side

I'll be there by your side
I'll be everything you wanted
I'll be there, by your side
If you need a light, just shine it
I'll be there!

Oh-oh
(Darkness of the night!) Oh-oh
(I'll be by your side!) Oh

So lift your hand 'cause you know that you can
There'll be fire again in the dark-ark
Hold out your hand, let the stars shoot again
Let the light shine in through the dark
And I'll be there!

And I'll be there
I'll be by your side
And I'll be there
I'll be by your side (Hey)

// Giant //

[Rag'n'Bone Man]
I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on the table for your unrequited love
Well, I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotions, you can throw down your guard
And feed from the notion we can be who we are
You taught me something, yeah, freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet

// Miracle //

When you hold me
There's a place I go
It's a different high
Oh no
When you touch me
I get vulnerable
In a different light
Oh no

Are you too cynical
To believe in a miracle
That just slipped through my hands
But could you take a chance for me?
Can you forgive it all
To believe in a miracle?
Yeah, I put you through hell
But I'm asking you to believe
To believe in a miracle

// My Way //

Why wait to say, at least I did it my way
Lie awake, two faced
But in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

You were the one thing in my way

You were the one thing in my way
You were the one thing in my way

You were the one thing in my way

My way, oh way, oh way, oh way

But in my heart I understand
I made my move and it was all about you
Now I feel so far removed

You know you play the victim every time

Your girls ain't shit, tryna get me off your mind
The same ones who be hittin' up my line

I don't regret those memories
And I swear I'm not tryna test

But you always need that attention
Feedin' the press, when we don't speak
But we're both with somebody else
So please stop callin' me

// Slow Down //

[Normani:]
Oh, oh
Everybody slow down
Everybody, everybody slow down
Everybody be on the low down
And it's cool if you wanna be slow now, no doubt
Remember that night at your old house?
Remember that time that you broke down?
Saying that you're happy, that you dropped that chain
Knowing that I'm the one to hold down

Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne, 'cause you cut other girls off
And I make it, make it, pop like soda
And you make it, make it, then dose off
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking

Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, love me, I'm right here I
I can make your lonely disappear I
I could, could you just be real?
Could you just be real?

Ain't nobody home now
Ain't nobody, ain't nobody home now
Everybody be on that night life flow
When I exit the club, so they putting on a show now, no doubt
I ain't tryna move like a dummy
I'm tryna move real so you trust me
I'm tryna show you that other people try
But it's better when you touch me

Champagne, I took all your clothes off
Champagne and I'm missing all my phone calls
Swimming in your bed like be like
Fucking to a slow jam, I'm rocking your boat now
I'm still a kid and, I'm stealing your time
But I still feel your heart, so I'm asking

Could you just be real?
Don't be scared to feel this
We can make the world go still
Could you let me feel this?
You can risk it, love me, I'm right here, I
I can make your lonely disappear, I
I could, could you just be real?
Could you just be real?

Could you just be real?
Real, real
Could you just be real?
Could you just be, could you just be

// Summer (R3hab & Ummet Ozcan Remix) //

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

Just drop the bass

When I met you in the summer (Summer)
To my heartbeat's sound (Yeah, yeah)
We fell in love (Love)
As the leaves turned brown (Yeah, yeah)
And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue (Yeah, yeah)
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon (Yeah, yeah)
When I met you in the summer

Just drop the bass

// The Weekend (Funk Wav Remix) //

You say you got a girl
How you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless
Of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by
10: 30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9-to-5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9-to-5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

// This Is What You Came For //

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

We go fast with the game we play (Game we play, game we play)
Who knows why it's gotta be this way (Be this way, be this way)
We say nothin' more than we need (Than we need, than we need)
I say, "Your place" when we leave

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
Yeah

Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watchin' her
But she's lookin' at
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, you, ooh, ooh, ooh
