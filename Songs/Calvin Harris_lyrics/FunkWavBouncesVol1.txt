And whatever comes, comes through clear

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part,
We see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charms,
Yeah
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

We gon' light up and burn up, burn up
Mama too hot like a, like what?

My diamonds gonna shine when the lights dark, shine
You and I'll take a ride down the boulevard, yeah
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good Lord

[Offset:]
(Offset)
Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out the spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia (info)
You my baby,
The paparazzi flashin' crazy (Flash)
She swallowed the bottle while I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion. 20 thousand paintings. Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Ricardo (Flash)
She havin' it
Went to college, workin' on her bachelor (College)
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'mma make a million on the average (Ms)
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it (Skrrt)

[Khalid:]
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85

They deserve Whammy's, they imposters
I be rollin' with my project homies, it's a vibe
I just did some pills with the homie, it's a vibe
Bend her over, switch sides, it's a vibe, yah

I come through with strippers and some shottas
I gotta accept that I'm a monster
I pull up in several different options
Not all, but most of 'em came topless
I'll shatter your dreams with this cream I make (Cream I make)
Gotta be on codeine to think of shit I say (Shit I say)
I can't feel my toes and ain't gon' fold up (Fold up)
I was in the double R when I rolled up (When I rolled up)

[Khalid:]
I feel like I should be giving up
You can leave if it's too much
But I'm tired of you leading me on, oh no
I don't like where this shit is going
I mean I've been stuck in all your apologies
Gave my all but you want more from me
Keep your love, it doesn't feel the same
I hope it hurts you when you're hearin' my name

[Pharrell Williams:]
Hey!
No-nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Katy Perry:]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

[Pharrell Williams:]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh

[Big Sean:]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'mma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Katy Perry & Big Sean:]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)

// Faking It //

[Kehlani:]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like He's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else (Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself, ay (Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar (Guess I am)
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it (Yeah)
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it? (Over it)
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it? (Oh, oh)
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Lil Yachty:]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gon' act like I don't love ya, baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (True)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (No!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (Yah)
I 'member all of them times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front
You're a stone cold diva (Yah)
Had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (Oh yeah)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you
Every single time I eat pizza, oh-oh-oh

[Kehlani:]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it? (Why you, why you, why you, why you?)
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it? (Holding it)

// Hard To Love //

(Oh-ooh-oh-whoa)

[Jessie Reyez:]
I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a fiend
But then I pull out, and say
"I need freedom, I need freedom"
(Whoa-whoa)

I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Oh, baby, I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (Listen)
I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me (Yeah)

'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen (Oh-ooh-oh-whoa)
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick despite all I showed ya
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Oh, baby, I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me, yeah (Woo!)
I'd rather be hard to love than easy to leave
You should believe me, I'll make you need me

Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper, go deep (Yeah)
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (Woo!)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (Listen)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real (Whoa, whoa)
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

Go deeper (Whoa, yeah, yeah)
Go deeper (Go now, go now)
(I know you know what I'm talking about)

Go deeper
Go deep
Oh my God, that feels nuts on its own
That shit feels like fucking
That shit feels like, that shit feels like some ego tripping shit (Woo)
Mm
