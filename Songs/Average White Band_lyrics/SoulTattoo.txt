// Soul Mine //

Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine

You make me work, just love to see me sweat
The hotter baby, the rougher that it gets
You're a heart's stopper, you must be made of stone
Sometimes I swear I wish, you'd leave me alone

It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
Working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Can I have some fun, yeah

You make it seem, you're having fun when I hurt
I'm like a dog, just digging in the dirt
Sometimes I think you don't know what you're doing to me
Back on my knees, got a mind to set me free

It's like working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
When can I have some fun

Working in a soul mine
Working in a soul mine

Believe me baby, I don't wanna be this way
You bring me trouble girl, what more can I say
Give me soul, blood and roll, my fingers to the bone
Give me back my soul babe, I wanna take my spirit home

I'm working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
I gotta have some fun

It's like working in a soul mine
Just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
Till the day is done
It's like working in a soul mine
I just can't work no harder
Working in a soul mine
I gotta have some fun

// Back To Basics //

Well it's all right, it's all right

Living hard, living fast in the city
There's got to be a way to make it slow down
Doing what we do, is human nature
That's the way it goes
It gets so hard, trying to make a living
We've got to give the love back to our brothers
Trying to find some time, for one another
So we know it's for real

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, and just let it go (let it go)

You know at times you get a little crazy
Running round, looking for some direction
On the streets, nothings very simple
But I know it's for real

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, ah, just let it go (let it go)

Nothing matters but, good old fashioned love
Let's just face it, all it takes is basic love

I wanna get back to basics
I wanna get back with you
Back to basics, like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics, just take it slow
Back to basics, ah, just let it go (let it go)

I wanna get back to basics, wanna get back to love
I wanna get back to basics, wanna get back to love
I wanna get back to basics, I wanna get back with you
I wanna get back to basics, baby like we use to do
I wanna get back to basics

// Livin' On Borrowed Time //

Girl, I can't believe it comes to this already
We turned back the hands of time
Always tried to give you love and be real steady
But something else is on your mind
The things you do, the words you say, to keep me guessing
But I just can't give up the fight, no
Sometimes you have to lose a lot to learn a lesson
It's not to late to so what's right

Because we're livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
Livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...

Don't you know that life's too short to second guessing
One last chance to do [?]
So make up your mind [?]

And now we're livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
Livin' on borrowed time
Livin' on borrowed time with you
Livin' on borrowed time, ah...
...

// Every Beat Of My Heart //

Each day goes by, doing all the simple things I must
It takes most all that I have, waiting only for the nights
We'll be together, darling
We know what little time, we have baby
Let's make each minute seem, like it could be our last one alive

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

As daylight comes, the morning steals the shadows from your face
Soon I'll be far on my way, taking along this memory
With me wherever I go, darling
Whatever little time we share, baby
There's not a minute, I don't realize just how much I care

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

Closer to you darling, with every beat of my heart
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

Hold me real close, till I know you can feel every beat of my heart
Turn out the light, let me stay here tonight
Keeping just as we are
Lying beside you, alone in the dark
Brings me closer to you, darling with every beat of my heart

// When We Get Down To It //

Funny how, I was there at the beginning
But you never heard my cry
Reaching out to the ones, who were not giving
They were never on your side

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it babe
You're gonna want the world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing else but love will do
When we get round to it babe
I wanna be down, get down with you girl

Ooh deep down with you
When we get round to it

Can't you see all the chances we've been missing
All the nights that passed us by, baby
Now we're alone, your lips are mine for kissing
No time to wrestle with your pride

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it babe
You're gonna want the world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing else but love will do
When we get proud to it babe
I want to get down, get down with you girl

Oh baby
Oh, it's no ordinary thing that we share
What you give to me, girl
Oh, there's no reason, we should try to hide it
Take love when you find it, oh

When we get down to it
You were meant for me
When we get proud to it, babe
I want the whole wide world to see
When we get down to it
Nothing but love will do
When we get round to it, baby
I want to be down with you
When we get down to it
...

// Do Ya Really //

Baby now, why don't you let me stop
Show you how we have ourselves a good time
Get on up till you drop, I won't make it any secrets
She said "Let it out, and lay it next to mine"

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Move me, do me up, this girl's got juice
She don't know what she's doing to me
My degrees, I believe that this could lead to love
Especially the way she said to me

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Whatever else you might have shaken
You'll be welcome baby, right there by my side
Whatever hearts you might be breaking now baby
My arms are always open wide

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

Do ya really wanna have fun
Come and funk with me baby
Do ya really wanna get high by yourself
Do ya really wanna have fun
Get a jump on it baby
Don't you really wanna just try something else

// I Wanna Be Loved //

(Oh yeah...)

What exactly are you thinking
Let me begin to ease your mind
Whatever the devil pays, for left handed ways
You got to know I'm dealing for my life, ooh yeah
save your love for a minute
Keep all your thoughts on the line
I couldn't begin to live for another day
I wouldn't die for the chance to make you mine

I wanna be loved, ooh yeah
I wanna be, wanna be loved by you
Ooh, I wanna be loved, oh darling
I wanna be loved by you, oh yeah

All the habits of a lifetime
I've been trying hard to make them history
I'm thinking if we got to smooth out the rough spots baby
Say girl "You'd get the best of me"

I wanna be loved, ooh yeah
I wanna be, wanna be loved by you
Ooh, I wanna be loved, oh darling
I wanna be loved by you, oh yeah

Girl if you're with me
You've got to forgive all my past

I wanna be loved...

// No Easy Way To Say Goodbye //

I always thought I'd have the answers
Nothing would get in my way
I always thought we would last forever
Till my love changed
And all the things that were promised
I know I let you slip away
This is the hardest thing I have to say

Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye

Looking for a way to justify it
But coming up short of things to say
I always thought we would stay together
Till my love changed
Maybe if I did you different
Maybe you'd still be in my life
But we both know that I didn't do you right, no

Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
And even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye

Ooh baby...
Ooh... even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye
Even if I find the words, find the way
I just can't come up with one more lie
Even if we tell ourselves it's over
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye
There's no easy way to say goodbye, say goodbye
...

// Love Is The Bottom Line //

My appeal to you
I give you all the love, the love you need
And you know that's hard to find
I give you everything, your heart desires
If it gives you peace of mind

So you say you don't believe
Love is ever guaranteed
That's a feeling I don't buy
Would it make a difference
Won't you give my love a chance
All you got to do is try

You say that love don't mean a thing
When you've got money, you got everything
But that's a song that's out of time
You know that love is the bottom line
It's the bottom line

Now I've been working day and night
What you want don't come for free
But that's the price I pay for loving you
And it really doesn't matter to me

So you say you don't believe
Love is ever guaranteed
That's a feeling I don't buy
Would it make a difference
Won't you give my love a chance
All you got to do is try

You say that love don't mean a thing
When you've got money, you got everything
But that's a song that's out of time
You know that love is the bottom line
It's the bottom line
...

// Welcome To The Real World //

You said love was just a fantasy
Nothing you need in your life
That little weakness in humanity
You never thought you would try
In my experience you must agree
What all the world's trying to find
Only looking for that special someone
To turn the water to wine

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Slipping away
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last

Could it be you've had a change of heart
Even if it's hard to admit
Every day you're getting closer to me
Why must you try to resist

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Through our fingers, baby
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last

Don't get caught up in the words you say
Let your heart show the way, baby

So wake up, look around
Time is slipping through our fingers so fast
Slipping away
If it's love that you've found
Welcome to the real world at last
...

// Window To Your Soul //

Did you ever stop to wonder
What it's like to be on the other side
Looking in on all the things you try to hide
You don't wanna know
Whatever else you take for granted
Don't ever sell yourself short
That ain't fair
I can turn around the mirror in your heart
You'll come to know the one who really cares

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
There's so much more you have to offer me
It's like a stream that's running deep under the ground
If digging deeper helps me bring it to the light
You'll be glad I was around

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Don't try to fight it baby, don't say no

Don't say no, baby
No use denying I hold the key
Just let go, baby
No use in crying when you can lean on me...

They say love can last forever
That means we take the bad, not only the good
Even if sometimes you have a frightened heart
At least you know you'll be understood

Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Getting closer but you won't let go
Tryin' to open a window to your soul
Don't try to fight it baby, don't say no
...

// You Shoulda' Known //

Heard you doubt my love but you know me, you should know better
I belong to you, only you
Girl you got to know if it's up to me we'll be together
For ever and ever

When another girl even looks my way
I let her know that she best be on her way
Don't want to spend my time, don't want to give my love
To no one but you

Girl you shoulda' known, I'll never let you down
Your heart is my home, you're always on my mind
Girl you shoulda' known, this love is on solid ground
You shoulda' known by the look in my eye
You shoulda' known, shoulda' known baby
You shoulda' known, shoulda' known baby

How could you doubt my love, you know me, you should know better
Darlin' I'd be a fool to lose your trust
Ain't nothin' in my life, in this whole world I've come to treasure
The way I do you

So any time that you feel unsure
Look in my eyes that's where you'll find the truth
I wanna fill you up with all the love I feel
And take your worries away

Girl you shoulda' known, I'll never let you down
Your heart is my home, you're always on my mind
Girl you shoulda' known, this love is on solid ground
You shoulda' known by the look in my eye

And when I met you I had a feelin' that we were meant to be
And you were meant just for me
And I'm holding on to what I've found in you...

Shoulda' known...
