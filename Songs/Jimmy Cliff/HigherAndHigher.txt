// Many Rivers To Cross //

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and
I merely survive because of my pride.

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess I have to try.
Many rivers to cross but just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There'll be times I find myself thinking
Of committing some dreadful crime.

I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride.

// Wonderful World, Beautiful People //

Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal

Take a look at the world
And the state that it's in today
I am sure you'll agree
We all could make it a better way
With our love, put together
Everybody learn to love each other

Instead of fussing and fighting
Cheating, backbiting
Scandalizing and hating
Baby we could have a
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal

Man and woman, girl and boy
Let us try to give a helping hand
This I know and I'm sure
That with love we all could understand
This is our world, can't you see?
Everybody wants to live and be free

Instead of fussing and fighting
Cheating, backbiting
Scandalizing and hating
We could have a
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, things could be pretty
But underneath this there is a secret
That nobody can reveal

Talking about the
Wonderful world, beautiful people
You and your girl, talking about you
Things could be pretty, talking about me
Wonderful world, talking about Nixon
Beautiful people, Harold Wilson
Wonderful world, power too
Beautiful people, and the Seagate

// You Can Get It If You Really Want //

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last

Persecution you must fear
Win or lose you got to get your share
You've got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last

I know it - listen

Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the hotter the battle you see
Is the sweeter the victory now

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last

// The Harder They Come //

Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all

Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done

'Cause, as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all

And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
What I say now
What I Say now

What I say now
What I say, one time 
The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all
The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

Your love, lifting me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before
So keep it it up
Quench my desire
And I'll be at your side, forever more

[Chorus]
You know your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

Now once, I was down hearted
Disappointment, was my closest friend
But then you, came and it soon departed
And you know he never
Showed his face again

[Chorus]
That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

[Organ solo]

I'm so glad, I've finally found you
That someone, in a million girls
And I whip, my loving arms around you
I can stand up, and face the world 

[Chorus]
That's why your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
Everyday your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

Lift me up, woman (your love keeps lifting me)
Keeps on lifting (keeps on lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)
I said your love (your love keeps lifting me)
Keep on (keeps on lifting me)
Lifting me (lifting me)
Higher and higher (higher)

// I Can See Clearly Now //

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Oh, yes I can make it now the pain is gone
All of the bad feelings have disappeared
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Look all around, there's nothing but blue skies
Look straight ahead, there's nothing but blue skies

I can see clearly now the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way
Here is that rainbow I've been praying for

It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day

Bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright) bright (bright)
Sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright) bright (bright)
Sunshiny day

Bright (bright)
Bright (bright) sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright) so bright (bright)
Sunshiny day
It's gonna be a bright (bright) bright (bright)
Sunshiny day
