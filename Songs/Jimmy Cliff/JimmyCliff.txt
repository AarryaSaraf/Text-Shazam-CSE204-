// Time Will Tell //

Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

When I was just a little boy only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold
He said, Son, when you grow up to be a man,
The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I want to tell you now, and listen while I sing

Father said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own
Ever since the day I was born, I never have a happy home
Just like the river, I've been running ever since
The day I was born in that broken down little town
I'm wondering now just what my gain will be
'Cause it seems to me, happiness I'll never see

Mama said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

What he say now,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

Time keeps on changing like the weather and the seasons
For every mistake, Mama said, there must be a reason
After a storm, there's got to be a calm
So I think I'll wait a while and try to wear a smile (Wear a smile)

Mama said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

What he say now,
Time will tell - I know, I know!
Time will tell - said I know
Time alone will tell

One more time now
Time will tell - I believe
Time will tell - oh yes, I do!
Time alone will tell - I believe that...

// Vietnam //

Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam

Yesterday, I got a letter from my friend fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
"Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time'll be up some time in June
Don't forget", he said, "To tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips are sweet as cherry"

And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam

It was just the next day, his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
"Don't be alarmed", she told me the telegram said
"But mistress Brown your son is dead"

And it came from Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, hey, Vietnam
Somebody please stop that war now

Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, oh oh, oh oh
Somebody please stop it

Vietnam, Vietnam, oh
Vietnam, Vietnam, oh oh, oh oh
Vietnam, hey, Vietnam, aha
Vietnam, oh oh, yeah

I wanna say now somebody stop that war
Vietnam, oh yeah, aha

// Use What I Got //

I'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah

Look, I was born in a little old shack
Didn't have enough to eat
Not enough clothes on my back
Lord knows I kept the faith
A heart full of woe
Now they're trying to get me
At the end of my road
Use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah

The rich is content
While the poor do without
If you ask for some herb
They don't know what you're talking about
All say they answer
As if they're on the wind
It changes sometimes
That why I'm afraid I've gotta
Use what I got 
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah

The road of life is mighty steep
When you're broke, busted and disgusted
For you ain't got nowhere to sleep
I'm gonna find me a woman to stand by my side
'Cause I'm so tired of running
Can't find no place to hide

I'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
Use what I got, you know that I got to
Use what I got, said I've got to
Use what I got, you gotta use it
Use what I got, use it all up now
Use what I got, yes I have
Use what I got, I've got to, got to
Use what I got, said I got to
Use what I got
Use what I got

// Hard Road To Travel //

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Let me tell you
I'm all alone, this lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh the river gets deeper, the hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper every day, yeah

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Aah, oh oh
Aah, oh oh - one more thing

I dream of a home far beyond the sea
Where there is love and peace and joy for me
Oh, in my eyes I see troubles and dangers for me
But destiny where it leads me I must go, hey

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Aah, oh oh - no, help me somebody
Aah, oh oh - somebody please, help me right now

// Sufferin' In The Land //

Da-da-dai-dai, da-da-dai, da-da-dai ....
Suffering in the land

It is plain to see we're in a terrible situation
Sufferin' in the land
Nearly half of the world on the verge of starvation
Sufferin' in the land
And the children are crying for more education
Sufferin' in the land
Let's singin'

Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer
Sufferin' in the land
Everything's gettin' higher and the time gettin' tougher
Sufferin' in the land
They're making guns and bombs to set the world on fire
Sufferin' in the land
I'm singin'

Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land, Lord
Da-da-dai-dai ....
Suffering in the land

// My Ancestors //

My ancestors were kings of old
They ruled the world and all of its gold
But look at me, oh, look at me
Just look at me

My ancestors would find the sun
Before they bowed down to anyone
But you gonna look at me
Woh, look at me
Just look at me

Yeah, woh, look at me

Watch me stand tall
Help me, help me be just a man, oh

My ancestors, they were mighty men
And my son, he will be one of them
And they'll just look at him
Yeah, they'll look at him
And they'll say, he's a man, he's a man
My son's a man, oh

My ancestors, they passed it on to me
I've got to, got to work
And pass it on to my son
And he will be a man, oh yeah
And pass it on to his son
And he will be a man, oh yes he will

// My World Is Blue //

Five o'clock in the morning
I'm not yet a-sleeping
Soon the day will be dawning
Since I broke up with you
My whole world is through
I'm so blue

I should have not been a-flirting
Now I'm the one who is hurting
And there's just no telling
What I'm gonna do
'Cause life without you is so blue

My world is blue
My world is blue, ooh

Help me mama, help me papa
Can't you see I made a mistake?
I'm only living for a loving
And this heartache, I just can't take
I'm so blue

Five o'clock in the morning
I'm not yet a-sleeping
Soon the day will be dawning
Now since I broke up with you
My whole world is through
I'm so blue

You never miss your water
Until your well runs dry
You never see your tears
And then you start to cry
You break down inside you could die

My world is blue
My world is blue, ooh

Help me mama, help me papa
Can't you see I made a mistake?
I'm only living for a loving
And this heartache, I just can't take
I'm so blue

My world is blue, so blue
I need you, ooh, ooh
Come into my world, girl
Said, I need you
I gotta have you
