// Those Good, Good Old Days //

I can still remember
When we were much younger
Skies were blue and fields were green
oh the air's so clean

Animals ran wild and free
birds could sing in harmony
flowers would grow all around
and Mother Earth was sound

[CHORUS]
In those good good old days
In those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be

Where did all the green fields go
And flowers now that just won't grow
Animals are dying out
That lives north and south

They found out how to crack the skies
Casting shadows on our eyes
Telling us just how to live
And when to die 

[CHORUS]
But those good good old days
yes those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be

Wasting oil upon the sea
That used to be so fresh and free
Poisoned gases everywhere
Stifling the air

And many children lose their way
By leaders of confusion
And leave them with the price to pay 
Of hastened evolution 

[CHORUS]
But those good good old days
In those good good old days
yes those good good old days
That used to be

Talking 'bout those good old days
Talking 'bout those good old good old days
Don't you remember
Try to remember
I'm sure you know
I'm sure you know

// Better Days Are Coming //

Better days are coming by and by
Don't you get down hearted, don't you cry
Troubles will be over, all our joys come over
Better days are coming by and by

Don't you know better days are coming by and by
Don't you get down hearted, don't you cry
Sorrows will be over, all our joys come over
Better days are coming by and by

It can't be this way always
A train must come, a train must come
There must be some brighter days
We'll have fun, we'll have fun, yeah

Better days are coming by and by
Don't you get down hearted, don't you cry
Troubles will be over, all our joys come over
Better days are coming by and by

Things get rough, your friends get few
Don't you cry, don't you cry
Change your flock, we'll come for you
We'll get high, we'll get high, yeah

Better days are coming by and by
Don't you get down hearted, hearted, don't you cry
Troubles will be over, all our joys come over
Better days are coming by and by

Don't you know better days are coming by and by
So don't you get down hearted, don't you cry
Troubles will be over

// Struggling Man //

Every man has a right to live
Love is all that we have to give
Together we struggle by our will to survive
And together we fight just to stay alive

Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man
And I've got to move on

As the sun lights the day and the moon lights the night 
Struggling man keeps reaching for the higher heights
So we plan for tomorrow as we live for today
Like a flower we bloom, and then later fade away

Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man 
And I've got to move on

Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man 
And I've got to move on

Struggling man, struggling man
Struggling man, struggling man
Struggling man, struggling man

// When You're Young //

Be wise, be free when you're young
When you're young

Well, someone told me, not long ago now
You're only young but for once
It's the one time in a lifetime
There is no second chance, second chance

So when you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems

Be wise, be free when you're young
When you're young

It's said, you got your freedom to make your own rules
Be nobody's footstool
And you may try now to change the world too
But don't let it change you, it can't change you

So when you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems

When you're young
When you're young

You see that many a people in my time of mend
Telling tales of regret
Step aside Grandma, step aside Grandpa
There are somethings I must get, I must get

When you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems

When you're young
When you're young
You know it's the right time
You know it's the right time

Said, I know
(When you're young)
Said, I know
(When you're young)
When you're young
When you're young

// Sooner Or Later //

It's getting to the point 
Where I can't hang around no more 
It's getting to the point 
Where really have to open up the door 

Times are changing 
You better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
And you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 

Hear me now! 

Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
Sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for a lucky break 

Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
Or you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 

Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
You sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for the lucky break 

Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 

Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
Or you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late

// Can't Stop Worrying, Can't Stop Loving You //

Who am I talking to it's just myself
I talk to the wall, when I talk with someone else
Only a few, that I met really knew
Why so many good things had so much abuse

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

I've got my dreams about the way it's gonna be
I'd share it all with someone, who is real not make-believe
It sometimes gets hard, to see the wood from the tree
But when things are right, then no questions will I need
That's why I gotta sing, sing

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

[?]

Gonna sing it to you

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

The scenery's changed, but my feelings remain
Laughter and pain and love is still the same
Something worth having doesn't come too easily
A man needs the challenge or a man couldn't be
That's why I gotta sing to you

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

I can't stop from worrying
About the things we do
I can't stop loving
Without it, nothing would seem true

// Can't Live Without You //

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

You've always been beside me
For a moment of my youth
I know deep down inside me
You've always shared the truth

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

We've seen a lot together
Sometimes good but mostly bad
Through every change of weather
You're the only one I've had

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

The dream that we all live in
The plans we try to make
The treasures we are giving
Are more than we can take

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

Baby, I can't live without you
Life is nothing without you
Don't you know?

But life is brief and fickle
And all that starts must end
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

// Going Back West //

I was born and raised in the ghetto
Talk with me and you'll know
I wasn't satisfied with living on the side
I started looking around for a possibility
But listen to my story, of what became of me

I met a businessman
Who said he got some friends back East
Said, "Why don't you come along?
Well we could help you atleast"
"Make you into a big star
By playing your guitar"
But the joke was on me
They left me flat to see

Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
Think I'll do alright

Struggling for recognition, identity and respect
I got a lot of promises, they told me not to fret
Said, "We will stand by you
If the going gets rough"
But when I started sinking
They didn't even bluff

Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright

'Bout a year has come and gone
And left me standing here
Thinking how it could have been
'Cause still I ain't nowhere

They surely took me for a ride
Trampled on my pride
But I'll hold my head up high
Got no more tears to cry

Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright

Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
Think, I'll do alright

Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright
