// Love Is All //

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Open up your window
Let the love come shinin'
Open up your shadow
Let the love come burnin'

Loving you is the best thing I can do
You loving me, well, you know you set me free
Set me free, yeah

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Will to fly was a thing
Money could buy
Then you know the rich would live
And the poor would die

Still I love the rich
But they're yet so lonely
And I love the poor
'Cause there stood so many
Stood so many, yeah

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take

Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes, baby

I can give you what I got [What I got, what I got]
Oh, your mind think a lot
I will take just what you got
If you say that's what you got

I know some day no matter what they say
Money will come, money will come our way
In a million billion ways
Zillion ways, no, no

Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I have to give
To give and take
Love is all I got to give
To give and take

Oh, yes, oh, yes
It's so good when you dub it up, dub it up
'Cause all I got to give and what I got to give is blood
I'll give it to you

Love is all I got to give
To give and take

// Peace Officer //

Peace officer, are you a warrior?
Peace officer, are you a warrior?
Why you carry so much ammunition
More than an aircraft carrier?
Peace officer, are you a warrior, warrior?

Peace officer, are you a warmonger, monger?
Why you carry so much ammunition for
More than an aircraft carrier?

Got your knife, got your gun
Got some blood, tear gas bomb
Got your dog, got your baton
Got your whip, got your whistle
Is it war you're defending, or it's peace?
Only tell yourself, let it be seen, who you are

Peace officer, are you a warrior?
Peace officer, are you a warmonger, monger?
Why you carry so much ammunition
More than an aircraft carrier?

What ya gonna do, when there's, no more guns?
What ya gonna do, when there's, no more babies
Peace officer, are you a warrior?
Warrior, warrior, warrior
Peace officer, police officer
Police officer, officer, officer

Peace officer, are you a warrior, warrior?
Peace officer, are you a warmonger?
Looking more like a warmonger than a peace officer
Police offer, peace officer...

// Treat The Youths Right //

Treat the youths right
Instead of putting up a fight
Treat the youths right
Or you'll been playin' with dynamite

Treat the youths right
Instead of putting us a fight

Who are the grown men and women of tomorrow
Take heed to the words that I say
Or your days will be filled with sorrow

Oooh, yeah (Oooh, yeah)
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Treat the youths right
Instead of putting up a fight
'Cause if you treat the youths right
You could be sitting on a bomb

What was hidden from the first resurrection
Now revealed in the second resurrection
What was hidden from the first generation
Now revealed to the fifth generation

Oooh, yeah (Oooh, yeah)
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Treat the youths right
Instead of giving us a fight

Or you'll been playin' with dynamite

Sucka treat the youths right, right, right, right

Now revealed to the babes and sucklings
What was hidden from the  high school students
Now, revealed to the the kids and ducklingd

Some saying things they really don't know, but

// Where There Is Love //

Where there is love, there is no war
No superstar, no police car
Where there is love, it's only right
To walk in light through the darkest night

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there's love, love, love, I'll be there

Where there is love, oh life's a gloom
But maybe it's grown, like we all know
Where there is love, there's harmony
And unity comes naturally

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there's love, love, love, I'll be there

Love suffereth long and is strong - can't go wrong
Love, envy not and is kind
What's yours is mine

Where there is love, you understand
Your brethren man, giving away
Where there is love, there's no confusion
Only solutions, illusions

Where there is love, there is no fear
Where there's love, it takes you anywhere
Where there is love

Where there is love... [repeat]
