// 21st Century Girls //

Long, blonde hair
Daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her
I mean everybody wants to
That's what I see

Europe trips
Kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything I'll never be

21st century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it sounds so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, that's what they'll believe

21st century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that 21st century love

// Apocalyptic Crush //

Yeah, you must think you're funny calling him at ten o'clock
You think he thinks you're pretty, I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me, do you think that you can win this game?

Yeah, you must think that you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over

But go ahead and shoot your shot, baby
Let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought and I think you should know

You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on earth
Babe, I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then

You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So, hey, what are the chances of World War III?
'Cause he's never gonna like you like he likes me

// baby is you //

I know you're with somebody new
But I can't write a song that's not all about you
It's not fair, baby
How come it's so easy
For you to forget everything you said?
Like how I was the best girl that you'd ever met
Guess you take it back
Should've expected that

When I say I'm fine, I'm lyin' really well
'Cause I can't love anyone else
And I'm so jealous that you can
Scared I'll never feel that again
'Cause I still can't call anyone "Baby"
'Cause "Baby" is still you to me
Don't you think I wanna move on, too?
But I can't love anyone the way, the way I loved you

// Creature Of Habit //

Planned out the conversation that we'll have when you see me
For the first time after these months of apathy
And you'll say that you want me back
And I'll say, "Babe, you don't mean that," ah-ah

'Cause I psychoanalyzed you better than your therapist
And I know that you don't love me
I know you just hate the risk of meeting someone else
Having to introduce yourself, ah-ah

You're not a hopeless romantic
You're just a creature of habit
You want me 'cause I'm easy
You want me 'cause you know me
I'm not your soulmate, babe, I swear
No, I'm just there, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, I'm just there, ooh-ooh

// Gross //

Not long ago when I saw you there
With your brown eyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown eyed boy'd be my best friend
And the one I'd give my heart to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone, you'll hate 'em too

As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

And driving in your car, I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love?
Not gonna lie, your last name sounds so ni-i-i-ce
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when you're tired, baby, I like all of it
Honestly, I can't believe you're mi-i-i-ine

I bring you up in every conversation
We're young, I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it

Ooh, and as long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

// Just Because //

I like the way you talk when you've just woken up
And I like the way we can joke about offensive stuff
I like the way you give homeless men your mittens
When you're all out of spare change
And I like the way you think, I like your reasoning
Everyone thinks you're brilliant, you think you don't know anything
I like the way you care, you're nice when no one's there
God, I hope you never change

'Cause people love to talk
And people always want something from you
'Cause that's what people do
But I don't want a thing
I think you're astounding
And I don't care what anyone says or what anyone does
'Cause, boy, I like you
And I like you just because

// L-O-V-E //

A Monday morning you meet me at the hotel, and
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much, honestly

And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back

Oh, it's L-O-V-E, or something like that
You're crazy, but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen

Yeah, this is L-O-V-E, or something really close
Hey, baby, I think you're really dope
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
'Cause this is love, right?

// Never Be Like Her //

Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could

// Pay Grade //

You call me every night and tell me that you feel like shit
I say, "I'm sorry, is there any way I can help with it?"
I listen to you scream, the world is simply your enemy
"With death and taxes, what's the point of tryna be happy?"

And I've had bad days, bad years
Bad boys and bad careers
But I'm still standin' here
I understand you, darlin', but at the end of the day
You just won't help yourself
Rather give someone else
A glimpse into your hell
Pour all your problems on 'em just so you can walk away

Boy, I'm too young to be your mother
Not smart enough to be your therapist either
And I'm always here if you need a talk
But maybe first, you should take a walk
'Cause I'm not gonna make you change
That's above my pay grade, babe

// Pretender //

What lies behind
Your pretty house with the white picket fence
And all the Barbies that you call your friends?

Is your life a lie?
Nothing's as good as it seems
And you're not the girl of their dreams

Oh, and maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
Maybe you're good at taking pictures
Maybe you're a pretender, oh

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

I'm happy with me
Think that's supposed to be enough
So why am I sulking, calling your bluff?

Maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
And maybe you're good at taking pictures
You're a pretender

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

Pretender, I guess you're really not so bad
Maybe you pretend
But you look like you got the life I wish I had
I created you
To be plastic and deadly
I created you
To hide my own envy
To hide my own envy, yeah

Pretender, I wish I knew what you knew
Pretender, if only I was like you
Maybe I'm a pretender like you

// Rebel Without A Clue //

Sitting in my room
What's it all about?
Feels like the world is gonna end
Before I figure her out

Drink up, my friend
My potion of emotion
Can you feel the love, the hate, the jealousy?
The sheer confusion?

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh

Let's sit, watch the trains all derail
They want me to learn
Well, they can sit and watch me fail
Are my friends changin'?
Or is it in my mind?
Will I ever shake hands with time?

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh, no

I don't really know who I am
And now you want me to change
I don't really know what I am
Isn't everything just so strange?

Sitting in my room
What's it all about? Oh

// Strange //

Oh no
Your voice through the phone
Tells me way more, than I ever wanted to know
You say, that you need your space
That letting me go
Was the hardest thing you could do cause
You're crazy for me, and I'm the best that you ever had

Oh no
It's kinda funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no
I saw you and her
Out on the street
You were never that public with me
I know
That you met her when you were with me
I said I had doubts and you said I was crazy
Baby, was I crazy after all?
Oh, oh, it's really funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no, I guess I was right
Wish I was wrong
Me and my heart will be fine

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

// The Ones I Love //

Sit in your car, wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're faking a smile, you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You've always been good that way

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college, couldn't wait to go back
'Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do? What did I do?
I built you up, abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

I didn't mean it, baby
I didn't think it all through
I didn't mean it, baby
Always ruin good things like you
I watched the life drain out of your eyes
And it's no surprise
It's no surprise

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
Now I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
I watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
The ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most

// Victim //

I've been bad to boys I love
Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I'm young
And my guilty Catholic heart tears my guilty self apart on the floor
But I wish that you did something bad so we could settle the score

Let me be the victim of your perfect crime
Bathe in my blood so I'm not the bad guy
I messed up so maybe mess up too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
Make the victim me

Then I'll hear the yells and see the red and blue
It'll be in the headlines, all our friends will hate you
I know I didn't deserve you, but now, it's vice versa
You'll finally see how it tastes
'Cause hurting the one that you swore you'd protect is the worst kind of heartbreak

So, let me be the victim of your perfect crime
I'll kill your conscience like you killed mine
Yeah, I messed up so maybe mess up, too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
And make the victim me
Me, oh...

// White Flowers //

White flowers and love letters
You say I'm yours forever
But it don't feel romantic, somehow

I'm pacing and I'm losing sleep
If you don't call, I start to weep
You're everything I cannot do without

I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection

Now, crazy in love don't feel sweet
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
Losing yourself in someone isn't Heaven, it's Hell

// You Never Know //

A chapter begins, the pages turn in the wind
The story's so unpredictable
But the best is yet to come, woah
I open my eyes and I can see the horizon
And the thrill's indescribable
In the California sun, it shows

You never know which way the ride could take you
Or how a breeze can make you start down a brand new road
You never know what place you're gonna end up
Even better than you dreamt of, right where you're meant to go
You never know, know
You never know, know

This summer is mine, I'm gonna give it a try
Another season, a life for me
And I don't know what happens next, no
But I'll embrace the mystery, see the forest for the trees
'Cause branchin' out, there's no tellin' how much I can grow

You never know which way the ride could take you
Or how a breeze can make you start down a brand new road
You never know what place you're gonna end up
Even better than you dreamt of, right where you're meant to go
You never know, know
You never know, know (You never know)

So, this is eighteen for me
There's somethin' waitin' for me
So, this is eighteen for me

You never know which way the ride could take you
Or how a breeze can make you start down a brand new road
You never know what place you're gonna end up
Even better than you dreamt of, right where you're meant to go
You never know, know
You never know, know
You never know, know (So, this is eighteen for me)
(There's somethin' waitin' for me) You never know, know
(So, this is eighteen for me) You never know
