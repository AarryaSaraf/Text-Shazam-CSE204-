// Alejandro //

I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro

She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Roberto

Alejandro, Alejandro

// Monster //

Don't call me Gaga
I've never seen one like that before
Don't look at me like that
You amaze me, big boy
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart (You little monster)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out (You amaze me)
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart
He ate my heart, he a-a-ate my heart out

Look at him, look at me
That boy is bad and honestly
He's a wolf in disguise
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes (Evil eyes, evil eyes)

I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby
"We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall
But something tells me that I've seen him, yeah"

That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er-er

He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He licked his lips
Said to me, "Girl, you look good enough to eat."
Put his arms around me
Said, "Boy, no, get your paws right off me."

I asked my girlfriend if she'd seen you 'round before (Oh yeah)
She mumbled something while we got down on the floor, baby
"We might've fucked, not really sure, don't quite recall (Oh yeah)
But something tells me that I've seen him, yeah"

That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er-er

He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
He ate my heart (I love that girl)
He ate my heart (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)

He ate my heart, he ate my heart
Instead, he's a monster in my bed
He ate my heart, he ate my heart
Instead, he's a monster in my bed

I wanna just dance, but he took me home instead
Uh-oh, there was a monster in my bed
We French-kissed on a subway train
He tore my clothes right off
He ate my heart and then he ate my brain
Uh-oh, uh-oh (I love that girl)
Uh oh-oh, oh (Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
(He ate my heart) Uh oh-oh, oh
(He a-a-ate my heart) Uh oh-oh, oh
(Wanna talk to her, she's hot as hell)
That boy, that boy, that boy, that boy

That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er-er
That boy is a monster (He ate my heart) (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (He ate my heart) (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster (Mo-mo-mo-monster)
(Could I love him?)
That boy is a monster-er-er-er-er-er

// Speechless //

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)

So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless?
Oh-oh-oh-oh

// Dance In The Dark //

(Make it stop!)
Silicone, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
(Saline)

Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp, but she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Tell 'em, girls)

In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde (Jon) Benet Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together, we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark

In the dark

K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kind of busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

[Beyoncé:]
Boy, the way you blowing up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster, leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home 'cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

[Lady Gaga & Beyoncé:]
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls 'cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
('Cause tonight I'm dancing) 'Cause I'll be dancing
(Tonight I'm dancing)
Tonight I'm not taking no calls, 'cause I'll be dancing

[Lady Gaga:]
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop calling, stop calling, I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sipping that bubb
