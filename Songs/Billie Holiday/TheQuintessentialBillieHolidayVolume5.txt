// My Man //

It cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got
It's my man
It's my man

Cold or wet
Tired, you bet
All of this I'll soon forget
With my man

He's not much on looks
He's no hero out of books
But I love him
Yes, I love him

Two or three girls
Has he
That he likes as well as me
But I love him

I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me, too
What can I do?

Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away
When I know I'll come back
On my knees someday

For whatever my man is
I'm his forevermore

// He's Funny That Way //

I'm not much to look at
nothing to see
just glad I'm living
and lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can't save a dollar
ain't worth a cent
he doesn't hollar
he'd live in a tent
I've got that man crazy for me
He's funny that way

Though he loves to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away
But why should I leave him
Why should I go
He'd be unhappy without me I know
I've got that man mad about me
He's funny that way

Never had nothing
No one to care
That's why I seem to have
More than my share
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

When I hurt his feelings
Once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
End it all and let him go
To some better gal
But I'm only human
A coward at best
I'm more than certain
He'd follow me West
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

// Nice Work If You Can Get It //

The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That's the best work of all if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if
Won't you tell me how?
