// Condemned To The Gallows //

[Night One]

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Goodnight...

Gripping the brightest grid
A surgical drive to increase the noise
Ice cold realization of the silent wind
Slowly drags me
Into a splintered reason
Emptiness engulf me

Align the love inside me
Let misery wake me

Search low
Search low
Abandoned

The creaking floors cry out below
A limping glimpse of next steps
The fog showers the last light of day

[Voice of trespass:]
Destroy the wooden frame
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel
To walk high above
Search low
Trust the creaking sounds
Seek the tunnel
To walk high above
Search low
Destroy the wooden frame
Confront the night

Warm blood drips on cold snow
The curtain surrounds logical thought

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned

Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows
Condemned to the gallows

Crimson moonbeam lights my journey
Crippled with time... strides into nothing
Crimson moonbeam lights... hear the waking
Crippled with time... strides into nothing

// House Organ //

[Day Two]

This frame… it does nothing to soothe
Thoughts of worst-case seep through its fiber
This frame… ignites every step
Engulf the shadows it creates

Smash, ignite
Destroy the creeping eyes
Hang the rope
Destroy this weakened frame

Two eyes lock onto my pulse
Love comes crashing on my conscience

Change my focus, lift my spirit… boy
Change my focus, you are my spirit… boy

The crimson moon shines down

Shines down
Shines down

(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem
(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem
(Shines down)
Hold your tongue, let me speak
(Shines down)
There's more to this than it may seem

// Yellow Eyes //

[Night Four]

Yellow eyes are seen circling
A whirlwind arriving for the passing storm
The hunt... the hunter inside
A whirlwind arriving

The wanderer wanders too far from the gold distance

Where they live, where the quiet lay
Their drowning heads at night
Flesh drapes on the smoking ground
And then spills (yellow eyes close in)
Onto the teeth of the once protected

Yellow, yellow, yellow

Our souls grip onto a wall
Our minds slip past this old soul

Yellow, yellow, yellow

[Morning Five]

Smoke is seen in both directions
My creation sits
My progress awaits
Smoke is seen in both directions
In rubble... their creation

Somewhere in the distance, somewhere
The softness of snow mutes my travels
Somewhere in the distance, somewhere

This landscape seems to change too often for comfort
A blinking light hides as I stumble downward
A stillness... it's too quiet
The hum of electricity
My crumbling bones seem to weld the new author
A stillness... it's too quiet
The hum of electricity... seems to buzz
The hum of electricity
The hum of electricity seems to buzz

Cut an X in my palm, leave my mark
A translation for whatever created this world for me
I sit under the crimson moon
Whatever created this world for me
Whatever created this world for me
Yours or mine? They or this?
They or this?

Yellow eyes

Tread light
Collisions open on us more
Revise
The simple task of our own

We serve our own hell
We serve our own hell
We serve our own hell

A cocoon leaking
Our own conclusions
We serve our hell well
Cope with disguise

Inner working dissect
Common phase neglect
I am tangible
Inner working dissect
Common phase neglect
With no logic

I am tangible with no logic

Change my focus, drown my spirits
There's more to this than it may seem
Change my focus, drown my spirits
There's more to this than it may seem

Blink fast into hollow ground...
Blink fast into hollow ground...

// Millions //

[Before]

Millions (millions)
Millions
Watch them fly overhead
Millions
Now please take me with you
(Take me with you)

I've lost my perspective
(Left me alone)
You left me alone

Alone and trembling
My chin (my chin) jolting back and forth
Sounds soar around
Sounds soar around
The shield you once were, you once were
My life you would defend
Sounds soar around
Sounds soar around

In my world there's only us
Bring me with you to soar
This dreadful collapsing scent...
You never strive for more

Millions fly overhead
Fog dancing slavery
Like snakes circling
Small angle jeopardy

Millions fly overhead
Fog dancing slavery
Like snakes circling
Small angle jeopardy

Millions
Millions

Millions
Millions

Millions

// Blot //

[Rehearsal]

The blot in my eyes…
The blot in my eyes…
Circular
The blot in my eyes…
Circulate
The blot in my eyes…
Circulate

All my pockets are full and
My mind is lost
Circulate
The rearview keeps shifting as
I stare at the sun

The blot in my eyes…
Circular
The blot in my eyes…
Circulate
The blot in my eyes…
Circular
The blot in my eyes…

All together… back and forth
As the wind cusps my inner mind
The sun separates me
Exposed… our greatest fear
All is here to see
Piece by piece you strip away

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by
So fast
Circulate

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by
So fast
Circulate

This is the beginning of my life

I hope you enjoy the show…
It's for you, ya know?
To watch you from across the room
To hear you through the tangled lines…
It completes me

I've been waiting

The blot in my eyes…
Circulate

[Voice of trespass:]
Computer simulation complete
Eject the suspect… mold and shape
To create memory

Bring them back I say…
Sights set on the
Uncommon agenda
Well done

Computer simulation complete
Eject the suspect… mold and shape

I won't remember me
I won't remember us
I won't remember he
I won't remember them

Eyes covered by an electrical storm
Voltage increasing, distance engaging…
A mumbling timbre
Silent to this awakening
I'm sorry… a fucking tragedy
A mumbling timbre
Smash… ignite… destroy… (destroy)
The tunnel's twisting this body
Into glass. A once hollow man…
Break through to the other side

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by
So fast
Circulate

Exploring the escape
Endless lives whispering by
So fast
Circulate

The blot in my eyes…
Circular
The blot in my eyes…
Circulate
The blot in my eyes…
Circular
The blot in my eyes…
Circulate
