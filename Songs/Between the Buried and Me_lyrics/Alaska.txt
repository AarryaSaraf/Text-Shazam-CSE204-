Album: Alaska

// All Bodies //

We all create this imagery
We all increase this lunacy
We all create this imagery
We all increase this lunacy

Floating, melting
Open sores for exploration
Floating, melting

Exploding worlds... surrounding imagination?
This will conclude our story... the first date of existence seems to be changing

We are their property, we are their slaves... we surround all bodies... focus-time stands still
We are their property, we are their slaves... we surround all bodies... focus-time stands still

Keeper of the stars, I hope to never find
We are just mortal souls left to die

We all create this imagery
We all increase this lunacy
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion

[The Discovery]

Ego controlled killing
The tables have turned
Obviously a poor creature of existence--
We die one by one

We overlooked our control... fire swarming, engulfing, transforming
Human restoration incomplete... the end

[The Landing]

This beautiful scenario can't last forever... we must go see the conclusion
This beautiful scenario can't last forever... we must go see the conclusion

Starting a new species, classify nothing... life grows with trees on high
Nature create this mechanical lust
Nature form this force fed trust
Cancellation
Motivation... creativity--
Nature create this mechanical lust
Nature form this force fed trust
We will soon live in peace
We will soon die in peace
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion
All bodies contortion

Keeper of the stars, I hope to never find
We are just mortal souls left to die

// Alaska //

The road is dry... I'm fucking delirious right now
Life goes on... glorious evening of nodding and jump starts
I need to make a personal dance party
The brain works very weird at this hour
Not the best time for lyrics I suppose

Keep writing... keep dreaming
Keep writing... keep dreaming
Keep writing... keep dreaming

Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out
Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out

Eye motions... in out... heat lightning
Scares us both... the only two people awake at this fucking hour
I won't remember this in the morning
At least I wrote this all down... please pick the right song
The one that keeps the eyes wide
Creepy... creepy... creepy
Yes, creepy
The idea of control
Controlling death with alertness
When is the fucking sun coming up
The idea of control
Yes, creepy
Controlling death with alertness
Controlling death with alertness

Then it all changes, same scenery but sun involved
Shouldn't be much different
Alaska, Alaska
Then it all changes, same scenery but sun involved
Shouldn't be much different
Alaska, Alaska

The brain works very weird at this hour
The brain works very weird at this hour
The brain works very weird at this hour

Tick tock tick tock... the rain is pouring now
Wide-awake... at least for now... nature can be the death of me
A thing we'll never overcome... in out in out

Nature can be the death of me
A thing we'll never overcome
Nature can be the death of me
A thing we'll never overcome
Nature can be the death of me
A thing we'll never overcome

// Croakies And Boat Shoes //

Croakies. Boatshoes... Collars up. Daddy's money increased my social status
"Dag, my loafer got smudged"
We are the suburban elite
"Hey where y'all wanna meet?"

I've got something to fucking prove man, I've really gotten something to prove
Dude... Brah... let's go party tonight
Maybe start another goddamn fight
But it's all right... my coach knows the sheriff

Don't stare

At my car
At my shirt
At my girl

// Selkies: The Endless Obsession //

(Slip into something more comfortable... proceed into space)

Innocent individuals... concerned about nothing but happiness
Progress becomes easy due to this social situation
Unfortunate turn of events... collapse this idea of the childish thought

No judgment
No judgment
No judgment
No judgment

No judgement towards one another
No judgment towards one another
No social status to compare
All as one
Market this change
Exploit the idea of this innocence
Exploit the idea of this innocent

Goddamn television god... corrupt me
Goddamn television god... corrupt me
Separate us... separate us... separate us... separate us
Groups of difference seem to comfort what we once didn't think of
This show was in their head for years
Enjoy this life of wonder and imagination
For it will be torn down

You will be torn down
Time to hate, kill, fuck, conquer
Time to hate, kill, fuck, conquer

This is human life at its best
We'll televise this event
You can learn how to live, breathe
Then finally die

The sweet relief is a must
The sweet relief is a must
The sweet relief is a must
The sweet relief is a must
(We can speak obsession... we can love the endless.)

// Roboturner //

Crush us
Over and over again
The years have come to this â an improper art form
Faking our own thoughts and sounds
Over and over again
The years have come to this â an improper art form
Faking our own thoughts and sounds
Faking our own thoughts and sounds
Faking our own thoughts and sounds
Robots crush
Death of human music
Robots crush
Death of human music

Bright lights fill the sky
Track us through our fields of money
The old days seem shit and primitive
Abduction... control... you write for me. Oh, master

Master of the machines
Take this shit and make it gold
Make my face sparkle with fame
Master of the machines
Master of the machines
Master of the machines
Fuck them hard, fuck them hard
Fuck them hard and neglect their thoughts
They will never see us coming
Fuck them hard, fuck them hard
Fuck them hard and neglect their thoughts

They will never see us coming
No more human voice
No more human actions
No more human voice
No more human actions
No more human voice
No more human actions

(Imperfect fucks stand in the dark.)

Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again

The years have come to this â an improper art form
Faking our own thoughts and sounds
Robots crush

Death of human-music
Counteract this idea of control
Human emotion can only produce the thoughtful
Finally discovering the idea of perfect harmony

Make this a war
Blood fills the sky
Drop the deadly dive-bomb
The end of this outside life
We will find art again
The end of this outside life
We will find art again, again, again

Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again
Crush us over and over again

// Backwards Marathon //

The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Glance towards the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
This will never change I predict
But I do get tired
But I do get tired
This will never change I predict
But I do get tired
But I do get tired
If only they knew what push we have given
For this music
For this music
For this music
For this music
For this music
This happiness that keeps us all sane

Cold nights seem to force questions, not wanting to except these thoughts
I have worked and will keep working
To keep the tradition of my one true motive in life
Music
My only love
Once building drum boxes and pretending to be the artist
I guess I'm here but it feels weird
So weird
To know how weird all this can be
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned
I guess I'm here but it feels weird
So weird
It seems, it seems to never work out like I planned
Like we planned
One day it will all come together
First place desire in the backwards marathon
One day it will all come together
That's all we can ask for
One day it will all come together
First place desire in the backwards marathon
One day it will all come together
That's all we can ask for

It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining
It's raining

When the sun comes up, it's still raining
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned
Slowly grow
Weeds turn into
Smiling trance
Never mentioned

When the sun comes up, it's raining, it's raining, it's raining
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Dance for the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
The early love seems to become jaded
I'm never expecting this
Dance for the mirror, imagination towards the stars
The endless desire for my one and only true love
Dreams won't let go
Thoughts will not change
Can't watch it fly away
Dreams won't let go
Thoughts will not change
Can't watch it fly away

// The Primer //

Prescribe me: corrupt me
Put your guns in my hands
In the hands of the young
Let's kill
Let's die
We're all equal tonight

Prescribe me: I don't want to feel what is happening
I don't want to know what I see, please don't let me cope alone, joystick revolution move me
It's all a dream
Redneck lord, you still soothe me
Behind your black tie revolution, this is just a party

Prescribe me: become the whore
Please drug the young
Follow the gods, for sex and greed bring the smiles
The rich, sexy smiles the smiles that blow the minds of every goddamn male pig out there
We all just want to fuck
What is love, the idea of love
Corpse play, tradition/marriage: we don't have to take this serious
Have you seen the cities... have you seen the images

We have to be you

2005 welcome to perfection
Prescribe me, indulge me
You have won

// Autodidact //

(Begin)
The freethinking brain can finally travel. Take in the radio waves and stew up that imagination
I worry too much
Boredom gets to me
Pussy
Yes they call me this
The masters of the ocean churn down in my mind
Calling me only what I feel at times
I just want to be loved and liked by everyone
Shining down on my every move
Impossible thoughts
Stay on this cruise
Never go back, relaxation calms these metal nerves
Need to just let go and become a giant
Forcing the improvement of our musical system
One can't do such, especially with such
Lack of confidence
Maybe they see it
Maybe they frown upon this face
Time
I keep drifting away
I look forward to these days physically, but mentally they can become very tiring
Why worry
Personal happiness should be all that matters
(I feel this most of the time) days like today Mordecai flies down on this ship
And stares me in the eyes

(Every time, can't change)
Maybe I should just be this bedroom performer I keep hearing of
No pressure, no boundaries... only
Personal pleasing... coward
Yes I call myself this
Control
Control me
Sit back now
Piss it all away
Loser losing lost (scene)
