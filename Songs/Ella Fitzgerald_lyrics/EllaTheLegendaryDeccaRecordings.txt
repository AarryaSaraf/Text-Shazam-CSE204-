// Someone To Watch Over Me //

There's a saying old, says that love is blind
Still we're often told, "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

// My One And Only //

My one and only,
What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you? 

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue? 

I tell you, I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So, my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down

When I'm so crazy over you

I tell you, I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

So, my one and only
There isn't a reason why you should turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you

Oh, I'm so crazy over you

// But Not For Me //

They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky stars above
But not for me

With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gra-ay
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee

I was a fool to fall
And get that way
Hi-Ho alas
And also lack a day

Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

// Looking For A Boy //

I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

Tell me please,
Where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of.

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe,
When he says "Hello!"

So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!

// I've Got A Crush On You //

Hmmmmm I've got a crush on someone. Guess who
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All day and night time give me sign
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I've got a crush my baby on you

How glad the million ralish from millionairs to carish
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you I shall never never know
It's not that you're attractive
But, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and night-time give me sigh
I never had the least notion that
I could fall with so much emotion

Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage
That we could share
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush, my baby, on you

// How Long Has This Been Going On? //

'Neath the stars, at bazaars
Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

[spoken]
Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four

What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

// Maybe //

Maybe you'll think of me
When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe

May be you'll think of me
When you are all alone
Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
Then what will you do
Maybe you'll sit and sigh
Wishing that I were near, then
Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
And maybe I'll say maybe

// Soon //

Soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely,
Soon, you'll find I live for you only.
When I'm with you who cares what time it is
Or what the place or what the climate is?

Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing
Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
Let's make that day come soon.

Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing home
Through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
Let's make that day come soon.

// I'm Glad There Is You //

In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you

In this world of overrated pleasures
Of underrated treasures
I'm glad there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad there is you

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad there is you

// What Is There To Say? //

What is there to say
and what  is there to do
The dream I've been seeking
has practically speaking come true

What is there to say
and how will I pull through
I knew in a moment
contentment and wholement, just you

You are so lovable
So livable
Your beauty is just unforgivable
You're made to marvel at
and words to that effect

So what is there to say
and what is there to do
My heart's in a deadlock
I'd even face wedlock with you

You are so lovable
So livable
Your beauty is just unforgivable
You're made to marvel at
and words to that effect

So what is there to say
and what is there to do
my heart's in a deadlock
I'd even face wedlock with you

// People Will Say We're In Love //

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say, people will say we're in love

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love

Don't date all night with me
Till the stars fade from above
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say, they will say
They will say, they will say
They will say we're in love

// Please Be Kind //

This is my first affair, so please be kind
Handle my heart with care, oh please be kind

This is all so grand, my dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand, they'll never, never fade

So, tell me your love's sincere, oh please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh please be kind

'Cause if you leave me dear
I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind

Tell me your love's sincere, oh please, oh please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear, oh please be kind

'Cause if you leave me dear
I know my heart will lose its mind
If you love me, please be kind

Somehow the thrill I feel is new
I never loved 'til I loved you
If you love me, please be kind
Please be kind

// Until The Real Thing Comes Along //

I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love, dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love, it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you, darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say?

I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, well if that isn't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along

// Imagination //

Imagination is funny, it makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy, your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy "What to do, what to do?"

Have you ever felt a gentle touch and then a kiss
And then and then, find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well

Imagination is silly, you go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me, too

// Stardust //

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
A lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

Sometimes I wonder why, I wonder why
I spend a lo-lo-lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago, so long ago, so long ago
My consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

// My Heart Belongs To Daddy //

In love with all
Those boys who call
On young cuties
But now I find
I'm all inclined
To keep my mind
On my duties
Since I've begun to share
In such a sweet love affair

Though I'm in love, I'm not above
A date with a duke or a caddie
It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
That my heart belongs to daddy

When some good scout, invites me out
To dine om some fine fin and haddie
My baby's sure, his love is secure
Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes I'm gonna marry daddy
Da-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ad
If you feel romantic laddy
Let me warn you right from the start
That my heart belongs to daddy
And my daddy belongs to my heart

// You Leave Me Breathless //

You leave me breathless
You heavenly thing
You look so wonderful
You're like a breath of spring

You leave me speechless
I'm just like the birds
I'm filled with melody
But at a loss for words

That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart

You leave me breathless
That's all I can say
I can't say more because
You take my breath away

That little grin of yours
That funny chin of yours
There's so much to my heart
Or give your lips to me
For darling that would be
The final touch to my heart

You leave me breathless
That's all, that's all I can say
I can't say more because

You take my breath away

// Baby, What Else Can I Do? //

Life has a crazy pattern
And fortune comes to few
I'd like to take the pattern
And fashion it for you

Though there may be lean while
Darling, in the meanwhile

I'll give you my love
I'm sure that love will see us through
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
If you want the moon
I'll bring the moon right down to you
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Someday we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen

So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams come true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

Someday we'll live in a mansion
Out where the pastures are green
But even in a small room
Just a little hall room
You'll be the king
I'll be the queen

So, please, take my heart
Just for a start till dreams comes true
Baby, baby, what else can I do?
Baby, baby, what else can I do?

// Nice Work If You Can Get It //

The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?"

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?"

// I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons) //

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart
I love you and you alone were meant for me

Please give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part
I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night

Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me

I've given you my heart
I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

// A Sunday Kind Of Love //

I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody to care
I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

My arms need someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Monday's are cold
A love for all my life to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love

I asked the Lord above
Please send me someone to love
A special Sunday kind of love

// Lullaby Of Birdland //

Oh, lullaby of birdland that's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland, whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

Lullaby, Lullaby ...

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

// Angel Eyes //

Try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight

So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laughs and the jokes on me

Pardon me but I got to run
The fact's uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Oh, where is my angel eyes

Excuse me while I disappear
Angel eyes, angel eyes

// How High The Moon //

Until I fell in love, my life was very easy
The moon just made it moonlight
The breeze just made it breezy
And then I fell in love
And think that one was clear
Now I scare to see or hear

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How high-high-high-high the moon
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How-how near-ear-ear, how far
The darkest night would shine
And if you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How-how-how-how-how-how-how high the moon

How-how high the moon
How high the moon
How high the moon

// Basin Street Blues //

Won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi?
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
Steam down the river, down to New Orleans

The band's there to meet us
Old friends, there to greet us
Where all the proud and elite folks meet
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems
Or just how much it really means

Glad to be, oh yes-siree
Where welcome's free and dear to me
Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street blues

Basin Street, oh, Basin Street
Is the street, mama
New Orleans, land of dreams

// Air Mail Special //

It's called, "Air Mail Special"
Get on, get on this special car for Air Mail

// Goody Goody //

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!

Yes you remember me, I was all for you, sittin' waitin' hoping like you told me too.
Now the action jackson's turned right around

So you met someone who set you back on your heels, goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels, hurray and halleluyah, you had it comin to ya.
Goody goody for her.
Goody goody for me.
And I hope she tans your hide you rascal, I hope your satisfied you rascal.
So goody good good for me you rascal you!

// Stairway To The Stars //

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With Love beside us
To fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us 
As we go drifting along.

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hills?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
Settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven
To climb to heaven with you

Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
Yes we're climbing
Climbing to that stairway to the stars
Stars, stars, stars
The sound of violins
Way out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us 
As we go drift drift drifting along

Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal 
Over the rim of the hills?
Can't we sail away on a little dream
Settle high on the crest of a thrill?

Keep building the stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars
It would be heaven 
Heaven to climb with you.

// Black Coffee //

I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black Coffee
Love's a hand me down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
1 o'clock to 4
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black Coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now a man is born to go a lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
To stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Black Coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

My nerves have gone to pieces
My hair is turning gray
All I do is drink black coffee
Since my man's gone away
