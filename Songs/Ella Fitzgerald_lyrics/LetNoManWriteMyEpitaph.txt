// I Cried For You //

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has it's turning
That's one thing you're learning

I cried for you, what a fool I used to be
But I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

I cried, how I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Oh, but I found two eyes
Just a little bit, little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit, little bit truer

For I cried for you
Now, it's your turn to cry over me
Over me, over me

// Then You've Never Been Blue //

If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue

I know I could go on laughing at trouble
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled

Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue

Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny

No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue

// I Hadn't Anyone Till You //

I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
A someone in this wide world, just meant for me
Now I see I had to save my love for you
I never gave my love till you

And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

And through my lonely heart demanding it
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you

// My Melancholy Baby //

Why do you grieve?
Try and believe
Life is always sunshine
When the heart beats true
Banish your fears
Smile through your tears
When you're sad
It makes me feel the same as you...
Come to me my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you;
Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through
Come on and smile, my honey dear,
While I kiss away each tear
Or else I shall be melancholy too...

// Misty //

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
Too misty
And too much
In love

// September Song //

When he was a young man courting the girls
He played a waiting game
If a maid refused him with tossing curls
He'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
For as time went along she came his way
As time went along, she came

But it's a long long while from May to December
And the days grow short when you reach September
The autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And I haven't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you
