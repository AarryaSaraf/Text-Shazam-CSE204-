// Midnight Sun //

Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height
Each star it's own aurora borealis suddenly you held me tight
I could see the midnight sun

I can't explain the silver rain that found me or was that moonlit veil
The music of the universe around me or was that a nightingale
And then your arms miraculously found me suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun

Was there such a night? It's a thrill I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone there was still some stardust on my sleeve

The pain of it may dwindle to an ember and the stars forget to shine
And we may see the meadow in December, Icy white and crystalline
But oh my darling always I'll remember when your lips were close to mine
And I saw the Midnight Sun

// As Long As I Live //

Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live.

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live.

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every day then see
the doctor anyway.

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
And that would never never do

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.

// Blues In The Night //

My mama done tol' me
When I was in pigtails
My mama done tol' me
A man's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eyes
But when the sweet-talking's done
A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing 
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Now the rain's a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin, "whoo-ee!"
My mama done tol' me
Hear that lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, "whoo-ee!"
My mama done tol' me
A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's
A-echoin' back th' blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide it's light
When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

From Natchez to mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide it's light
When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong, and he's right

From Natchez to mobile,
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
Yes the lonely, lonely blues in the night

// Somebody Loves Me //

Somebody loves me
I wonder who
I wonder who she can be;

Somebody loves me
I wish I knew,
Who can she be worries me

For ev'ry girl who passes me
I shout, Hey! maybe,
You were meant to be my loving baby;

Somebody loves me
I wonder who,
Maybe it's you.

// Cheerful Little Earful //

There's a cheerful little earfull
Gosh I miss it something fearfull
And this cheerful little earfull
Is the well known "I love you."

Stocks can go down, bus'ness slow down
But the milk and honey flow down
With a cheerful little earful
Of the well known "I love you"

In ev'ry play it's a set phrase
What the public get phrase
But as a pet phrase it'll do do do
Poo-pa-roo-it
Soft and cu-it
Make me happy, you can do it.

With a cheerful little earfull
Of the well known "I love you"

// Blue Skies //

Blue skies smilin' at me
Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

[scat]

I never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

// One For My Baby (And One More For The Road) //

It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em' up joe, I got a little story
I think you should know
We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
I know the routine, put another nickel
In the machine
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
Easy and sad
I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code
Make it one for my baby

And one more for the road
You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away
Well that's how it goes, and joe I know your gettin'
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I found, it's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
