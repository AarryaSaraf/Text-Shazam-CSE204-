Album: HelloLove

// You Go To My Head //

You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that
You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

The thrill of the thought that
You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

// I'm Thru With Love //

I have given you my true love
But you love a new love
What am I supposed to do now
With you, now you're through now
You'll be on your merry way
And there's only this to say:

I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
With icy, frigid air
And I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love

Why did you lead me
To think you could care?
You didn't need me
For you had your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
With deep emotion, devotion to you

Goodbye to spring
And all it meant to me
It can never bring
The thing that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love

Why did you lead me
To think you could care?
You didn't need me
For you had your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
With deep emotion, devotion to you

Goodbye to spring
And all it meant to me
It can never bring
The thing that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love
Through, I'm through with love

// Spring Will Be A Little Late This Year //

Spring will be a little late this year
A little late arriving in my lonely world over here
For you have left me and where is our April of old
You have left me and winter continues cold

As if to say spring will be a little slow to start
A little slow reviving that music it made in my heart
Yes time heals all things so I needn't cling to this fear
It's merely that spring will be a little late this year

Spring will be a little late this year
A little slow reviving that music it made in my heart
Yes time heals all things so I needn't cling to this fear
It's merely that spring will be a little late
A little late this year

// Everything Happens To Me //

Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have aroused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad

I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
And the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go thru life
Just catching colds and missing trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And everytime I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool
Who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
I sent an air mail special too
You answer was goodbye
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
I sent an air mail special too
You answer was goodbye
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me, poor me
Everything happens to me

// Lost In A Fog //

Like a ship at sea
I'm just lost in a fog
My mind is hazy
My thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you

Waiting night and day
Like a bump on a log
I'm going crazy
What can I do?
Help me find my way
Cause I'm lost in a fog without you

It was sunny everyday
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a fog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you

It was sunny everyday
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a fog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you
I guess I'll always be lost in a fog
Without you

// I've Grown Accustomed To His Face //

I've grown accustomed to his face
He almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune
He whistles night and noon
His smiles
His frowns
His ups
His downs
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to his looks
Accustomed to his voice
Accustomed to his face

I've grown accustomed to his face
He almost makes the day begin
I've gotta used to hear him say
Good morning every day
His joys
His woes
His highs
His lows
Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet
I've grown accustomed to a trace
Of something in the air
Accustomed
I've grown accustomed to his face

// I'll Never Be The Same //

I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once used to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again

And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring
I can't believe their song
Once love was king
But kings can be wrong

I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same
Since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same
Never be the same again again
My heart will never be the same again
Again

// So Rare //

So rare
You're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew

So rare
You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane
Couldn't compare to you

You are perfection
You're my idea
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel
I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare
This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare

Yes you're an angel
I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare
This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
So rare
Ours is a love so rare
