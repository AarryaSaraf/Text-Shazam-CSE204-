// Guilty //

Is it a sin? Is it a crime?
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do? What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say you're through, you'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime, then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

What can I do? And what can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say you're through, you'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime, then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

// It's Too Soon To Know //

Does he love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so?
Is he fooling?
Is this all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?

A one-sided love
Would break my heart
He may be just acting
And playing a part
If he don't love me
Let him tell me so
I can't hold him
If he wants to go

Though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know

Does he love me?
It's too soon to know
Can I believe him
When he tells me so?
Is he fooling?
Is this all a game?
Am I the fire
Or just another flame?

Though I'll cry
When he's gone
I won't die
I'll live on
If it's so
It's too soon
Way too soon to know

// Baby Doll //

Baby doll,
You beautiful baby doll,
Let's go home and tell my mother
That I've found a baby brother!

I'm taking you off the shelf
And showin' you off myself!
Can't you see it now you're taking me walkin',
Holding my parasol?
Aah honey, there's no use talkin',
You're a beautiful baby doll!

Oh baby baby baby doll,
You beautiful baby baby doll,
Rush home and tell your mother
You've found a baby brother!

I'm takin' you off the shelf
And showin' you off myself!
Can't you see it now you're taking me walkin',
Holding my parasol?
Aah honey, there's no use talkin',
You're a beautiful baby doll!
Baby doll,
You're a beautiful baby baby doll!

// Mixed Emotions //

I have mixed emotions
When it comes to loving you
I know I shouldn't like the things you shouldn't do
But if you were perfect
It wouldnt be the same
To a tiger a tiger's not a tiger if he's tame

But when you're near me I am happy just alone with you
But when you're far away from me I'm awfully blue
You're the bitter and the sweet combined
So what am I to do
I have mixed emotions over you

All of the time you confuse me
Oh yes I have mixed emotions
When it comes to loving you
I know I shouldn't like the things you shouldn't do
You're the bitter and the sweet combined
So what am I to do
Oh confuse
Mixed emotions
Over you
Mixed emotions
It's like you're dreaming, you're falling
And waking, a balling
I have these mixed emotions all because of you

// I'm Confessin' (That I Love You) //

I'm confession' that I love you
Tell me, do you love me too?
I'm confession' that I need you
Honest I do, need you every moment

In your eyes I read such strange things
But your lips deny they're true
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me
Saying, "Can't we still be friends?"
If you go, you know you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends

Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again

I'm afraid some day you'll leave me
Saying, "Can't we still be friends?"
If you go, you know you'll grieve me
All in life on you depends

Am I guessing that you love me
Dreaming dreams of you in vain?
I'm confessing that I love you
Over again
Over and over again

// There Never Was A Baby Like My Baby //

There never was a baby like my bady
No other baby ever had that smile
Since he's around, I just can't be a cry baby
My baby made life worthwhile

There never was another doll or guy baby
Who looked exactly like my valentine
He was specially designed for me
And if you should want his double
Brother are you in trouble
Never, no never, a baby like mine

No, there never was another doll or guy baby
Who looked exactly like my valentine
He was specially designed for me
And if you should want his double
Brother are you in trouble
Never, no never, a baby, baby like mine

// Walking By The River //

There's dew upon the ground
And not a soul in sight
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight

I hear a distant sound
I see a far-off light
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight

The murmuring waters say
There's no time to delay
So hurry on your way, my friend
If you don't get there soon
There may not be a moon
To guide you to that happy end

My heart is riding high
My blues have taken flight
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight

My heart is riding high
My blues have taken flight
I'm walkin' by the river
'Cause I'm meeting someone there tonight

// Because Of Rain //

Because of rain, I fell in love with you
The raindrops seemed to want to help me too
Because of rain, we stayed indoors and watched it pour
That's how I found the one that I adore

Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
We must thank that misty, moisty windowpane
We found our love because of rain

Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
We must thank that misty, misty moisty windowpane
We found our love because of rain

// Don't You Think I Ought To Know //

What they're saying, is it true
That your love is burning low?
If you've found somebody new
Don't you think I ought to know?

Dining at the club alone
I can feel the people stare;
Do you think I'm made of stone?
Don't you think I ought to care?

You know, darlin', I've always had
Such faith in you and the yarns you've spun
But, like a fool, I've lived and learned
That half a love is worse than none

If I can't have all of you
Though I can't believe it's so
If you really mean you're through
Don't you think I ought to know?

You know, darlin', I've always had
Such faith in you and the yarns you've spun
But, like a fool, I've lived and learned
That half a love is worse than none

If I can't have all of you
Though I can't believe it's so
If you really mean you're through
Don't you think I ought to know?
