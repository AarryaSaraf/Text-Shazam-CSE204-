// For Whom The Bell Tolls //

I see the, I see the..
I see the, I see the..
I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise
I see the, I see the rain pouring down
Before my very eyes
Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, Lord..
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord, Lord..

The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know

Bells gettin' louder, louder

I see the rain pouring down

// Immortal //

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin', dollar and a dream with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BoFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a car time vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cried?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die
Form with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Hood niggas don't lie
Form on the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the plot
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch make it quick if the Lord take me
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas sell dope, rap or go to NBA, in that order
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain
Listen...

// Deja Vu //

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

Sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it..
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a starâno, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising
I know you were made for me but
Darling don't you wait for me
'Cause I can see the promised land
But I can't do no promising

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her

Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga

// Ville Mentality //

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?

Trials and tribulations
I'm facing in this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that it faces

How long can I survive with this mentality?

My dad, he died, he got shot cause his friend set him up.
And I didn't go to his funeral..and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me.
And she..and she say, clean up..I say..

Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Dirt on my name, never
Nigga play me, never
Give up my chain, never
Give up my pride, never
Show 'em my pain, never
Dirt on my name, never

How long can I survive with this mentality?

I get mad, I slam my door and go in my room..
And then, I get mad and I say, "I wish my dad was here"

// She's Mine, Pt. 1 //

I never felt so alive, I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (I don't wanna die no more)
Cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be crying baby
I'll dry your eyes, I'll dry your eyes

Every time you go to sleep you look like you in heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me
From letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself, well how about that?

She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him, you get me
She hugs him, you kiss me
You tell me, you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you..
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

// Change //

My intuition is telling me they'll be better days
Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I like this tone..

Yeah, my intuition is telling me they'll be better days
I sit in silence and and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm in peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the father for forgiveness
God, I'm overwhelmed (Please God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if he's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, he'll never judge a man
Because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother's life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, my chosen religion: Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt hoping to God He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I tell a nigga what to do?
I just apply this economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God; I'm going hard nigga

I know you desperate for a change at the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from..

Yeah, prodigal son
Got a new gun, this one
Don't run out of ammo lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star, and remain my self
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt I evolve
I no longer bury demons
I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches disrespecting dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
Body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
'Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)

(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to Godânigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas bro...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is, this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro...
