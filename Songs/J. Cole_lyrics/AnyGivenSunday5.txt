// Heavy //

Mo' liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Get brains from a dime, How u love that?

[Verse 1]
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning
Been fucked the world but she just now cummin'
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'
I ain't never been the one for fourth down puntin'
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks
So I lock pick just to lock shit back
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year
Cause I'm repeating and I'm three-peatin'
And I'm knee deep in the game its quick sand and I keep sinkin'
The label heat seekin', nigga ain't sign me, what the fuck was he thinkin'
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season

I'm heavy
Lil nigga I'm heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Carolina I'm heavy
In New York I'm heavy
Out in LA I'm heavy
I'm so heavy

We got more liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive
Gold diggers look inside, I ain't in the back
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived
Old niggas step aside, ain't no coming back
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline
Do you love that?

[Verse 2]
No album to my name and I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it
Email the shit make sure you CC it
For these fuck niggas who don't wanna believe it
I be in the airport damn near bare foot
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it
Getting high as fuck and I don't even be weeded
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded
Real recognise real like they related
You ain't no fucking G boy, your style G-Rated
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated
fuckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated

I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy
Lil nigga in New York I'm heavy
Queens, I'm feeling heavy
Fayettenam nigga I'm so heavy
I'm feeling heavy
Lil nigga I'm heavy

// Neverland //

[Chorus]
Is the whole world gunning for me, or is it just all in my mind?
If you want it, come and see me
I ain't got nothing but time
One day youâre gonna set me free
But first you gotta let me shine
Niggas ain't high as I be
See, look momma Iâm flyinâ

To Neverland, Neverland, Neverland
Iâll probably never land
Neverland, Neverland, noo, Iâll never never land

[Verse 1]
Check my fortune cookie, its that Cole World
Could that mean itâs meant to be?
So much drive a nigga coulda been a chauffeur
This life is fucking with me mentally
Fake niggas try to act like they a friend to me
I treat you lames how I see you lames, enemies
My good girl say they wanna know the inner me
My bad girl sayinâ fuck all that, enter me
Double shots, hennessy bring out bad tendencies
Try to cut something, need a volunteer, Tennessee
Anything to take my mind off
I logged on and made them muthafuckas sign off
I got the on my dick theyâll never climb off
I switch watches yet I never took time off (time off)
I donât know whats worse, fake friends or fake fans
Both kissing ass for the chance to shake hands and damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Iâm sorting through this, organised confusion to get my thoughts together
This shit is sounding like a movie you can watch forever
I gotta make it to the top, itâs either now or never
These other niggas canât adapt because they not as clever
The shit they talk is more expensive but I doubt its better
She let that nigga make it rain but guess who got it wetter
Cold World, snow flurries in the hottest weather
And, so sick they canât fix this with medi-cine
We at yo door and she gotta let us in
Itâs what you want, I whet your appetite
Cole hit the scene now Iâm what everyone rapping like
Shame you feel you have to bite
Still ain't nobody snapping right
Pedal to the metal as Iâm speeding through the traffic lights
Bitch I gotta catch a flight, come on already
Still fight like Iâm the underdog, Iâm on already
Got a few niggas we bout to prove wrong, yaâll already already

[Chorus]
