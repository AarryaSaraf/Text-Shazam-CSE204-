Album: TheOzymandias

// Lights //

I used to want to take the Earth over
And became universe over a verse
My vision grew and my growth spurt
Now I'm sixteen and just hit six feet
Big things, dream larger, for that you got to sleep more
Desire to run rap off principles
See more blinded eyelids, open up
See more coming up, got Rakeshe on my seesaw
We are destined for greatness
Heard hard work and dedication gets places
I've been nothing but dedicated
Facing 'em, finna rise up like facelifts
Fourth grader, scared in his own basement
I'm making beats, the class talking bout spaceships
Paper airplanes, beebee guns and guess
These are my days of recording on cassette
But now fubu's gone, and I got buku pumps
All my jerseys worn, in Jersey I performed
Not bad for a little nigga like myself though
I'm like a stalker, I just follow where success go
Set goals, make it happen
Best goal, make it rappin'
Nothing in my pockets but lint, I guess I'm fastin'
But they don't chant my name and they don't call me Hov
Like what good is being the best if people don't hardly notice
More than a song, I'm surrounded by wrong, right
And sometimes I feel like they don't feel what I write
Maybe the will they next day like a long night
Call it a hangover, 'bout to take the game over
Lights

It seems to me you're kind of an icon
For someone who
I don't really give a fuck, when you get right down to it
But the prosperity led to greed and possessiveness
For someone who can see the um bad things going on but not let it sort of harden your heart
I don't care what happens to my um my species because I think this species has squandered great gifts
Namely, and especially, the gift of this mind
So I pulled away emotionally and I said you know what fuck 'em
Let 'em do what they want to do, I'm gonna enjoy this shit as a spectator
The rise
The decline
Do you have any advice for people on how you can still stay engaged in the world and not just go insane with anger and resentment

// outRUN //

[Saba and Chandlar:]
Never get caught without one
We never get caught, we outrun
Livin' dealer lives without fun
We never get caught, we outrun
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)

[Saba:]
Uh, some gold and some goals
A penny in the plan
A fortune in the future
A dream to be the man
Some silver in the scheme
Aspiring to dream
And keep it flowing y'all [?] do the same
Running competition we remain like division
On top like ceilings on top of a building
Dollar and the dream
Money and the motive
'Bout to take shots from these bars in my [?]
And you ain't in the same class I'm in
You write notes, I write hooks like Tyson
I write books, my outlook's to get the title off Microsoft
I don't spit I just cough y'all Tylenol
Tired of y'all
Don't fork I put knives in y'all
Crappy rappers I just stop
That's just something I just stop, pause
Wait, now fast forward ya
They tryna steal my writings like forgers

[Saba and Chandlar:]
Dollar and the dream
Never get caught without one
Cops come, we never get caught, we outrun
Shotgun, livin' dealer lives without fun (out fun)
We never get caught, we
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)
Outrun, outrun (outrun)

[Chandlar:]
With a dollar and a dream
Penny and a plan
Money and a motive
To be the man
With a dollar and a dream
Penny and a plan
Money and a motive
To be the man, man, man, man

[Saba:]
Look, I always sucked at math
And been decent at English
Then I picked up on rap
These are theses I'm speakin'
This is [?]
Decomposing speeches
This is needless to [?]
Close to ingenius thinkin'
Precious lyrics scripted, I'm stealin' 'em straight from scripture
This is villinous hoodlum, stealin' 'em straight from Riddler
Riddle me with your songs, my words are straight from Psalms
Papers like Vietnam
Independence begun
So in penance [?] I'm about to drop bombs
Guerilla warfare ambushin' your cars
All cars these dudes ain't support the cause
We leave these [?] bleedin', how we don't touch like gause
God leave feelin' like bruised [?] rappers
Lyrical muse and hold it down like
Moose
Or glue yo that kick flows while y'all kick boulders
You kick rocks
We finish lines

// KING //

Uh, uh
Pharaohs summon the slaves
Kings were peasants kneeling down to 'em
All on my name S - A
Everybody's on the rooftop with the same amount of seats that a coupe got
Ex-rulers turned ex-convicts
Time to count down like the bomb lit
So how we'd come to power
When the talk of selling our souls or worshipin' albums
And this is not that
It's that assassin
Like I aim at top hats and cop back
No combat to get maul like where you shop at
Nigga [?] like a comrade
While they pray, I sing
And one day I'll be king
Yeah
Uh, one day (one day)
King (king)

// The Heir //

Listening to [?]
Asking it who am I
Only time will tell like a cuckoo clock
Write letters to the mob enforcer
And I just want to be moved to God but still I
Ambitiously move like Diddy
Suburb through the city, I hustle like Nipsey
Keep it 100, I'm 100 and 50
So in every case Imma chase like Vinny
My head I'm bout to let em in
David, cosign this like letter head, paper
Vocab sharp and the pen is that razor
Still RA

And to you the main topic
Or you shine like the Arctic
I need you to be cautious
Cause they rhymes is toxic
Toxic, toxic
And when you the main attraction around the world like an atlas
Run rap till the capless
It's up to you to kill the whackness, whackness
Hey, hey

Say this is gon get em pissed, flow is epitome
Truant so fill him in, with a pen
Like outlining, y'all was in the crib I was out rhyming
I'm ahead of my time, it's
Cause I am hip hop's heir
This halo, call it whack rap slayer
Got em running away like Roy Ayers
This real time like I'm Bill Meyers

And to you the main topic
Or you shine like the Arctic
I need you to be cautious
Cause they rhymes is toxic
Toxic, toxic
And when you the main attraction around the world like an atlas
Run rap till the capless
It's up to you to kill the whackness, whackness
Hey, hey

I say I'm going on a trip with no destination
I just need something that'll get me farther than where space end
The sky is the limit, I'm a few steps past it
And impossible is nothing I believe like a catholic
Put your hands through the holes in my wrists
I want you to feel what I see
Look through my vision and you'll
And understand the tongues that I speak in

And to you the main topic
Or you shine like the Arctic
I need you to be cautious
Cause they rhymes is toxic
Toxic, toxic
And when you the main attraction around the world like an atlas
Run rap till the capless
It's up to you to kill the whackness, whackness
Hey, hey
