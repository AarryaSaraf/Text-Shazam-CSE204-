// Stoop //

'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
I'm a stoop, kid, afraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, uh

Uh, young nigga on a stoop with a shotgun
Baby I'm a slave to the profit
Lost kid and my girlfriend a boss bitch
Sling around, throw the page in the garbage
Baby said she only beg for the paper
Lick the bowl, bring the pot to the neighbour
Like, how you want, how you want, how you want it
I got that fucking flavour

(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)
Fuck the devil
Black man's choice: spit rhymes or peddle
Seen both sides on the pot and kettle
Oh my gosh, I'm a seed of the Based God
Fuck love and peace, I spit hate crimes
No deal for me, fuck a co-sign
'Cause if I want mine, nigga, I'mma take mine

(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)
Fuck that bitch
Stoop kid afraid of the change and shit
Stuck in my ways I'm a young old kid
25 in my right mind, voice of the youth it's a sign of the times
Generation Y, 1989
(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)

'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, 'fraid to leave a stoop
I'm a stoop, kid, afraid to leave a stoop
'Fraid to leave a stoop, uh

(Niggas on the roof with a shotgun)

// I Used To Be Into Dope //

Mom I'm sorry for this shit
But I can't always stay your kid
Pack my bags

// Reaper //

They told me Batman runs Gotham

For those niggas that got the last laughin'
This is what happens
When everybody directing
And ain't no fucking action
But I don't feel you
Kill have will I'm the new Ice Cube
I'm in your rear view
Sticking up crews for their fake ass jewels
I'm a fiend
I will do anything wrong for the place I rule
You cacs ain't no Jews
And your fake lawns can't replace my fuels
(Beeyatch)
Two marks your heart
Is what I can't pace
Prophecy 101 never give a date
No scripture
We are on ElimiDate
Take your time with it baby
Whipping out the minutemaid
You got a bible

Who's gonna win at the end of this title?
Please
(Get on your knees bitch)
Stress
Guns
All that shit for fun
Getting killed

// #Newblack Psa //

A message to the new black
No matter how much you wanna switch
Here's what they think about you:

Think about it Pharrell

// Pimps //

(They try to play God nigga)
Take one, take one
Take one, take one
(There seems to be a lot of [?] today)
(Cops don't go to jail for murder, we do)
Yeah...
Liberals get shot tonight
Liberals get shot tonight
Pow

(Tricks gon' die)
(Pimps gon' die)
(Tricks gon' die)
(Pimps gon' die)

If these niggas won't say nothing then I will
Fuck you Devin, I see what you're doing
I catch everything
I see potential in ya
Taking out those masons
Taking over me
I'm illuminated
I see everything
2015 and the sale's in the sewer
Rappers spitting bars for some YouTube viewers
Bitch-made insecure
Hipsters up in college
Trying to run my culture
With their fucking Google knowledge
Always see these crackers 'round when niggas get to popping
But they disappear when we are trying to stop the violence
These trust-fund kids never step foot on my island
Want credit for the game
But they never put the time in
And honestly this rap shit made a businesses from a hobby
Went from tall tees down to spinners how enticing
Fake it till you make it if the shit was getting pricey
I don't remember none of ya'll when Gucci was so icy
These sissy-ass trust-fund Kid Cudi rappers
Only want to make the game easy for those crackers
As if they haven't stolen enough genres on their own
But these coons gon' cry
And I'm gonna leave that one alive
'Cause pimps gon' die

Turn me up in the headphones
Turn me up in the headphones
Nigga turn me up
Turn me up in the headphones
Turn me up in the headphones
Nigga turn me up yeah
Turn me up in the headphones
Real shit

(Tricks gon' die)

// Once They Build A Starbucks Its Ova //

Any left-wing motherfucker
Trying to be your friend is enemy
Don't believe in his frenemy tactics
These niggas do backflips
To get a pat on the head
You step me and you're dead
Get your liberal ass kicked
Same bitch memorized every Chief Keef verse
Same one to call the cops
Think you wanna steal her purse
It hurts to say this
Niggas think they doing favors
But these hipster motherfuckers wanna steal all our creations
And claim credit for 'em
Rewrite history:
Chuck Berry to Elvis
Make our shit a mystery
Rock, blues, techno, soul, jazz, and r&b
What do they have in common?
Niggas started it
Now we barely have a part in it
(Ain't nothing out there for us)
(What chu wanna be when you grow up?)
Now some kids wanna be a fireman, a doctor, a rapper, a ballplayer
Even a fucking dogwatcher
Go to the NFL, be a teacher, or a chemist
Make an app for iPhones and get paid for your inventions
But think real hard
Think one long minute
I never heard one kid say they wanna be a critic
(You're all experts your stealing...)
See that's every single hipsters back-up plan
They fail at everything else
They need some back-up man
They spend all their parents money
All their trust-fund cash and flunk out
And these the people that ya'll let run rap
God damn
(God damn)
See these 90s babies scared to talk shit
So if I got to be that nigga, Imma be that nigga
Call you out
Grimes vinyl in a bear trap
Imma draw you out
Take you in the back of an alley somewhere
And maul you out
Then hop up in my whip until you gentrify this dick
You hipster bitch

// I'll Never Forgive Hipsters For What They Did To Brooklyn //

Escape from New York
Why I say "escape from New York?"
Cause a lot of fuck niggas about to drop man

Hipsters get the fuck out of this motherfucker man

What you know about coming out hard
Put you life in a bar turn a man into a God nigga
What you know about the infrared beam
Put a dot on your head while we plot on a scheme nigga
What you know about robbing your own folks
Taking out loans just pay for your home nigga
What you know about cussing out God
Cause you can't get a job and you need money now nigga
What you know about that?
What you know about this?
What you know about the deuce or the fist nigga
What you know about the world
What you know about caine/Kane
What you know about bigs
Top shot a nigga
What you know about a quarter-life crisis
Hands on my wallet
Give a fuck what the price is
What you know about stepping outside
Fees on the line

Nigga what you know

Won't take you home cause you look like a red guard

Tell me what you know about strangers
27 shows and they never even paid us
So you ain't know?
What you know about BK?
Fuck a hipster
Stack 'em up

What you know about keys in a bag
Fedora on the curb with my foot in your ass
D.O.A. no time for a mass
Trying to take over our culture with your PBR sipping ass

// Swirl //

Leave these little sluts man
Those sluts like that, they want Jake man
Little sluts, they want, they want niggas man
Blonde hoes, white hoes
Yeah, little white hoes
Cave bitches
Fuck white bitches, man

Affirmative action is for white women
I thought you knew this by now, but it seems you wasn't listening
A lot of feminists be acting like they down with it
But when it comes down to it, trust me they ain't down with it
Piggybacking off our struggles, who you fooling
They be talking down on black women and y'all wanna recruit em
Nah, I never had jungle fever, y'all don't please me
I just bust a nut in you ducks because you easy
I never vibe with feminists
Cause every time we move the needle
Y'all go Michelle Beadle and play that victim shit
White hoes like Mega Man, blast you til you drop
Take all of your powers and keep gunning for the top
Where were y'all feminists when Emmett Till got killed and George Stinney Jr. was murdered
Making picket signs?
I'm spitting facts, unbiased
How can you trust a group whose only goal is to be white men's sidekick
And you age like leather bags, you zombies
Binders full of women but my name ain't Romney
With those lips and those hips, you ain't down mommy
Stop fronting, acting black is your damn hobby
Don't trust em, just fuck em, don't love em
They are not your friends, they are cacs stop frontin
Fuck they race, fuck they creeds, fuck they world
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'm down with a swirl (nigga)

Passion of the Christ all around the fucking world
Basking in the lights, diamonds, rubies, fucking pearls

So do me a favor and let me be your caper

Yeah
Take my time
I'm going back to Osaka without a Father
I'm a bastard without a battery in my Acura
I'm stranded
Branded as nigga is my doom to my tome
I dad two strikes up out the womb
Too many MCs and not enough letter Gs
Bungee-cording to the rap game like it's their destiny
And I'm no Angel
Ain't got no halo around my feelers
If I could torrent cars I'd have twenty 2-seaters
I'm like War Machine's wife to your fucking wife-beater
With a bunch of rhymes in Adobe Reader bitch
I've been all around the world seen some fucked up shit
Seen a Zionist-Pious jump on Allah's dick
I hope you niggas find Allah quick
So you can tweet that black power shit
Playing with a Zionist
I'm Jay Electronica piloting this pirate ship
Jamaican Pirates of the Carribean
Man I feel like Gilligan
Switching from the light to the dark on the fly
I'm reverse Aunt Vivian
And my thoughts stronger than [?]
So if I die [?]

Finding me out in Japan [x9]

And I rather die like a man
Than be crucified to the palms of a bitch hand
These trust-fund kids would rather rap about animators
Spit some real fucking shit for their fellow man
And I lived there
So I'll be the first to tell you
The yellow man ain't fucking with your black ass
Get your mind out the gutter nigga
Take a hint
Take a charge
Fuck a beef
Man we brothers nigga
Cut from the same mother nigga
When the cops pull you over
They shoot you not them other niggas
And I'd take a hit for any of my niggas
That's more than I can say for anybody in Japan
Go figure
Man your records gonna sit on the shelf
They hate you like America and everybody else
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes niggas
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes niggas
Through all my travels
I've been with nerds
Been with killers
And the only one constant is nobody likes you nigga

With your fake rapping ass always looking for a handout
You gonna see six niggas on the bus
Three shots and one jump below, hit the canvas
I can get you anywhere fuckboy I'm random
Kill at will I am O'Shay Jackson
Young black and gifted but don't get it twisted
I take a cracker's soul out his body leave him uplifted, bitch

Pussy nigga want me in the war path
Hold up bitch, I am the star of the cast
Talk a lot of shit, never hit, do the math
I don't fuck around
You don't wanna wrestle because you green in this town
Put you on the car but you never see the map
For that fronting like you hard you gonna die in a dark match
Fuck nigga this ain't what you want
Fuck nigga this ain't what you want
You know me, no tweets, no blogs, no pics if you wanna do something nigga show me

Welcome to New York this the b-side
Leave a blank space in your fucking ride
Generation Y 1989
Everybody got a style but this one is mine (bam!)
I'm the anti-Nickelback
How I come up out the woods with the starter pack
You going out of bounds like GTA
Probably would've lived all you had to do was stay (bang!)
I shake it off cut losses
Wish a nigga would throw rocks at the prophet
03 bad blood bitch this a burial
Cannabis in your stereo breaking the walls of Jericho
Cut scenes in your wildest dreams to show you how to get the girl but I rather get the cream
Is it love that you feel when you fiend
I know places where Haitians will take you out clean off the scene

// Quarter Life Crisis //

"I didn't really start playing music, like seriously, until 25"

Too young for the old kids
Too old for the young
Too black for the white kids
Too black for my own
They say 25 is the prime of life
I feel like I'm dying from the outside
My hair thin, my wrinkled skin
Somebody help me out this quarter life crisis
I been sleeping in on Christmas every year since I became a teen
Birthday, Easter, New Year's, just another fuckin' day to me
Heard a kid on CBS say he gon' be a athlete
I wish that I had those choices made available to me
My whole life is wasted potential, I don't feel special B
Niggas nowadays be gettin' deals at fuckin' 17
When you 25 nobody cares 'bout what you feelin', yo
You shoulda made it by now nigga what the fuck you waitin' for
I been workin 12's tryna pay for fuckin' studios
Meanwhile the police is choking niggas out on video
Sometimes when I see 'em riding by I wonder who would know
If they shot me down, who would care, am I next to go
Keep my weapon tucked in my pants if they tryna get bold
All this while I'm tryna spit some rhymes I should sell my soul
Or maybe I'm just gettin' old
Kids be lookin' at the cartridge they don't even blow
They just Wiki everything they don't even know
Man fuck these kids, yo fuck these kids, I can't relate to you
Rappers talkin' bout they hate rap and they think it's cool
Lame ass niggas

"Knowing that I might supposedly be executed in the next 2 weeks, I can't plan no more future but I thinks about it. But I think about my past, the things I used to do, the people I know. You know, people who care about me, I think of them. I think of all that."

If you don't like what I do, turn the channel
Watch the fake [*beep*]

Too much, too much

Lightskin girl bitch you ain't that (dope)
All I fucking have is my bitches and my (dope)
So imma sing this song and hope my bitches think its (dope)

These pussy niggas on a warpath
Fucking around with JPEG
You'll get six shots to the head
Young nigga shared no tears for the feds
Black Oswalt bitch I came for the head
No tame thoughts I'm a maverick
All these hits I'm an addict (damn)
Communist tactics, youth
Got it backwards niggas too passive
25 years shead a tear for a savage
Loaded AR put the case to a Cactholic
Fuck the lynches
And fuck the system
Nigga white Jesus never did shit for me
Now let's put on a show for these Christians
Voice of the voiceless
Fuck Phil Brooks nigga I run shit
Bare arms on a suspect
Your limbs too short to reach for this gun bitch
Bible and convicts go
Hand to hand like crackers and conflict
Water for chocolate
Compress me a check my passion is profit nigga
Now let's put on a show
You're gonna put on a show for me

// Police & Niggaz //

1 2 1 2 3 4
Guess I needed sometime to get away
I needed some piece of mind
Some piece of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to Sixth and L.A
So I thumbed it down to nine o six ten L.A
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way

// Lee Daniels Freestyle //

Man one take this shit, man, I don't give a fuck
Uh

Turn on my TV see nothing but bullshit around me
Niggas in dresses, niggas in kitchens
Niggas acting like bitches
Fuck Lee Daniels
You could be a beacon of hope, but why bother
Tryna feminize all us niggas
Knowing most of us ain't got no father
I wish you the best, man
But you a hoe for this Empire shit
My grandfather had to die for the same rights that they just gave to you, bitch
So don't step to me with no "gay is the new black"
Acting like we some kinda brothers
Y'all done stole my past, you done stole my land
But you won't fucking take my color
Faggot

I'm a G [repeated]
Fuck you nigga

Tired of that "Yes We Can" clip
My generation's so weak, fuck all this Kumbaya shit
I go for mine, and if I gotta fight, then I gotta fight
These coon ass niggas tell me work in a system
Nigga, you just wanna be white
But I love my skin, tell me nigga, do you love yours?
'Cause the asians don't
They spend so much time kissing white peoples' ass
You would think they in love with them
That's why I don't fuck with them stupid ass niggas
Wanna follow me around your store
Giving me a hurry up and buy shtick
While crackers take all that shit, man, fuck you

I'm a G [repeated]
Fuck nigga
Put that Menace II Society sample
Hurry up and buy, hurry up and buy

Holocaust, Holocaust
Every single day in class, all I heard was Holocaust
One day I asked my teacher
"What's the difference between me and them?"
He said "All y'all niggas was slaves, and the jews got paid"
Six million of y'all, yeah
A hundred million of us, or more
So excuse, 'cause I'm all out of sympathy
2015, it's a sign of the times
My best friend is a nine
If you ain't a fag, or dressed up in drag, you better know
Being black is a crime

I'm a G [repeated]

Lil' nigga
How you expect to hold it down
When you gon' correct me
And tell me Street Fighter 1 ain't never had a bonus round
Pff, Clips killed that nigga bruh

// The Last Of Us //

Punks jump up and get they ass kicked
America done turned me to a bastard
40 acres and a mule I got a bad hand
So I keep the smoke for escape like I'm Batman
Queens [?] syndicate in the motherland
Raping her for resources niggas got me fucked up
Don't let them fool you
Over hills and valleys don't believe for a minute that these chimps won't screw you
Free [?] 2014 I learned that dark skin is [?] crackers might shoot you
Scouts wanna recruit you, spics wanna replace you
The world going to war nigga, everybody hates you
Talk about the struggle some cracker wanna debate you
Talk about the hustle, some fake jew wanna pay you
2015 I hope you niggas get away dude
Cause everyone in Israel's a motherfucking fake [?]
I speak softly on the matters of trust
Cause I don't want my kids in similar situations growing up
I treat you like my daughters and this is the last of us
I passed the knife to Ellie, tell the truth these clippers like some niggas
