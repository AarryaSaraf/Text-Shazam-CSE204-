Album: SouthOfHeaven

// South Of Heaven //

An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs
Judgment day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light you must die

Forgotten children, conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of Damnation in their own reality

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath

On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
The never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven

// Silent Scream //

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time.

Electric, circus, wild,
Deep in the infants mind.

Silent Scream
Bury the unwanted child.
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn.

Shattered, adolescent [sings: "another child"]
Bearer of no name.

Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned.

Scattered, remnants of life,
Murder a time to die.

Pain, sufferaged toyed,
Life's little fragments destroyed.

Silent Scream
Crucify the bastard son.
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn.

Life preordained
Humanity maintained.
Extraction termination
Pain's agonizing stain.

Embryonic death,
Embedded in your brain.
Suffocation, strangulation,
Death is fucking you insane.

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death.

Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest.
Innocence withdrawn in fear.
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night.

// Live Undead //

Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.

Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.

Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.

You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.

Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.

Death walks inside you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.

Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.

Live Undead.

Dead.

// Behind The Crooked Cross //

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Feeling a sickness building inside of me,
Who will I really have to answer to.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Do only what is expected of me,
With no emotions my feelings suppressed.
Blind obedience carries me through it all.
Conscience a word I learned to forget.

March on through the rivers of red.
Flesh burns, it fills the air. (Souls drift, they fill...)
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Blind obedience carries me through it all,
Do only what is expected of me.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

// Mandatory Suicide //

Murder at your every foot step.
A child's toy sudden death.
Sniper blazes you thru your knees
Falling down can you feel the heat,
Burn!

Ambushed by the spray of lead
Count the bullet holes in your head.
Offspring sent out to cry,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x4]

Holes burn deep in your chest,
Raked by machine gun fire.
Screaming soul sent out to die,
Living mandatory suicide.
Suicide. [x4]

[Spoken:]
Lying, dying, screaming in pain.
Begging, pleading, bullets drop like rain.
Mines explode, pain sheers through your brain,
Radical amputation, this is insane.

Fly swatter stakes drive through your chest.
Spikes impale you as you're forced off the crest.
Soldier of misfortune
Hunting with bated breath.

A vile smell, like tasting death.
Dead bodies, dying and wounded
Litter the city streets
Shattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit.
Dying (in) terror,
Blood's cheap, it's everywhere.
Mandatory suicide, massacre on the front line.

// Ghosts Of War //

Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise.
Once forgotten soldiers come to life.
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done,
Not content with wars we never won.

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.

Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die.
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie.

(Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn.
Rise ghosts of war.)

I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
I dominate.
I seal your fate.
I deal in pain.
All life I drain.
Memories can't ignore,
Rise ghost of war.

// Read Between The Lies //

Evangelist you claim God speaks through you,
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity.
You care not for the old that suffer,
When empty pockets cry from hunger.

Penniless from their generosity,
Sharing their money to quench your greed.
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need.
Save me.

His spirit lives and breathes in me.
The almighty transformed to your screen.
The meanings lost in its translation,
No holy words, describe his deception.

You say you'll help us find the lord,
Tell me preacher how do you know
A simple quest for a visible savior,
To lead us through our final prayer.
Save me.

Send your donations,
Contribute to the cause.
Luxuries,
Your righteous reward?

Praise the lord, praise god,
Is what you wish to sell.
There is no heaven without a hell.

In your mind's eye could you truly believe,
That by giving you can save your soul,
Could you be so naive!
You heal the sick, raise the dead,
You blind the congregation
With the things you say.

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust,
That death will come and all will be lost.

Can you hear the serpents call,
Look deep in those deceiving eyes.
Ignore the writing on the wall,
You should read between the lies.

When doubt subsides his honesty,
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer,
No sermons left to hide or cover,
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled,
To steal a dream or get it killed.
They claim your trip to heavens nearby,
You may believe it but satan wouldn't lie.

// Cleanse The Soul //

Body that rests before me,
With every dying breath,
Spellbound and gagged,
I commence your flesh to dirt.

Body that lay before me,
In everlasting death.
Entombed in abscess,
To rot and lie stinking in the earth.

Empty altar awaits its victim
Stained glass windows black.
Candles burn the midnight oil,
Incense fills the night.

Observing trance awaking state
Lying still unknowing.
Reciting the passages of time
Prepare for the impaling.

Death's an art, flesh and earth never part,
A power of the mind.
Death shines on the air of silence,
A ritual of endless time.

Purged of your dead body,
Sacrificed of your life.
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire
Enter the kingdom of desire.

// Dissident Aggressor //

Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Through cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab! Bawl! Punch! Crawl!
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath

I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
Hooks to my brain are well in
I'm stabbing and bawling, I'm punching and crawling
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

// Spill The Blood //

Come walk with me through endless time.
See what has been and what the future sees.
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed,
Step in a life that's yet to be born.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

I'll show you sights that you would not believe.
Experience pleasures thought unobtained.
At one with evil that has ruled before.
Now smell the stench of immortality.

You spill the blood,
Eternal soul.

Spill your blood, let it run on to me,
Take my hand and let go of your life.
Close your eyes and see what is me,
Raise the chalice, embrace for evermore.

You've spilt the blood.
I'll have your soul.
