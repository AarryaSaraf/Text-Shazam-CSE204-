// We Are What You Say //

We are a servant, we have a song

The side of a beehive, a tabernacle choir

We are the sound working in wars

The bishop is gone to the acolyte shores


We save our Bibles, we pull our sleeves

The word is a guard and the guard is a cleave

We are the right, we are the stay

The accolade's gone, we are what you say


We have no language, we have no chore

The side of a beehive, the bride is a whore

We are a spite, we are at bay

The spirit is life, we are what you say


We have a sermon, we have a song

The bishop is easy, the bishop is wrong

The spirit is right, the spirit will say

We are a light, we are what you say

// A Winner Needs A Wand //

Like it's killing me

It's kidding me around


This bite, You bit on me

You put on me a gown


That fits me like a quarter door

That hits me like a sound

It's like You shut on me

Or shouldn't be around


Like the fennel seed

The funny gene You found


I like the man-o-weeds

The man-o-wars abound


That fits me like a quarter door

That hits me like a sound

I might just win a war

A matador around


There's still nothing I can say to change

My news for You

There's still nothing You can do to exchange

My dues to You


Like You fit on me

To bit on me a bound


This life that's shut on me

That shouldn't be the grounds


To emulate an epicene

To elevate a sound

This life, a winner needs

A winner needs a wand


Never want to blame You

Bound You, blame me

Never want the blame You bound


Never want to blame You

Bound me, blame You

Never want the fame You found


And where's the same

And where's the strong

And where's the guard

And where's the one who tries to make You?

// Rake //

I never felt so safe

A line I once told her

Warm resting place

Her arm on my shoulder


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself


we ran into a cave

when the wars came closer

she turned into a cave

where it turned colder


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

// Siamese Twins //

My sister had two babies at one time,

they were Siamese twins, no they were actually,

they were connected at the head,

at the head, and the doctor cut them apart,

and my sister said, "I have two kids now, look at me."

// Demetrius //

Reach for the archer

He chose an offer


You are only a redeemer

You are holy, like Demetrius


Change the hoodoo caper

Strange impersonator

Make a multi-tracker

Take your book and back her


You are like that, a redeemer

You are like that, like Demetrius

// Dumb I Sound //

Something suddenly unclear

Someone suddenly my fear

My eyes demand like broken eaves

The laddle over spills on eaves


If you once knew

How I loved you


And my bruise-colored eyes peeled

Every image to your face and heel

And if you're happy I am, too

And if you're sleeping I'm with you


But you love someone else

But you want to be with someone else

And I can't believe how dumb I sound

And I put my face over the ground
[Repeat]

// Wordsworth's Ridge (For Fran Frike) //

A summer night 

I find a boat

Tied to a tree

A normal home


She lost her string 

I'm stepping in

I push the shore there

An act of stealth


A troubled glad without a voice

A mountain song, the boat moves on

The water runs on either side

The circle swell, a sudden light


Takes me


I fix my view 

Upon the ridge 

Horizon's eye

Above the gray sky


I tip my oar to raise the stroke

The wading swan, the image broke

A looming peak, a pirate size

Uprears its head, a sudden guise


Takes me

// Belly Button //

One time, this kid ate too much food,

and the food started coming out of his stomach,

out of his belly button,

there was maggots coming out of his belly button.

// Rice Pudding //

I'm taking you down

to the place in the field

and when I find you underneath the grass

I know you feel this way

You feel this way because I know you

and I feel you

and I feed you rice pudding at the benefit concert

Yeah baby, I feed you rice pudding at the concert

// A Loverless Bed (Without Remission) //

Such a shame that I can't get over this

Put the axle on and roll again


Such a Saturn eye will close again

Watching every ring turning again


And I close my eyes

To everything you've rearranged

And I close my mind

To everything you've kept the same

Put the axle on and roll again


Cannot keep you in my bed again

Wake up every time, leave your space again


When the hairline breaks and lends you in

To the woman you've turned red again

// Godzuki //

"Oh, who is that? She looks good. What's your name?"


"My name is Lauramechbaidumeinchbib Beautiful Lovely Lady. Did you hear what I said?"


"Yeah, sure I did."


"I am, uh, Chriskpalpidon."


"Ah, you wanna know what my name is?"


"What, big fella?"


"Oh, my name is, um, Godzuki."


"Ya big fella! Godzuki reminds me of a booger. Goodbye!"

// Super Sexy Woman //

She's a super human girl

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

For seein' through superhuman vision

She's got super human thighs

Sexier than television


She is super duper smart,

I like her for her mind

She'll shoot a super fart,

The deadly silent kind


She's got super human lips, for super suction

She's got super power hips, for super reproduction


She's a super human girl,

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

To see through super human vision

She's got super human thighs,

Sexier than television.


She's a lot like Catwoman

Just without the leather

She likes whips and chains

And an electronic feather.


She's got a super long tongue

And spandex underwear

She's got Superman's smile

And Wonderwoman's hair.


She's a super human girl,

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

To see through super human vision

She's got super human thighs,

Sexier than television.


She is Supergirl, Superwoman, Supersexywomannnnn...

// The Oracle Said Wander //

Cave the Cadmus country soon

Europa's sake he drew

'Till the oracle said wander


Safe libation water slew

A serpent near him knew

'Till the oracle said wander

// Happy Birthday //

Like the lantern on a tree

Your burden bright as weary be

Periwig on parakeet

You're God's great paramour and sweet


I'm happy, I'm happy

Your birthday brings a pardoning

I'm happy, I'm happy

You're like a bird that will not be


Yours will number, yours will be

A paragon, a Paraclete

Keep your bed warm, keep your humor

Keep your proverbs short and sweet


I'm sorry, I'm sorry

That life is anxious, life is mean

I'm sorry, I'm sorry

A pair of shoes is what you need


I'm happy, I'm happy

Your birthday brings a pardoning

I'm happy, I'm happy

You're like a bird that will not be

// Jason //

Jason, you're the only one

Jason, like a steady son

Like that, you're the only one

Take that, when the runner's come


When the right dragon comes around

When the knight horses burn the ground


Jason, you're the only one

Jason, like a steady son


(You're the only one)


Jason, you're the circle sun

Jason, run the rabbit run

Like that, you're the steady gun

Like that, what the Argon won


When the right dragon comes around

When the knight horses burn the ground

When the right you gave me

To make it through the night

When the right dragon comes around


(You're the only one)


We were young and noble

Riding on a plane for freedom run

A plane for freedom run

// Kill //

He took the stable

Bred me to be a mare

Made the brethren able

Gave me a room


I never asked him

I never meant meant to stay

He dressed the table

Wore a dress to be my mare


There's no pertinence

When you never leave the stall

He ran to other wars

Won't write me at all


I want to kill him

I want to cut his brain

And when it's over

I know I'll feel okay


He was a champion

We were riding side by side

Into the frontier

He left me without a ride


Where did the hour go

When the champions intercede?

He stole the cargo

Took every chance to leave


There's no pertinence

When you never leave the stall

He ran to other wars

Won't write me at all


I want to kill him

I want to cut his brain

And when it's over

I know I'll feel okay


I want to kill him

I want to cut his face

And when it's over

I know I'll feel okay


I want

I want

I want

I want

// A Sun Came //

Everything You are

Is everything we have

You're the only good thing

A sun came

Burned our faces round

Burned our faces red

You are still the rage, a rock

From the enemy

There is still a house, a cage

For the enemy

When my friends turned out, I found out

There is still a Lord

But I never felt so lonely

A sun came

// Satan's Saxophones //

I remember when my mother would get sick,

she would vomit all over the kitchen. 

She would vomit on the tables and on the countertops,

and in the refrigerator, and we called the dog, 

The dog would come in and slip on the vomit.

// Joy! Joy! Joy! //

I would like to throw a field

Yes, I would like to be a man

I would serve the Kingdom's will

Yes, I would enter to the end


Blessed is the man who waits

And blessed is the man who starts

Believe in (page)

Believe in (page)

I read every page

Read every page

Hey, (name?)

Yes, Sufjan?

So, what do you believe in?

Oh, a lot of things

Oh yeah, like what?

Well, peace and justice for all


In the middle when you came

Will the animals invite?

Every syllable the same

Every letter every line


I believe in peace

Believe in peace

Believe in peace

Believe in peace


I believe in peace

Believe in peace

Believe in peace

Believe in peace


I believe in joy

Believe in joy

Believe in joy

Believe in joy [x A Lot]

I, I, I, am, am, am, joy, joy, joy, and, and, and

I, I, I, am, am, am, joy, joy, joy


I read every page

Read every page

// You Are the Rake //

I never felt so safe

A line I once told her

Warm, resting place

Her arms on my shoulder


You are the rock

You are the rake

You are the one when I watch myself


You are the rock

You are the rake

You are the one when I watch myself


We ran into a cave

When the wars came closer

She turned into a cave

Where it turned colder


You are the rock

You are the rake

You are the one when I watch myself
