Album: Bronco

// Daytona Sand //

Buddy, we got major blues
Another suitcase in your hand
I hope you brought your walking shoes
'Cause it's quite a-ways from what I understand

So, rack 'em up, big blonde
I think I could have been your man
We watch the surfers as they whip on the strand
Ah, Daytona sand

Long hair, slow eyes, I like your style
We both ain't got a job
I haven't seen my band in a while
At least nothing seems to last that long

So hit the road, big blonde
Take me home to Mississippi
It's not that I don't care, it's just hard to make a plan
But ah, Daytona sand

I'm not mad, for what it's worth
You always take the dare, that's what I learned
I'm getting tired of this earth
But they say some stones are better left unturned

So what you say, big blonde?
Is that another whispered plan?
I've been around long enough to know you can't trust a man
But ah, Daytona sand

M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I

// The Curse Of The Blackened Eye //

I've been hiding out, running from the curse of the blackened eye
Uh-huh
Darlin' I can feel it coming every time
I sat around last year, wished so many times that I would die
Uh-huh
Left it all and now I can see the night

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow

It ain't the letting go, it's more about the things that you take with
Uh-huh
And I can feel it getting closer with every kiss
You gotta beat or join 'em, try to act surprised
Just flip a coin 'cause I'm too bored to lie

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow

Always said I should work on my escape
Have a heart too long, it's bound to break
Acting out the opus of your last eternal ache
Boy, just sing the song for heaven's sake

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow
It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, lost it all anyhow

Northeast sun
Northeast sun
Northeast sun
Yeah, northeast sun

// Outta Time //

Oh, I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Met a man in Denver, bottleneck and some old blue jeans
Tells me we got something special now
I say some things ain't what they seem
Run off with the sunrise, Reno never felt so slow
A Wednesday child with a rented ride and a head that's full of woe

And I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Drag me to the party, guess I got nowhere to go
Got a man to my left and one on my right
And they're telling me 'bout what they know
Headed for the back, I meet a girl who's tryna shoot the breeze
She tells me she don't like Elvis
I say I want a little less conversation please

And I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time

Yeah, let's go

Baby, I'm outta time

// Lafayette //

Hurry over and cry, Lafayette
I knew that I'd lose you the moment we met
But the bayou still sings every night in my head
Though I can't understand what it wants
I love when it rains but I hate getting wet
Never thought it'd be me that you'd haunt

Can't remember your words, Lafayette
You said, "Words didn't matter, it's what's in your head"
But if you don't ask then you're bound not to get
Still know what you said wasn't wrong
I can't turn a corner or walk down the street
Without seeing your face come along

Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, "There ain't no cowboys left"
But they ain't met me and they ain't met you, Lafayette
They ain't met me, Lafayette
Ooh
They ain't met you, Lafayette

The months march away, Lafayette
I hear it takes years for the heart to reset
Yeah, but one of these days, I'll be done with regret
Didn't think it would take me this long
Still sing Delta Dawn when I catch a sunset
I remember how you loved that song

Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, "There ain't no cowboys left"
But they ain't met me and they ain't met you, Lafayette

// C'mon Baby, Cry //

I can see the sadness in your eyes
You've been tryna hide what you left behind
They say it's darkest before the dawn
But you've been smiling for so long
A thousand teardrops can't be wrong, no

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry

I can tell you're sad, boy, just like me
Baby, don't deny what your poor heart needs
Been so long since he called your name
On the run from a losing game
Just bat your eyes, baby, let me feel the pain

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry

Three words everybody knows
Must be nice where lovers go
Take my hand, don't let it go, just cry

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand, darlin' let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
You can call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry
C'mon baby, cry
C'mon baby

// Iris Rose //

Bez Valley never saw the day
I would've wanted you to watch me play
But I hear the songs there are better
Thinking back to those Southern nights
Give it all to hear you call me, "Guy"
But I know that's why we don't say never
And I wish you'd stayed
Maybe I'd be the same
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose
Let's go

Get along darlin', sweet goodbye
Sit alone, together, watch the sky
You tell me not to cry so I just sigh
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose

Think about you nearly every day
Dream a lot and it starts to sting
But I hear the wild winds are clever
Red sand keeps you waiting now
Sing it loud so you don't have to shout

And I'll say, "I wish you'd stayed"
That's how she goes, yeah, Iris Rose
Iris Rose, Iris Rose
Iris Rose, Iris Rose

// Kalahari Down //

I was born in the Badlands, honey
Strange place for a boy to drown
Spent my days on a mountain, baby
12 miles north of Sofiatown

You've been gone away, I've been riding around
Running out the days, writing out a song
On my daddy's guitar, did you find your way? Skip another town?
Said I couldn't stay but it's different now
Yippee-ki-yi-yay, I'm always down
For hanging around

Left to borrow, gone tomorrow
Maybe there ain't a trail to follow
Better off alone if you ask me
Travel lucky, Kawasaki
Maybe next time I'll take you with me
And I still hear the sound
The wind come up, Kalahari down
Kalahari down

Polishing your whip, never drove it far
Circling the veld, spitting in the jar
On your daddy's farm, you'd say you're afraid, tell me not to frown
Play a song, you'd dance around
Yippee-yo-ki-yay, we'd hit the ground
Still tumbling down

What do I know? A buncha sorrow
Promises of a desperado
Through the rusty sky I feel the breeze
Where do we go? Mendocino?
Maybe someday you'll get to see all
The places that Torino's never been
And I still hear the sound
Wind come up, Kalahari down
Kalahari down

Left to roam on a reckless wander
Raising sand on the setting sun
Keep an eye on that dusty highway
Tell my mother I'm nearly done
And I still hear the sound
Wind come up, Kalahari down
Kalahari down

// Bronco //

Pack your bags, baby
Polish up, ride out
You gotta bolt when you see the gates are down

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child running something on the wire

Flash of fire, feel the afterglow
Hit the ground and who's laughing now?
Forget about the score, yeah, who cares anymore?

Bad news buddy, every dog does get its day
Yeah, I know
Catch the sun, boy, let 'em say your name

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child running something down the wire

Sick of waiting for the hole to mend
Play it out like it's all pretend
Passing up a fight, you're gonna lose in the end

And ooh see the cowboy sing, yeah
And ooh it's just another scene
And ooh you've gotta live with what you said
Circling the drain
Wondering if the pain is the same

Bronco running wild, yeah baby, I'm on fire
I'm just my daddy's child, running something down the wire

Come on in hot, babe
Hurry up, babe
Can't you see the gate from here?
And nothing holds me back at all
Nothing left to fear
Best of luck, my dear
Bucking side to side
Bronco running wild

// Trample Out The Days //

Mulholland's gold and you're awake, babe
The season's grey
You drive real fast and I can tell that it's just not your lucky day
Or so they say
Boulevard boy, give me nothing, you're the one I chose
And so it goes

Baby
The light stays longer when it rains, babe
Ain't that a shame?
Take me out to the race, toast our mistakes

And I hate to say
I spent it all on masquerades
Oh and I, I'd forgotten how it goes
Flash a smile while the traffic's slow
Take a seat while I trample out the days

Baby
Your eyes grow cold into the night, babe
You start to fade
You had your reasons, but I'm telling you that seasons always change
Hold it up to the day, wish it all away

And I hate to say
I spent it all on masquerades
Oh and I
Watch me waving as I go
Bury my heart at the rodeo
Take a seat while I trample out the days

// Blush //

Red sky at morning, I still think of calling
You met me alone in the city
A fisherman's son, my dad liked to run
Can't picture your face, but I know it was pretty
Yeah, you drew me that night
I saw love in your eyes but I didn't know how to begin
When I walked you to mine, promised we'd take our time
Baby, some of us we ain't meant to win

Saddle up and ride on down
Maybe when the tide comes out
Come and find me
Waiting on the street where we met
Haven't found the time to forget
Funny what we lose, yeah when we bet
Hey!

Red sky at night, I was holding too tight
You left me alone by the Thames
Under waterloo's shine, had a dream we were fine
Maybe somehow we were, in between
Still there's something 'bout men that I don't understand
They're always leaving wherever they've been
Brush it off with a shrug, I don't know much about love
Still I give it a try now and then

Saddle up and ride on down
Maybe when the tide comes out
Come and find me
Waiting on the street where we met
Haven't found the time to forget
Funny what we lose, yeah when we bet

Red skies all gone, I guess it's been long
I haven't gone back that much to your city
Still nothing compares to the night we were there
It's okay, I don't want any pity
Yeah, but spare me a thought if you got any heart
I know you had one deep inside
I don't miss you that much but, baby, watching you blush
Some of us, we just gotta ride
Some of us, we gotta saddle up and ride, saddle up and ride
Yeah, saddle up and ride
Saddle up and, and ride
Ooh
Saddle up and ride

// Hexie Mountains //

Blue child, repeat it in your head
Young man, fill yourself with dread
"Come home", the Hexie Mountains said
To begin another end
It don't feel right to see you, friend
And wouldn't it be nice if I could sleep in my own bed?
The Hexie Mountains said

What happens when the well has dried?
Take me down the dusty side
I can't find the words, so I guess it's time
To move on once again
Down the path less tread
And wouldn't it be nice if I could let the dead stay dead?
The Hexie Mountains said

Take me far enough to say we're gone
I haven't been out in so long
Noah called to write a song
I'm not saying I'm not scared
That the wind'll blow and stick my stare
But wouldn't it be nice if I could hold it off again?
Wouldn't it be swell if I could get things off my chest?
"Maybe you'd learn to live with what's inside your head"
Hexie Mountains said

// Let Me Drown //

Been finding it hard to be kind
Since I've been lost out there, losing my mind
And I still keep on searching for what I can't find
Let me drown

Don't wanna wash you away
I swear there's good things that are coming your way
And I can't be the one left here dragging you down
Let me drown

Only one knew my name
Nothing left but the summer rain
Drag me 'round 'til I never complain
Let me drown

And then suddenly we're writing out the same old lie
When water is all around
Baby, I can be the one you drown tonight
Well, I had sun in my eyes and I'd confide
We're no worse off than the worst of 'em, it's fine

Never knew where was home
I slept a lifetime alone
Yeah, we had it one time but it's gone now, it's gone
Let me drown

I know with pleasure comes pain
I figured we were the same
But as I get older I get more afraid
Let me drown

So, no I can't be kind since I lost my mind
And this town just ain't big enough for the both of us now
Let me drown
No, I can't be kind since I lost my mind
And this town just ain't big enough for the both of us now
Let me drown

// Any Turn //

Pack it in, pick it up, dropping off, dropping out
Night trails, old tales, next day, underpaid
No flight, can't write, same songs, new night
Duncan's in the can again, I'm crying all night
'Bout a guy with another guy waiting for me 'round the back
Heavy time, no go, next show

Bad cough, big mouth, next stop, down South
Bet's in, write 'em out, sounds bad, time's up
Sleep now, upright, late start, feel fine
Dreaming 'bout the time but you can't now, never mind
Pointing out the sun

Heads on line, left behind
I'm gonna find any turn, woo-hoo

Neck cracks, take-backs, no pen, sad sacks
Swinging at the Troubadour, Dee's, skate Fairfax
Midtown, big town, roof's gone, wrong town
In the van again, big head, goin' down
Something 'bout a horse and a man and a Cadillac
Quick bump, short stack, no brains, head back

Set 'em up in the motel room
Baby, it's all come and go, I feel down tonight
Yeah, where's home tonight?
Sit alone and be so ill
Set it all on someone else's bill, woo-hoo

No smokes, bad jokes, ten bucks, good jokes
George, Gram, Paris, Buddy, Bobby, Bobbie, Beau
Boredom's gonna getcha, thinking's never better
State line, red wine, saying what you know
Bedtime, old time, anytime, midnight
Let's fight, baby, fall down, good night

No time, heads on line
I'm gonna find any turn, any turn

// City Of Gold //

Yeah, I used to find hope in the wreckage
Dark news in from the past
And all I can feel is the feeling that we'll never say hi if ever we pass
So, send word to my last known existence
Lost at last in the wind
It's all come-ups and clover until it's all over
You know all good things come to an end

And if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine

I'm too easy on giving out chances
Too long alone on the range
You might think that I'm strange but I come with a pain
Of a man scorned again and again
Some folks think about their lovers
Some folks think about their goals
I've been thinking lately about the way you'd speak to me
I think it's time I disappear, I'm feeling old

So if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine

So, just sit with me morning and nighttime
Have me on your front porch
I'll be still, I'll be quiet
I never knew why it was so hard for me to be who you want
Yeah, I've thought about finding new lovers
Thought about burning the past
All that I want is a kind heart to haunt
My shrink says it ain't too much to ask

So if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
Back to the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're mine

// All I Can Say //

Sun comes up over the plains
Lay in bed, sleep the day away
Think of all the things we used to see
All those pictures of you and me
And I, I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

Warm nights wane, we hear the trees a-hummin'
Softly you whisper, you hope it ain't gone
Sit in bars, sit on sidewalks, sit down and just cry where you're standing
I sit alone anyway, every night in your arms
And now I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore

For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye

Count the lights, think of what we had
Baby, I'm headed back west
Go ahead, be beside yourself
Drive 'til we got nothing left
Hold my breath 'cause I'm scared to death
We didn't know it 'til now
I hate springtime anyhow

For now, yeah, for now
All I can say, all I can say
All I can say, all I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
All I can say, all I can say
All I can say, all I can say is goodbye
