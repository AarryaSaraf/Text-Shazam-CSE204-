Album: RosesInTheSnow

// Roses In The Snow //

I met my darlin' in the springtime
When all the flowers were in bloom
And like the flowers our love blossomed
We married in the month of June

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

Now God has taken my darlin'
And left me with a memory
A memory I will always cherish
Are these last words he said to me

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as a golden glow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

My darlin's buried on the hillside
Where all the wild spring flowers grow
And when winter snows start fallin'
On his grave I'll place a rose

Our love was like a burning ember
It warmed us as cold winds blow
We had sunshine in December
And threw our roses in the snow

// Wayfaring Stranger //

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
While traveling thru this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger
In that bright world to which I go

I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home

I know dark clouds will gather around me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me
Where God's redeemed their vigils keep

I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home

// The Boxer //

I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my existence
On a pocket full of mumbles such are promises
All lies in jest, till a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

Well I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station runnin' scared
Layin' low seeking out the poor quarters
Where the ragged people go, looking for the places
Only they would know

Li Li Li [etc.]

Only seeking workman's wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

In a-laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was home
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't a-bleding me
Bleeding me
Going home

Da Da Da [etc.]

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every bloke that laid him down or cleft him
Till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

Li Li Li [etc.]

// Darkest Hour Is Just Before Down //

The sun is slowly sinkin'
The day's almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on

The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
The darkest hour is just before dawn

Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A-watchin' the sheep down below
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go

The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul
Let Jesus in
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The darkest hour is just before dawn

// I'll Go Stepping Too //

Don't think that I'll be hangin' 'round
While you're havin' fun
I won't sit there cryin' over you
Well from now on when you step out
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

Now everytime you come in late and we begin to fight
You tell me there are more fish in the sea
But the bait ain't what it used to be
And I got news for you
Now after this when you go out
Well I'll go steppin' too

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

>From now on when you come in
And won't tell where you been
With your hair messed up
And your clothes don't fit you right
Well I don't care if I find perfume on you too
Well you will know that I have been
Steppin' just like you

Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey
I'll go steppin' too
I'll lock the door, put out the cat
And I'll go steppin' too

// You're Learning //

You are learning what it's like to sit and cry
And wonder why your plans went wrong
You are learning how it feels when pain is real
To realize you're all alone
Yes you're learning

We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only you'd meant what you promised
We wouldn't crying today

You are learning that a lie can make you cry
For the truth your heart reveals
You are learning that a flirt can cause a hurt
Even though your love is real
Yes you're learning

We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only you'd meant what you promised
We wouldn't crying today

You are learning that a lie can make you cry
For the truth your heart reveals
You are learning that a flirt can cause a hurt
Even though your love is real
Yes you're learning
Yes you're learning

// Jordan //

Come in as you tread life's journey
Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and safely
Without Him walking by your side
But when you come to make the crossing
At the ending of your pilgrim's way
If you ever will meet our Savior
You'll surely meet Him on that day

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er

That awful Day of Judgment
Is coming in the by and by
We'll se our Lord descending
In Glory from on high
So let us keep in touch with Jesus
And in his grace the Love of God
That we may be ever called ready
When He calls us over Jordan's Tide

Now look at that cold Jordan
Look at these deep waters
Look at that wide river
Oh hear the mighty billows roar
You'd better take Jesus with you
He's a true companion
For I'm sure without Him
That you never will make it o'er

Oh what, what you gonna do
Oh what, what you gonna do
Oh how, how you gonna feel
When you come to the end of the Way

// Miss The Mississippi And You //

I'm growing tired on the big city lights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary, far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you

Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you

Roaming the wide world over
Always along and blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's door
Miss the Mississippi and you

I'm growing tired on the big city lights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore
I am sad and weary, far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you

Days are dark and dreary
Everywhere I go
Miss the Mississippi and you

// Gold Watch And Chain //

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Darling, how could I stay here without you
I have nothing to ease my poor heart
This old world would seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we never will part

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Take back all the gifts you have given
A diamond ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false but is fair

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again

Oh, the white rose that blooms in the garden
It grows with the love of my heart
It broke through on the day that I met you
It will die on the day that we part

Oh I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you'll love me again
