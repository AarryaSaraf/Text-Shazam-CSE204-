// Amarillo //

My baby never was the cheatin' kind
But it wasn't 'cause the ladies didn't try
Now everywhere we go
They're walkin' 'round him slow
Givin' him a flutter and a sigh
Now I got him past that redhead in Atlanta
Lord I walked all over that black-eyed cajun queen
But outside of Amarillo, he found his thrill, I'll tell you
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

Oh Amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

If we only hadn't stopped in there for coffee
If someone hadn't played The Window Up Above
He'd still be mine today
But he heard those fiddles play
One look and then I knew this must be love
Oh that pinball machine was in the corner
Well he saw the lights and he had to hear 'em ring
And he never was the same after he won his first free game
Oh I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

Oh Amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

Oh Amarillo what'd you want my baby for
Oh Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me
Hooked him in the first degree
While he put another quarter
Push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

// Together Again //

Together again  my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
But nothing else matters cause we're together again

Together again the grey skies are gone
You're back in  my arms right where you belong
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters cause we're together again

Together again  my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters now we're together again
No  nothing else matters now we're together again

// Feelin' Single - Seein' Double //

Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight
I was feelin' single, seein' double
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble
But today I'll face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night
When I came home from work this morning
My baby was feelin' low
And he told me what was on his mind
Then he told me where I could go
Well I didn't go where he told me to
Cause the water was cold in the lake
Now there's something fishy 'bout this whole deal
I don't see where I made my mistake
Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight

I was feelin' single, seein' double
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble
But today I'll face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night

When I woke up this morning
Like me, the sun was high
Well I started walking the long way home
Just to think of an alibi
Well I couldn't think of a darn gawn  thing
That hadn't already been said
So I guess I better just play it by ear
Cause I'm already dead
Well I really had a ball last night
I held all the pretty boys tight

I was feelin' single, seein' double
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble
But today I'll face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night
Yes today I'll face the big fight
But I really had a ball last night

// Sin City //

This old town is filled with sin
It will swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away
You've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn
The scientists say
It will all wash away
But we don't believe any more
Cause we've got our recruits
And our green mohair suits
So please show your I.D. At the door
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

A friend came around
Tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd
So he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
On the thirty-first floor a gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

// One Of These Days //

I won't have to chop no wood
I can be bad or I can be good
I can be any way that I feel
One of these days

Might be a woman that's dressed in black
Be a hobo by the railroad track
I'll be gone like the wayward wind one of these days
One of these days it will soon be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back and I'll say I left in time
Cause somewhere for me I know there's peace of mind

I might someday walk across this land
Carrying the Lord's book in my hand
Goin' cross the country singin' loud as I can
One of these days

But I won't have trouble on my back
cuttin' like the devil with a choppin' axe,
Got to shake it off my back, one of these days
One of these days it will soon be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge to go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back and I'll say I left in time
Cause somewhere for me I know there's peace of mind
There's gonna be peace of mind for me, one of these days

// Till I Gain Control Again //

Just like the sun over the mountain top
You know i'll always come again
You know i love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin
I've never gone so wrong as to telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where  I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till i can gain control again

Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what sea I've have been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where  I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till i can gain control again

// Here, There And Everywhere //

Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There  running my hands thru  his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be  someone is speaking
But he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there
To be here and everywhere  here there and everywhere
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him
Everywhere knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there
To be there and everywhere  here there and everywhere

// Ooh Las Vegas //

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city you know
You're gonna make a wreck outta me

Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'cause I think I'm gonna win

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city you know
You're gonna make a wreck outta me

Well, the Queen of Spades is a friend of mine
The Queen of Hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is a which

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city you know
You're gonna make a wreck outta me

Well, I spend all night with the dealer
Tryin' to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Tryin' to get out of bed

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city you know
You're gonna make a wreck outta me

// Sweet Dreams //

Sweet  dreams of you
Every night  I go  through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me, it's plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true
Why can't I forget the past, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

// Jambalaya //

Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have good fun on the bayou

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and a fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Thibideaux, Fountaineaux, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

Jambalaya, a-crawfish pie and a fillet gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

// Satan's Jewel Crown //

Now if I were a queen and a ruler of nations
With diamonds and jewels profound
Well, I'd rather know that I had salvation
Than to know my reward
Would be Satan's jewel crown

Satan's jewel crown
I've worn it so long but God for my
Soul has reached down
His love set me free
He made me His own, and helped me cast off
Satan's jewel crown

Oh, the life that I live so sinful and needless
Drinking and running around
All the things that I do for the love of the devil
I know my reward
Will be Satan's jewel crown

Satan's jewel crown
I've worn it so long
But God for my soul has reached down
His love set me free
He made me His own, and helped me cast off
Satan's jewel crown

// Wheels //

We've all got wheels to take ourselves away
We've got telephones to say what we can't say
We all got higher and higher every day

Come on wheels take this  boy away
We're not afraid to ride
We're not afraid to die come on wheels take me home today
So come on wheels take this boy away

Now when I feel my time is almost up
And destiny is in my right hand
I'll turn to him  who made my faith so strong
Come on wheels make this boy a man
