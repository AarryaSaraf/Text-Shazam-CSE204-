// Still Feels Good //

Hey, hey, hey, yeah
I wanna tell ya
Hey, yeah, ah ha
I'm here to tell ya

You try to be so cold
Right down to your very soul
Your curiosity elapse late
But now I'm leaving that all in the past

I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
And when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is

Hey
Still feels good to me
Hey
Yeah, hey, hey

[?]
Just like curiosity killed the cat
Satisfaction brought him back
We both know it's the only reason
I got that [?]
Ha

Hey
Yeah, hey
Hey

I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
No, cause I intend to call it like it is

I wanna see, I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
No, cause I intend to call it like it is
I wanna see

I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
[x4]

I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is
I wanna see, I wanna see
If it's still, if it's still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is

I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me

// Post Mortem //

Hey you, on the corner
Hey you, on the street
The whole wild world gonna get some
Just shake it, take it, fake it to the beat

Post mortem
Post mortem
Post mortem
Post mortem

(Is it for your money, huh)
It's the joint
(Is it for the money)
(He says), it's the joint
Gonna move with the move
Gonna get down with the guitar
(So good), ya'll
(Are you being serious)

Ha, ha
Whoa, yeah
Ah, ha

Say you're tired of all the dancing
And when you can move your beat
That's when you know for sure my friend
Post mortem can't be beat
Say you're tracked up
And you find it hard to move
It's okay hear what I say
You'll fall back in the groove

Ha
Ha, ha
Ha, ha
Get me out

Is it for the money
See it's the joint, joint ask him
Is it for the money
I told ya, it's a joint
Gonna move with the move
Gonna get down with the guitar
Get ya groove on
(Serious)

// Smile //

Your smile is like a shining sun
It follows me
And the movements of your body
Always makes me lose myself

But oh, just how lucky can one be
Chills run over me
And I dig myself
We've danced awhile
Disco hustling's our style
And you, you and me

When those glittered lights hit ya
It really shows what your body can do girl
With that dazzle in your eye
The places you took me left me high
Oh yeah

But oh, just how lucky can one be
Chills run over me
And I dig myself, ha
We've dance awhile
Disco style, hustling
And you, you and me

When those glittered lights hit ya
It really shows what your body can do girl
And with that dazzle in your eye
The places you took me left me high
Oh yeah

You took awhile
Just to smile girl

Come on dance with me
Don't leave me girl
Good, you look so good

// Funk, Funk //

Get up, we are eternal funk
Alias the phemaldehyde funkmen
You can't see us but you can feel us

Get up on the funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Feel it begin to rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
If you're tired of the same ol' sound
Get up on the Cameo sound

'Cause we are living funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Come on, dig the funky horns

It is our will to let you know that we exist
So don't resist
Let it all hang out
Huh, don't be a dead boogie, baby

Yeah, dig my heavy drift, yeah, dig my heavy drift
My drift's too hip to resist, my drift's too hip to resist
To get off on is a trip, to get off on is a trip, funk, funk

If you can do with me I can do with you
Just like 2 supposed to do
Hey, hey

This sure ain't none of the P funk
It's gettin' down on the C funk
'Cause we are living funk, funk
Funk, funk, funk, funky

We can be funky as we want to be
And can be funkier than that
We were here before you felt the funk
And we will be hear after the funky feelin's gone

I'm stretchin' out on the floor, I'm stretchin' out on the floor
It feels too good to ignore, it feels too good to ignore
Sweats all over my face, baby, sweats all over my face
It's a crazy place

I'm breakin' out on the floor again, baby
It feels too good to ignore
Sweats all over my face
Funk, funk, it's a crazy place

// Rigor Mortis //

I don't see why you won't groove, won't have this dance with me.
Rigor Mortis won't sit, just sit there and you'll see,
The music sounds to good for you to look and act this way.
Just free your mind of all your thoughts and you will surely saaayyy yeah!

Are you ready? For the party maker!
Are you ready? For the jazz taker.
Say uh, uh, uh - get on down.
Say it feels good then sure man get on down.
Say you-can't do it like you should.
Then move aside, cuzÂ [?] ain't how to do.
Now get on down! [conversation]

If you hustle - that's cool.
If you bustop, you know thats cool too.
Say you can't do what you wanna do.
The musics good, I wanna get down wichu.
Say I've got to shake it out the scene.
What's good for you, might not be good for me.
Now get on down!

You shake your hips, you got on down, there's not much more to say.
And now this thing is over, I'd like to go your way.
You say that's not too slick, cuz ya man couldn't dig it quite that way.
Well, Hey! That's cool, go on home, we'll party anyway.
Now get on down!

Are you feeling good
Feel good together

Gonna feel good

(Makes me feel so good)
Gonna feel good

When I get up in the morning
I face the world with my smiley face
And people around don't get me down, no
Cause I don't like walking 'round and 'round
Good times I feel there's so much to do
But I just get down for the best

Just good times, yeah
Good times
Having a real good time

When I get the notion to party, yeah
You best believe I don't waste no time
I know the world will change
Most people stay the same
They always talking about what's right and what's wrong

If the principles conflict with your morality
Just hang it up if that's what happens to be
(Jumping)

Shim, bah, dah, bah
Do, do, do, do, do

Do, do, do, do, do

// Stay By My Side //

Somethings people just cant see
And of all the things that are real
They pretend they don't exist

(I had to forget my pride)

And let my destination ride
And I founded something there

(and please don't let people fool you
Your women love got to be the closet
The closet thing to your)

I met many of women in my days
And theres one thing they all had to say 
Since you came into my life 
Everything has been so nice
Yea hey yea um um um

(stay here with me by my side)

Cause if I lose your love I'm sure to have lost
Umm everything

(you have always been my guide)

And with no further do... I'm thinking you
For being here

How can you say that you been her man

(when you really don't understand)

Just what - shes all about

(stand strong and amitted when your wrong)

You have nothing to lose and all to gain
You know you needed her

(and please don't let people mislead you
If they understood the situation
Their life would be much sweeter)

Though all my friends look at me and said
They say how could you let a women make you feel this way
But if they only knew the joy it is
Their life will be alot sweeter too.
Baby baby baby yea

(stay here with me by my side)

If I lose your love I'm sure to have lost em everything

(you have always been my guide)

You always been my guide baby
And with no further do 
I'm gonna thank you
I wanna thank you
Baby - I'm thanking you
Yea o yea...

(stay here with me by my side)

Yea if I lose your love I'm sure to have lost em everything
