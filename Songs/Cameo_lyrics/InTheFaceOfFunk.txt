// The Man //

I gotta be in monaco
Somebody tell me what to do
Cause I'm in love in monaco
Come on and tell me what to do monaco
I gotta be where I saw you
I gotta be in monaco
Cause I'm in love in monaco
Somebody tell me what to do
Cause I'm in love in monaco
Yes I'm in love in monaco
I'm on a train to monaco
Take a bite of the night honey for me
And do it again
I'm on the run to attract you
So watch me watch me now
I'll do what I please
I walk on a ledge
You're calling me down
And you can't stop me
So watch me watch me drown
La la la la la la

I gotta be in monaco
I gotta see you I gotta go
Cause I got my mind on monaco
And you will see that I'm on to you monaco
I gotta be where I saw you
I gotta be in monaco
Cause I'm in love in monaco
Somebody tell me what to do
Cause I'm in love in monaco
Yes I'm in love in monaco
I'm on a train to monaco
Take a bite of the night honey for me
And do it again
I'm on the run to attract you
So watch me watch me now
I'll do what I please
I walk on a ledge
You're calling me down
And you can't stop me
So watch me watch me drown
La la la la la la
