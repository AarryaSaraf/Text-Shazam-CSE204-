// She's Strange //

Straaaannnnggeee....

Ow, fine lady
Ow

I like the way she walks
I like the way she talks
she turns me on with a special concern
now I'm a different guy
and I don't compare to many
but next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
that surrounds the girl wherever in the world
she's a 9, a 10 a 25th
she's bittersweet and...

She's strange
and I like it
She's strange
Just the way she is
Strange
Walking down the avenue
She's strange
Always doing something new

She's the kind of person everybody knows
She reeks distinction from head to toe
She's my twilight zone, my Al Capone
She's my rolling stones and my Ava Perone

And I like it
Yes I like it
I like it
The way she wears her hair
And I like it
Oh oh
I like it

In room 123, she elusive you see, like the invisible man in drag,
and when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her, she'll be waving her skirt as a flag,
Like the cold in October she'll take you right over,
It's not mean to be facetious
and that look in her eye says your the guy she plans to spend this evening with

She's strange
and I like it
She's strange
Just the way she is
Strange
Walking down the avenue
She's strange
Always doing something new

No, No, No, No, No
Knock me off my feet,
Strange

// Love You Anyway //

Whisper softly in my ear
Make my dreams come true
Dancing lightly meet the mood inside my mind
Above my pillow smiling brightly down at you

Your name always on my mind
And in my heart it's true
Come delight me in the dark, inside my love
Beside my pillow now
I'll give it all to you

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

Take my heart down off the shelf
Use your love as the key
Please unlock me from the pain to which I'm bound
You won't regret the time you shared your love with me, oh yeah

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

If you don't go, I'll try to show you
All the love you need
You never know, all the love you need
Girl you should know all the love you need

// Talkin' Out The Side Of Your Neck //

So you can see we're back into this same old mess?
Seems like every time we get out of one situation
We're back into it all over again

All you people that watch you talk
You better get it together or we won't get it done
We sit down while you cuss and fuss
But guess who's suffering, nobody but us

Now we're a dedicated people and we do our job
But the harder we work the game gets hard to beat
One for all and all for one but it's harder to play
When you can't have fun

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

You carry the weight but we carry the force
And that's ain't fair so stop rockin' the boat
You think you get away with political crimes
But don't take this for granted

Just get out of my house, now some of the people
Some of the times but not all of your people all of the time
Trick you get, bored too, General Matt Conrad
Ronnie Reagen too

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Cligdi, cling die? Clindi? Hosh posh?
Clinge ding? Cling me die? Clinge ding?
Horns? Hoshpsh?

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

// Hangin' Downtown //

You're wishing on a star
It's the only one that sits there
Next to the silvery moon
I don't feel too optimistic
But I know I'd trade the world
For what I am wishing would come true

I know you told me more than twice
Of the fate that I'd been dreading
But if you walk right up to me tonite
Would you doubt that I'd be ready
So I walk the city streets
Wishing you were here with me
Falling in love again
(baby until then)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Been tied to lonesome roads
Making residence in two bit 4 wall domeciles
Never time for what is needed
So I grab a bite to eat
Then maybe grab a smile

So hard to give it up

You know I tried so many times before
Any price of sacrifice 
To see you walkin thru the door
Girl I'm tryin to make you see
I'd rather have you here with me
Fallin in love again
(baby until them)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Though I walk the city streets
I'd rather have you here with me
Falling in love again
(baby until then)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
