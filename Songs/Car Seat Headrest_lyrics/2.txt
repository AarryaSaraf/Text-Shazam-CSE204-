Album: 2

// Smokezone //

I should've slept six hours ago
But I was watching this HBO show

Now I've gotta open boxes
Tape the lid of boxes
How much more boxes?

I've been working all night
Anybody have
Anybody have a light?

Don't puke on the silverware
I should maybe cut my hair

How many times have I checked my watch?
Hope no one saw me stretch a lot

And now I've gotta open boxes
Tape the little boxes
How much more boxes?

I've been working all night
Anybody have
Anybody have a light?

[Rest of the lyrics are played backwards:]
Don't puke on the silverware
I should maybe cut my hair

How many times have I checked my watch?
Hope no one saw me stretch a lot

And now I've gotta open boxes
Tape the lid of boxes
How much more boxes?

I've been working all night
Anybody have
Anybody have a light?

// This One Time I Went To A Coffee House... //

Everyday I love you
But you just want to ignore me
That is not such a healthy relationship
Today I went to a show
And no, I didn't talk to anyone at all
Today I went to a show
And no, I should really learn how to speak
Baby

Ooh
Yeah

I thought I saw a star
But it was just a plane
I thought I saw the moon
But it was just you

Baby, I wanna hang with you but I
Should really learn how to talk

// We Are In Space //

Nothing is fragile, everything is unbreakable
Nothing is fragile, everything is unbreakable

We are in space (Ooh)
We are in space (Ooh)
We-we-we-we-we
We-we-we-we-we
We are in space (Ooh)
We are in space (Ooh)

Space

There are problems in our minds
We can solve them we've got time
There are problems in our minds
We can solve them we've got time

We are in space

// It's You, You're The Asshole That Made This //

I just wanna stop and stop to see you

Oh it's all wrong, you always sing that song

// Shoelaces //

With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long
With our hair untied, and our shoelaces long

Let the love pour in, let the love
Let the love pour in, let the love

Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green
Seeing was the sun, and the grass it was green

Let the light pour in, let the light
Let the light pour in, let the light

In the sun
It was love
In the sun

Let the love pour in, let the love
Let the light pour in, let the light

Act suspicious for me half time
Act suspicious for me man
Act suspicious for me mad time
Act suspicious for me man

Act suspicious for me baby

I speak in monotone, leave my fucking microphone

Act suspicious

Act suspicious

Whoa!

I made my head explode, end up on the glorious road

// The Majestic Hotel //

Beach home on a sunny day
Washing all my trouble away
Sun will never rain on me
And I got sand all over my sandal

Boardwalk by the Lebanon [?]
[?] that it will not sail
Got it over like it never even fares
And I got sand all over my sandal
I got sand all over my sandal
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal (I got sand over my)
I got sand all over my sandal

Woah, a week at the hotel
Woah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)
I got sand all over my sandal (Woah-oh-ah, a week at the hotel)

// 90 //

I didn't hear I think so
I'm giving him my things though
I didn't hear I think so
I'm giving him my things though

91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98

// Fiction I //

It's like
Some thoughts and dreams

[?]
I'm lost inside this world

You're driving the car
I'll fall asleep

I love your neck
I want to live inside your neck

Besides
Wish I had [?]
Well now it's bigger
[?] fuck

In your suit and tie
You look so goddamn indestructible

I miss your womb
I would live
Inside your womb
If you had one

Every note I leave
Will come out
Wearing its feathered clothes

I regret not being able to stroke you off satisfactorarily

I was just a kid
I'm still just a kid
Run my fingers
Through your neck
I misheard
How am I going to kill myself?

// Hanging Out With My Mom In Women's Apparel //

Are you now or have you ever
Are you now or have you ever
I did not wash my hand after
Pissing on an essay which was supposed to be graded [?]
(I did not wash my hands after)

Nine point rubric (I feel like if I'm not saying something humorous, then I'm just wasting everybody's time when I talk)

We said something creepy
You said something creepy
And I said something crabby
We said something creepy (We saw someone I don't know)
We said no one knows
You said something creepy (We saw someone I don't know)
We said no more
I said something creepy (We saw no one knows)
We said no one no
