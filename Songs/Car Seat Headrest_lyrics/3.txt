Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

// Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Fag //

My fingerprints are getting burned off
From using the too hot touchpad
Of my MacBook Pro
As I casually scroll through
The fetish-based forum
Of which I am an active member
I promise I will never use the term anthro-fiction
When describing your body of work
I promise I will never stop overusing superlative words
Like rad or awesome or neato

Because you always work on Thursday night
And I need something else to analyze
I'm making a fortune, painting you a portrait of the artist

While we're waiting for these updates to upload
Let me talk for just a minute about your youth
Of the symbolic father figure
I haven't been outside since last week
When I went to the beach
Where I spent the whole time
Looking at the ocean wishing it was warmer
Where I spent the whole time
Looking for a stronger wireless signal
Because cellular net only had two bars
And was very unreliable

Because you always work on Thursday night
And I need something else to analyze
I'm making a fortune, painting you a portrait of the artist

When I was a kid going into elementary school
Right before I went into elementary school
I was afraid of everything
Like, I couldn't listen to the radio; I was afraid of the radio
And now that I'm going into college it's like the exact same thing:
I am literally becoming afraid of everything, and it's-

Because you always work on Thursday night
And I need something else to analyze
I'm making a fortune, painting you a portrait of the artist

Did you want to see me?
You didn't want to see me
Did you, old friend, I can you hear you stealing
Loving in the locker room
It's a careless mistake

How many people can fit into a robe?
When you stop drinking everything
Just starts to not invite me to your party
Lock the door on me

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

Did you ask me anything?
I didn't ask you anything
Think I understand just what's pretending to
Not ignore me
Sitting at your amber dress

Letter with an extra letter in my name
And we've known each other for far too long
To be losing punctuation on this alcohol

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
(See you there, see you there, see you there, Will)
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
(See you there, see you there, Will)
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

Did you want to see me?
You didn't want to see me
Did you, old friend, old friend, I can
Hardly remember all the times we slaved
Over our friendship

We had a share of hard times
Sign my yearbook, I don't wanna be in anymore
Debt to Mister Ray-Bans you didn't even like when you were in them

See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will
See you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I'll see you there, yes I will

And I hope you have a good time, hope you have a good time when you're there

Did you ask me anything?
I didn't ask you anything
Think I understand just what's pretending to-

[A conversation between Will and his mother:]
Yes?
Um, I need to go out for a while and get the van
Okay
[?] and then I'm gonna go grocery shopping, so I should be back by 1:40. Have you eaten anything today?
No
No?
Just waking up

// Foreign Song //

Hit my hand on a windowsill
Hit my head on a windowsill
Hope this doesn't mean
No one will come home with me

Put my hand on a windowsill
Hit my head on a windowsill
Hope this doesn't mean
No one will come home with me

I see you next to me
I see you next to me
I see you next to me
Oh, yes I do

Hit my hand on a windowsill
(I see you next to me)
Hit my head on a windowsill
(I see you next to me)
Hope this doesn't mean
(I see you next to me)
No one will come home with me
(Oh, yes I do)

(Oh, yes I do)
(Oh, yes I do)

(I see you next to me)
(I see you next to me)
(I see you next to me)
(Oh, yes I do)

// Sun Hot //

Sun get me hot
Sun going down

// Beach Fagz //

Woke up, had a boner
Dragged a comb across my boner
I said it's high time for us to experience high tide
No thanks I don't drink and oh god are you drunk
What you've done this vibrato isn't helping things much
No one should trust my statement of faith
Cause I didn't make eye contact and I kept touching my face

Be honest
But not that honest
Be honest
But not that honest

I think I know where the bathrooms are here
I've been going to this restaurant for 17 years
For a minute there
I thought you were twice as tall as me
You're no Spencer and I'm no Dan
But we'll sound like Wolf Parade much as we can
For a minute there
I thought you were twice as tall as me

Not that honest
We'll be honest
Not that honest
Be honest
Not that honest
We'll be honest
Not that honest

You said, "why don't you just grab the brush from da Vinci
And tell him how he could be doing it better"
I said
"You're supposed to call him Leonardo"

I wish I was a kid with an adult boyfriend
I wish I was dead

// Summer Bummer //

I can see you in the light
It's a gentle light
Can see you in the light
It's a gentle light
I can see you in the light
It's a gentle light
Oh

(Two, three, four)

I can see you in the light
It's a gentle light
Can see you in the light
It's a gentle light
I can see you in the light
It's a gentle light

Ooh

I can see you in the light
(Bom bom diddy dee, bom bom diddy dee)
It's a gentle light
(Bom bom diddy dee, bom bom diddy dum)
Can see you in the light
(Bom bom diddy dee, bom bom diddy dee)
It's a gentle light
(Bom bom diddy dee, doo diddy dum)
I can see you in the light
(Bom bom diddy dum, bom bom diddy dee)
It's a gentle light
(Bom bom diddy dum, bom bom diddy dum)
(Bom bom diddy wah, bom bom diddy wah, bom)

// Ryan North By Northwest //

He knew what everyone was looking for
He found a market and capitalized upon it
He'd always look me straight in the eyes when he was talking
He'd give the world a more presentable version of himself

He spoke in terms of what we wanted rather than what he wanted
(He presented his argument in a convincing manner)
He presented his arguments in a convincing way
(And he always had a smile on his face that was ever)
Whenever he spoke the room fell silent, not as if they were scared of him
(Condescending, but always cheerful, as if he was just so happy to see you)
But as if they were really scared

I want to
I want to

Dare I say, an honest man (I want to)
Dare I say, an honest man (I want to)

// Beach Drugs //

Taking a ride
Think I got so high on my aeroplane
We hit the sky
It was red and white like a candy cane

I get around
I get lost and found in my aeroplane
Would you go and say girl you don't [?]

You can fly
And I say goodbye to my aeroplane
[?]

Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
Wings so wide I don't care where we go
At all
No, no

Taking a ride
Think I got so high on my aeroplane
We hit the sky
It was red and white like a candy cane

I get around
I get lost and found in my aeroplane
Would you go and say girl you don't [?]

// Beach Death //

Woke up at dawn, there was ice on the lawn
And I was threatening to shoot the birds
The sun didn't come so you started to hum
A song that you never heard
I was alone so I called your phone
But you were just having too much fun
I thought it was raining so I looked at the painting
Of you sucking someone else's thumb

Someone's been messing with all of the questions
I've been asking my Ouija board
It spelt out 'goodbye' and it started to cry
And I watched it 'til I got bored
Took a break, I was starting to shake
And my amp was turned around
I started to play and I liked it that way
But my mom told me to turn it down

Don't wanna see, don't wanna watch
Don't want a season to go by
Someone took it from his bag
Someone explain

I went together, it was only the weather
That was getting my body down
So I took a vacation to another station
And I took pictures of the ground
I was getting stiff, so I jumped off a cliff
And landed at your feet
Told you something and you started to sing
A song that had no beat

Don't wanna see, don't wanna watch
Don't want a season to go by
Someone took it from his bag
Someone explain

I can't
Even finish
I don't
Want to
I can't
Even finish
I don't
Love you

// Beach Funeral //

Beach fag is dead, died in the night
As we slept, alone in the night
I had a dream we were here
It came true but things got fucked up
Send my body into the ocean
Cut it up: a good meal for the fishes
I can swim, I'll be alright for awhile
My Xiu Xiu is broken, I can't even listen
