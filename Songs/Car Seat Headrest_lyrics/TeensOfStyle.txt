// Psst, Teenagers, Take Off Your Clo //

Send me a letter, send me your glow
I got it bad now, I want your clothes
Send me a picture, send me your glow
I got your soul now, I got your clothes

Send me a letter, send me your glow
I got it back now, I got your clothes
Send me a picture, send me your glow
I got your soul now, I got your clothes

Hey teenagers, take off your clothes

// Oh! Starving //

Goodbye secret files
When I'm gone all this information will die
Goodbye stupid smiles
When you're gone all anyone will do is cry

I used to enjoy losing money
But now all I do is win
And now it's far too easy to be satisfied with things
I used to enjoy being worried
But now everything is fine
I wish I could go back to that unhappier time...

Cats crawl into gutters
Just at the sight of me
(I'm not happy unless I'm unhappy)
You guys got mad skills
I just got mad
(I'm not happy unless I'm unhappy)

I used to enjoy losing money
But now all I do is win
And now it's far too easy to be satisfied with things
I used to enjoy being worried
But now everything is fine
I wish I could go back to that unhappier time...

Goodbye all you secret files
When I'm gone all this information will die
Goodbye all you human styles
When I'm gone I won't have it in me to tryâ¦

// The Drum //

The drum wakes up. Heâll have a real black eye this time
Hungover dream. He hung around too long last night
The drum gets up. How will he feel about this one?
The dream throws up (he didnât feel too good this time)

Heâs got it all. Heâs got it figured out
Dream in the hall back in the hospital
Iâm not concerned. Heâll get it straight this time 
And if he doesnât, fuck it 

The gun goes off. Heâs always off about something
The drum just nods: the drum ainât listening at all
The drum gets drunk, the drum reads James Joyce in the drunk
The dream falls down. The drumâs face breaks the dreams fall.

He donât have shit. Heâs learned to live whit it
The drumâs in debt â you owe me donât forget 
That $20, interest and moral support â and if you donât I swear 

(this is our lifetime + I am his creator)
(a snowman slowly pulled apart by separate poles of gravity)

The drum goes forth. Heâs got his flag unfurled or something
The drum wonât stop the drumâs a menace to the public

Hold your drum high (the drum is stoned again)
Donât wake him up heâll just start talking.
The drum is dead {the dream is dead)
Long live the drum (long live the drum)
And I am his creator

// Sunburned Shirts //

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

I haven't picked up the phone for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't picked up the phone for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

(I haven't been outside
...I haven't been outside)
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

People here bang on the walls late at night
People here, their smiles are all growing teeth
People here, they're here to die
Can you help me get out of the city?

People here, they lock their doors nice and tight
People here, their smiles are all growing teeth
People here, they're here to die
Can you help me get out of the city?

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

// Something Soon //

Biting my clothes to keep from screaming
Taking pills to keep from dreaming
I want to break something important
I want to kick my dad in the shins

I was referring to the present in past tense
It was the only way that I could survive it
I want to close my head in the car door
I want to sing this song like I'm dying

Heavy boots on my throat I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
I can't talk to my folks I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
All of my fingers are froze I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
Only one change of clothes I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
My head is my head is my head is

Stay inside all this winter
Filling out forms from a busted printer
I want to talk like Raymond Carver
(an advertisement cries out)
I want to turn down the goddamn TV
("He should have gone to Jared's")

Binging on the latest sitcom
Feeling guilty every second it's on
I want put my foot through a window
(I document my mind loss)
I want to romanticize my headfuck
(through instruments of wordplay)

Heavy boots on my throat I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
I can't talk to my folks I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
All of my fingers are froze I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
Only one change of clothes I need
I need something soon
I need something soon
My head is my head is my head is

Let's burn this house down...

// No Passion //

I never feel
I can never feel
Oh I
Was cut open
And now I
Can never feel

I don't want to do this, I am thinking
Like a child, I am speaking
To no one, spitting words out like dirt
In the morning I'm a corpse
Draft my emails to the corporation
"you're saving my life every day, god bless you"
There's no way out for cowards
Suicide is embarrassing
The whole town at your door
"Come back David we need you"
I just needed more money
More time, more love
All my desires are so poorly drawn now

I never feel
I can never feel
Oh I
Was cut open
And now I
Can never feel

I know who stole my face
But I don't know who will replace it
Now I'm still alive, but I got no perspective
When the album is over
I will go to bed sober
I've got plenty of love, but nothing to show for it
In my wildest sexual dreams I dream
That I'm watching porn, but there's too much sunlight
Shining on my laptop monitor
So I can't see anything with any amount of clarity

I never feel
I can never feel
Oh I
Was cut open
And now I
Can never feel

// Strangers //

If I can fit my dreams
We say the same things over and over
Into an ABAB rhyme scheme
You say the same things over and over

Love makes it easier to be human
Love is the payoff for the life that we're losing
God is a scientist he's just found out about us
He's published a study but he don't know much about us

When I die I won't become a ghost
Because I'll have nowhere to haunt
Fuck this town and fuck my dirty hands
When you're strange, if they like you then they gotta be stranger
But they're just strangers

Society wants me to fuck, well fuck them
Car seat is a genetic stop sign
I sleep lying next to a mirror
Car seat is a menace to the public

Love makes it easier to be around humans
Love on the TV, who'd they think they were fooling?
God is a director, he's just found out about us
He's talked to our agent, but he don't know much about us

When I die I won't become a ghost
Because I'll have nowhere to haunt
Fuck this town and fuck my dirty hands
When you're strange, then the critics gotta be stranger
But they're just strangers

Car seat's nervous and the lights are bright
When I was a kid I fell in love with Michael Stipe
I took lyrics out of context and thought
"he must be speaking to me"

I won't last too much longer
I'm already starting to run out of places
For faces in my head
They're all starting to look the same

// Times To Die //

All of my friends are getting married
All of my friends are right with God
All of my friends are making money
But art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

I think Iâm gonna build a giant hotel
Lest we be scattered, Iâll stack it sky-high
Itâs not symbolic, itâs just human nature
Under the foundations, there is a graveyard

Weâve all had better times to die
Weâve all seen better times to die
Weâve all had better times to die
We all had better times to die

âGet a job!â
Job lying in bed while all his friends chant âyou mustâve done something wrongâ
But he just keeps singing this song

Got to have faith in the one above me
Got to believe that Lombardi loves me
Itâs a deal
I want a deal
Letâs cut a covenant

And when they took him to the temple
Oh, then they fed him to the devil
And when they took him to their temple
Oh then they fed him to their devils
And when they took him to the table
(HEY MAN WE LISTENED TO YOUR DEMOS)
Before they fed him to their devils
Oh when they took him to the temple
Oh then they listened to his demos

Most of the time Iâm just getting older
But Iâll get to heaven standing on your shoulders
So many people you know that could make you
They say kid youâre good, but do you have what it takes to be
Invited into the divine council?

Weâve all had better times to die
Weâve all seen better times to die
Weâve all had better times to die
We all had better times to die

Invited into the divine council
Invited into the divineâ¦

Would you give it all up if there was another scene?
Would you kill it to see and to be seen?
Would you give it all up if you had another scene?
Would you kill it to see or to be seen?

Is it harder to speak when you're holding the machine?
Is it harder to sleep when you can hear him breathe?
Is it harder to speak when you're holding the machine?
Is it harder to sleep when you can feel him breathe?

// Los Borrachos (I Don't Have Any Hope Left, But The Weather Is Nice) //

Being sad's so boring
I'm taking a vacation
I'm driving down to see my old friends tonight

Let's spend the week with rosy cheeks
And crush the grapes beneath our feet
And stop burrowing through old chocolate boxes
Like a heartbroken Bacchus

(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I miss those good old boys
They could still find joy in life to talk about

So leave that girl behind you
Or whatever it is that's got you
We've still got time for one more drink tonight

Think what the others would say
If they saw you in the bathroom
Kicking the stall door
They'd say get out of your head for a while
Jump into mine
Leave it on repeat and it says

And if I'd been a parrot I'd have been a very good parrot
And if I'd been a parent I'd have been my own parents
And if that's not apparent then it will be soon

I miss those good old boys
They could still find joy in life to talk about

I miss you
(I don't have any hope left, but the weather is nice)

If you're trying to live, you have to own what you do
If you're trying to live, you have to own what you do
Oh Jesus Christ I, I wish I could talk like that
But such is my place in life

I, I don't have
I don't have any hope
I don't have any hope left, but the weather is nice

I miss you

// Maud Gone //

When did our heart
Stop beating?
Used up all the heat
When did it start
Our meeting?
It's been on repeat
I know there's a full moon every night
It's just not always bright
But it's been so long since I saw the light
Maybe I haven't been looking at the sky

Maud, now you're gone, now you're gone
(Sweetheart, please love me too long
My heart's too strong
Love me too long
Sweetheart, please let me hold on
To these old songs
I've loved too long)

And when I'm in bed
I'm dead
No one to check my pulse
And so instead
My head
Begs not to be so full
And when I fall
Asleep
Which part of me writes the dream
And which part falls
Asleep
Who's running the machine?

I know there's a full moon every night
When I dress black, it snows white

Maud, now you're gone
