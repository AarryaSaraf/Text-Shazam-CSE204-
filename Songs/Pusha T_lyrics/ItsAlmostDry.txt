// Brambleton //

They're gonna die
Why would I wanna

We was out in Brambleton after Pooh got hit
Club entourage in that new drop six
Ice that'll snag any new hot bitch
Champagne super soaker screamin' who got this
Beach niggas wanted work that they could move out quick
But my Norfolk niggas, they was on some shoot out shit
You and I, we were different like the two got mixed
Buyin' biggies but was ridin on some 2Pac shit
We was both hurt when we see how Q drop bitch
Said we knew the ledge better, we the new plot twist
Who knew your face bein' all across the news outlets
Would mean forever I would never talk to you 'bout shit

Huh

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

You would pay sixteen, I would pay eighteen
When I paid twenty-two, still was a great thing
Laid up countin' a million, we daydream
Till the plug took back his half, that's they change
Who was with you roaming the halls at night pacing
'Cause the feds watching them things that we chasing
Sliding doors just like the van on eighteen
Revolvin' doors on them whores, they playthings
It was much more than foreigns that we were racing
If the past catch your dash, no erasing
Black Rarri, white hood, make it a race thing
Who knew our dynasty would end up a Xinjiang thing

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

It was sad watching dude in Vlad interviews
Really it's 'bout me, he channeled it through you
Had a million answers, didn't have a clue
Why Michael kissed Fredo in Godfather II
Names they concealed, I don't make up shit
This that no witnesses wrapped in duct tape shit
Needed all my niggas just to move your brick
That had me on Brambleton back when Pooh got hit

Why would I wanna hold you down
When I know you now, the past is your go to now
Shit, we really used to roll around
Coppin' quarter pounds, from the border towns
And shit, Ferraris gettin' ordered now
Can't water down, got fathers to you daughters now
Shit, but let me bring it all around
Roles are different now, niggas need to tone it down

Why would I wanna hold you down

// Let The Smokers Shine The Coupes //

If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em baby I'm Jim Perdue
Cocaine's Dr. Seuss

We sip ace out the flutes
Chanel scarves out the roofs
If I never sold dope for you
Then you're ninety-five percent of who?
How forsaken are the rules
I done paid for all of yous
If first fourty-eights the clue
Your jail cell was made for two
AMGs on auto cruise
The wrist's singin', auto tune
The dope game destroyed my youth
Now Kim Jones Dior my suits

If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em baby I'm Jim Perdue
Cocaine's Dr. Seuss

Coca leaf and potpourris
Chains over Le Coq Sportif
Don't brag bricks to me
If they ain't tell ya to bring your skis
My Patek, hers petite
The triple play we eat Phillipe's
Bird feather's dun made me chief
Whatever happened to black Marquise
Might buy your bitch a Jeep
I can make you lose your sleep
You millionaires on just tv
Now make it make sense to me

If money is the evil root
Let the smokers shine the coupes
Rich bitches that love the boost
I'm just here to find the truth
If kilograms is the proof
I done sold the golden goose
I got 'em baby I'm Jim Perdue
Cocaine's Dr. Seuss

// Dreamin Of The Past //

(I was dreamin' of the past)
It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players, uh
We hollowed the walls in back of bodegas, uh
(And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, "Gimme, he got plenty, yeah"

Bruh, you niggas ain't flexin', you crampin'
My weight keepin' niggas on the bikes like Amblin
Weight loss, rent loss, scramblin' (I began to lose control)
Now pass the champagne to the champion
My niggas get money, get money, get money like Ye samplin' (I began to lose control)
Gun stutter, make the drum line like Grambling
MGM gamblin', blew a small mansion (I was dreamin' of the past)
Annoyed 'cause this bitch callin' Lanvin "Laen-ven"
Fuck who you stampin', them niggas just stand-ins (And my heart was beatin' fast)
Not me, they censor and block me
You hollerin', "Top five," I only see top me
Award shows the only way you bitches could rob me (I was dreamin' of the past)

It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players, uh
Clip 'em, baby, if he flinch at the price of Bottega, uh (And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, "Gimme," he got plenty, yeah

Bruh, you niggas ain't drip, you dryin'
Kevlar in his Balenciaga jacket linin'
You and your bitch income combinin' (I began to lose control)
I'm sending' Lorraine Schwartz diamond minin'
Find 'em, I came up with Enzo drifters (I began to lose control)
So you gotta understand there's a difference
There's window stickers and window lickers (I was dreamin' of the past)
You know the type, always tryna get in your picture
I was tryna get the dope through, in your sister (And my heart was beatin' fast)
We won baggin' up the work, wouldn't be no dishes
Be no Christmas, mistletoe, be no kisses
Made a way for ourselves, we ain't need no wishes, hah (I was dreamin' of the past)

It's levels, it's layers, so pray for the players, uh
We hollowed the walls in back of bodegas (And my heart was beatin' fast)
I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, "Gimme," he got plenty, yeah

Walk it down like Brady, gets better with time
Didn't have to reinvent the wheel, just a better design
Critics, he's out of his mind, haters, he's outta his prime (I began to lose control)
Yet, always where the money's at like lottery signs
Still I climb, rockstar, Third Eye Blind (I began to lose control)
I was bored by these albums so it gotta be time
No reward for the latter, so it gotta be mine (I was dreamin' of the past)
Huff and Puff in the club, then I gotta be Shyne

Properties all across the board, this monopoly's mine (And my heart was beatin' fast)
'Came a minister in my prime so I gotta be Shyne
I used to watch The Fresh Prince and pray the house would be mine
Coulda bought it but I ain't like the way the kitchen design (I was dreamin' of the past)
Born in the manger, the son of a stranger
When daddy's not home, the family's in danger (And my heart was beatin' fast)

I got plenty, it's so many, yeah
They say, "Gimme," he got plenty, yeah

// Neck & Wrist //

[Pusha T:]
You supposed to put the first five hundred in the safe and lose the combination
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

First in the Beach with a million-dollar auto
Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narco
812 matte black, lookin' like charcoal
I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
[Pharrell Williams:]
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

[Pusha T:]
The money counter ding is so exciting
Summertime, Winterfell, I'm the Night King
The Colgate kilo, the hood needs whitening (Skrrt)
We fishscale niggas like we all Pisces
Your bitch in my bubble like I'm still typing
She hopin' that you let her go like a kite string
Your eco-friendly jewelers, you keep recycling
Cartier bustdowns just not my thing
The B in the center of that left and right wing
The only time you'll ever see me next to Breitling (Skrrt)
Wonder where this started from, the facts are frightening
Richard Pryor's flame gave birth to pipe dreams, now we here

First in the Beach with a million-dollar auto
Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narco
812 matte black, lookin' like charcoal
I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
[Pharrell Williams:]
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
(And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line
And the dope house had a line, dope house had a line)

[Jay-Z:]
The phase I'm on, love, I wouldn't believe it either
I'd be like, "JAY-Z's a cheater," I wouldn't listen to reason either
All I know is he's a felon, how is he sellin'?
Weed, the Caliva brothers, deep down, I believe you love us, huh
Feast your eyes, the piece unique, it's sapphire
Rappers liars, I don't do satire
Neither I nor my wrist move mockingly
Y'all spend real money on fake watches, shockingly
They put me on lists with these niggas inexplicably
I put your mansion on my wall, are you shittin' me?
I blew bird money, y'all talkin' Twitter feed
We got different Saab stories, save your soliloquies
They like, "If BIG was alive, Hov wouldn't be in his position"
If BIG had survived, y'all would have got The Commission
Hov was gon' always be Hov
It 'twas the universe will 'cause Allah said so, and now I'm here

[Pusha T:]
First in the Beach with a million-dollar auto
Bring the cameraman, we can shoot our own Narco
812 matte black, lookin' like charcoal
I promise you the floor plan's nothin' like the model
[Pharrell Williams:]
Neck and wrist don't lie
Neck and wrist don't lie

// Just So You Remember //

As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealing with
The number don't change, I know who the chemist is
Brick by brick, we kept open dealerships
Mitch by mitch, we built up our villages
Seeing you rappers apply for the stimulus
Living a lie but die for your images
It's guns involved like cowboys and Indians
You Trackhawk niggas are not my equivalent
Flew your bitch to Cuba for the thrill of it
But I ain't go, to show you what you shoulda did
Ten inch chains to hide all my blemishes
My Joker smile, you know who the villain is

Just so you remember who you dealing with
Look outside, the landscape ridiculous
Motion lights surrounded meticulous
Architectural Digest my premises
She just spent a million on the finishes
Millionaires were made out of middlemen
That hole in the attic was not for a ceiling fan
Army Celine, the wardrobe is militant
And army fatigue when I talk pyramids

Just so you remember who you dealin' with
The purest snow we sellin' white privilege
Designer drugs will turn niggas limitless
Designer clothes, these hoes losing innocence
The book of blow, just know I'm the Genesis

As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight?
It's only Monday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Just so you remember who you dealin' with
His Pyrex talks but I'm the ventriloquist
Language different, I'm damn near an immigrant
A song with any of you niggas, I'm disinterested
The needle is sharp, but they ain't shooting insulin
You missing the point, these drums ain't Timbalands

Never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

We fight for the bill, you niggas still chipping in
You Google to death, the shit I get driven in
My boys in the hood is mixed with the menaces
The cane is sugar and cut by Dominicans
Open the box, it's like ten Christmases
My folks in the box is serving life sentences
I've lived in a world that never leaves witnesses
Just so you remember who you dealin' with

Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

// Diet Coke //

Yesterday's price is not today's price
Like, like-like, crack-crack, like, like
Like, li-li-crack, crack, crack

Imaginary players ain't been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
Everybody get it off the boat, right?
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?
If your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life
Missy was our only misdemeanor
My tunnel vision's better under stove lights
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
My workers compensated so they don't strike

Wish me luck, see green like Don Bishop
The ones you trust don't change like them chains you tuck
Far as I'm concerned, who's the best? Me and Yezos
Wash, then dry, so give me all of mine in pesos
Add it up (Add it up)
Your bitches in them pictures but they laser-taggin' us
They mad at us, who wouldn't be?
We became everything you couldn't be
Everything your mama said you shouldn't be
The Porsche's horses revvin', like, "Look at me"
Saddle up
I'm still pitchin', baby, batter up

Imaginary players ain't been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
All you niggas get it off the boat, right?
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?
If your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life

The flow's untouched, the drums is tucked
Drive Cullinan when roads get rough
Snow's a must, the nose adjust
Young Gs like we Hov and Puff
Best jewelries and hoes we lust
Chanel trinkets and hoes'll blush
Crush hearts like pretty boys
And we drivin' pretty toys
Extendos will make plenty noise
Crescendo make your car endo
Pierce your car window
Missy was our only misdemeanor
Nike box hold a hundred thou' with no insoles, uh
The crack era was such a black era
How many still standin' reflectin' in that mirror?
Lucky me

Imaginary players ain't been coached right
Master recipes under stove lights
The number on this jersey is the quote price
You ordered Diet Coke, that's a joke, right?
All you niggas get it off the boat, right?
But only I can really have a snow fight
Detroit nigga challenge, what's your dope like?
If your Benz bigger, step it up to Ghost life

// Rock N Roll //

[Beyoncé:]
If I ain't got nothin'—
If I ain't got nothin'—
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two

[Kid Cudi:]
Yeah, I'm sayin' somethin', they want it the old way (Yeah)
Comin' down the block, the windows are so hazy (Yeah)
Never said, "I can't," my nigga, there's no way (No way)
Every time we wild, that's rock n' roll, baby

[Pusha T:]
It's back to the basics, hopped back in the matrix
Gave the Maybach back, back, now it's off to the races
Had 'em tappin' my phones, so I blurred out the faces
The new David Ruffin, I just follow Temptation
When you follow The Rager, the money is outrageous
Look at me, legally sellin' dope on all of these stages
Van Cleef & Arpels, V got all of the bracelets
The keys and the codes, and know where all of the safes is
We don't make mistakes here, we don't take no breaks here
My son is like a work of art, his father's like Shakespeare
I've done the impossible, I should wear a cape here
A "C" on my chest, coke dealers, come and play here
Career's in it's eighth gear, nothin' left to do but levitate
I'm David Blaine here, I could disappear, I swear
We been gettin' change here, so what's really changed here?
Still next to Ye in here

[Kid Cudi:]
Yeah, I'm sayin' somethin', they want it the old way (Yeah)
Comin' down the block, the windows are so hazy (Yeah)
Never said, "I can't," my nigga, there's no way (No way)
Every time we wild, that's rock n' roll, baby
This is my story, and yes, you should pay me (Uh)
Told her, "I ain't stayin' the night," she might hate me (No)
Life is where it's been, where they not, it's so crazy
Every time we wild, it's rock n' roll, baby

[Pusha T:]
We the only clique takin' risk
Touchin' live, fuck your hits
Touch the skies when you rich
Every drop make 'em blitz
I'd done drove every six
I'd done glowed every wrist
Every plot got a twist, when you sink a battleship
I'm confused by your list
Who are you's to convince?
All the mules that I sent
What'd I miss?
I been gettin' at these coins as I'm breakin' down the brick
Make the jump to each level, Super Mario exists
All the spoons that were bent, all the fumes through the vents
I don't care what they do, this ain't that, that ain't this
I'm the trap, I'm the fix, I'm the broker, I'm The Joker
In the deck, Arthur Fleck, when he's pissed, triple six

[Kanye West:]
I accepted you the lie
All the times, selfish, thinking you was mine
I showed up, then you arrived, I thought I could turn the tides
How I make it through the Chi', get to you, and almost die?
Finally tired of comin' and goin', make up your mind
I ain't come to pick up the kids to pick a fight
Goin' off all of the time, showin' off all of the time
Pushing me over the edge, don't know if I'm fallin' or flyin'
How many nights I pray, how many times?
No matter what we say, God will decide, God will decide
Call the divine, stars will align, stars will align
Love my mama, but sometimes, Dad was right
Take his hand, hold on with all of your might
When you're lost in the light, call on the light
Follow the signs, walk in the shine

[Kid Cudi:]
See, I'm losin' time
See, I really wanna live my life, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more
See a nigga try, yeah, oh, it never dries, oh
See, I want more, I want more, I want more

[Beyoncé:]
If I ain't got nothin'—
If I ain't got nothin'—
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two
If I ain't got nothin'—
If I ain't got nothin'—
One plus one, plus one, plus one
Plus one, plus one, plus one equals two

// Call My Bluff //

Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff

Buffalo shrimps from Mahi Mah's
Coke deals upstairs at the Ramada
The ocean from motels was popular
And crack was cemented phenomenon
Elected Presidential was on my arm
Red stripe Pradas and on and on
Driving a fiend car dangerous, extremely armed
Shout to the Branch's, Antoine and Sean
Some niggas play different, involve your mom
Sister, aunt, niece, duct tape them all
We only in the sport to be LeBrons
When you used to platinum, that gold be bronze
Your favorite rapper's dressing like Comic-Con
These necklaces is different from charm to charm
Buried drug money from lawn to lawn
We learned from the wizards and Poppa Ron's

Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff

Calling my bluff, gon' answer, "Hello"
Service with a smile when I hand out halos
Shotclock shooters, when I point 'em, they go
Now everybody asking "What happened?" They know (They know...)
Rather watch the sunset in Turks and Caicos
Eating conch fritters with chips and queso's
Don't make me call my TTG's with Draco's
Who all got amnesia until the case closed
Sometimes I wish my fanbase was more like J. Cole's
But dope boys gotta be the man like they know
How many more car faxes must get exposed?
Imaginary shipments, fictitious payloads
You should listen to them on the platforms they on
The villains, the killings, no ceilings, I yawn
Niggas acting like we can't pop up, hey Yawn
We specialize in not getting locked up, Akon
"Haha, I don't feel like they get that!"

Everything don't need to be addressed
The pull-up's like a FedEx truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff
Wake your ass up where you rest
On time like a Amazon truck
I can send some niggas 'round there right now
1-800 call my bluff

// Scrape It Off //

I just scraped it off the top (cut it)
Cut it off the road, off the curb, off the block (cut it)
I was already sold out of work by ten o'clock (cut it)
Too deep in the streets, felt that pain, but it meant a lot

Yeah, I'm off the chain, I'm off the noose (the noose)
Yeah, get 'em picked off, Bentley white like cotton (cotton)
Presidential so good, my doors don't gotta lock 'em
Wash the dirty money with the Oxy
I miscount 'cause I'm off an Oxy

Yeah, these niggas faker than a damn proxy
Callin' my shooter he said, "Copy"
Get that nigga plucked like a boogie
I like riches hit like noogies
How the fuck you ain't scared of no nigga
But you scared to put on your hoodie? (Yo' hoodie)
Man, my buzz light like Woody

I just scraped it off the top (cut it)
Cut it off the road, off the curb, off the block (cut it)

// Hear Me Clearly //

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me

These drug dealer Rollies is my TikTok and Triller
Insecure bitches get lip fillers
Covered in white like bridezilla
And never been caught
So what's the Shiggy dance for a brick nigga?
Extracurricular
Art buyer, eight twelve 'Rari driver
Spent six just to make the roof Harry Potter
Kilogram Kickstarter push a brick harder
Left my elbow in the pot à la Vince Carter
Compared to two martyrs but I'm chasing moguls
Bosses meet for Hamachi in the back of Nobu
No phones allowed, no phones allowed
Cell towers gon' ping from the nearest cloud
My JanSporters, my transporters and Jan's daughter
Who put up extra bed sheets to block the camcorders
You place orders, I hedge bets
Promises are when you follow through with your threats, nigga

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales

Buy your bitch a Richard Mille
If she like Meeks, let no nigga claim rich and let 'em buy you sneaks
Wish upon a star, that's beyond your reach
Or you can lay with him in misery and grind your teeth
Let a brick nigga help you find your peace
G Wagon your seats, Gs cover your pleats
Ten toes down, Loewe cover the cleats
Dope sell itself, got a trunk full of receipts
Is you lookin' for me or are we lookin' for Meech?
Stand on my standards, expanded with the Ziploc
Even if a nigga number better, never clique hop
Never tell a jeweler what you spent for your wristwatch
And we don't fuck bitches who fuck niggas on TikTok
See the difference 'tween me and them?
I move to a different drum like EDM
This coke speaks to my soul like a medium
Fucking comedians

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales

Hear me clearly, if y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales

// Open Air //

Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there
You ready

Out on the balcony
Goats and shit
Just got the word that the coast is clear
So I'mma send it down the coast and load it there
Imagine hangin' on a prayer knowing dope's in there
All that frontin' in your raps, you holdin' where?
We turnin' on the lights, you roaches clear
Parking lots, cemetery his ghost is there
Independent how I feel, the chauffer's there
Why would I do a turkey drive, then troll the mayor
When we feed the projects for most of the year
See my heart been black, ain't no hope in here
And we been let down by who's supposed to care
Me and Steven, gold wings, see those is rare
Ain't no Tony's in my circles, we Sosa's here
In these ten crack commandments, I'm Moses yeah
ARs do your body like folding chairs
Sit down

Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there

Bricks like blocks of government cheese
Seven hundred for the Japanese dungarees
VVS V12s don't fuck with my Vs
Highest price hood bitches that scuff up they knees
Finally made your first million but what's it to me
Million dollar dog collar I'm pluckin' you fleas
See none of those barkin' can fuck with the tree
And when they legalize that, the discussion's with me
Paris Le Meurice, The sprawling suite
His Cartier, her wrist Van Cleef
Exes deceased
AKA rest in peace
Her mother's worst fear is you die in the streets
Seventeen mind changes up under my seat
Jean-Georges reservations I'm dyin' to eat
Then we toast with Sancerre, a sigh of relief
Watch you niggas blow it all just trynna compete

Sellin' cocaine in the open air
The boats is there
The notes is there
Yeah, the ropes is there

// I Pray For You //

I pray for my enemies
I pray for my friends
I pray for the one who won't betray me again
I pray for the killers
I pray for the saints
Please pray for me now
Cause darling, I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you
I pray for you

Rarely do you see the Phoenix rise from the ashes
Lightning struck twice on four classics
Self-preservation, we separate ourselves from the plastic
The ankle of my sweat still elastic
Still do gymnastics
If Hov's still forever young, then I'ma somersault backwards through these chapters
Land in the soft white
Cook it till it's off white
They questionin' my score card
Hold it to a torch light
I hid it in the porch light
See I had the foresight
My 911 was pullin' up to matchin' Porsche night
The married drug dealer, even named my son Brixx
He raps what he lives so fuck the nanny gon' sit
It's the grown man in me
Searchin' for the plug, that's the nomad in me
Still the X factor that's the Rohan in me
Reluctantly a role model
They drown in too many gold bottles
Harold Melvin without the blue note
The past ten years, screaming "Uno!"
Then side step back into the duo
The kings of the Pyrex
I'm my brother's keeper, if you listen and you dissect
All I talk is money if you listen to my dialect
Bitch I shot Grindin' in my momma's momma's projects
I'm just being honest with you, how is that for context
You can live forever when the shit you write is timeless
We gon' live forever 'cause the shit we write is timeless

Tell me what I missed
New designer drugs and emotions I don't get
I know hellcats still paddle when I shift
Vietnam, flashbacks, I get triggered by a sniff
Today's top fives only strengthenin' my myth
Build our own Rushmore just from chiselin' a brick
Still fightin' demons, see that curse is now my gift
Secrets die with me that's as deep as the abyss, that is no coincidence
When I was in the mix, opened up your nose like I'm cuttin' it with Vicks
Slavin' over stoves like I rub together sticks
Paved another road so my soul would co-exist
But heaven only knows I won't dig another ditch
In a suit and tie like you puttin' on the ritz
Three record deals show me ignorance is bliss
Tryna milk a game that is only 2%
X told you hell is hot, I told you repent
Faith never waivered as I walked along the fence
Faith could move mountains so what are you up against
Walk my brother 'round you bitches, I know he pretends
I greet you with the love of God but that don't make us friends
I might whisper in his ear "bury all of them"
Light another tiki torch and carry it again
Back up on my high horse is chariots again
Put the ring back on her finger, marry it again
