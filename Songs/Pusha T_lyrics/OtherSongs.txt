// Black Moses //

[Priscilla Renea:]
I been workin' all day, hmmm 'til the sun go down
Back hurt, feet hurt, but I still got to work
Who gonna save me? Hmmm, break every chain, hmmm
Take me away from this place and leave me work

Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be

Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

[Pusha T:]
Kill 'em, that's the minimal, only way to fend 'em off
Leave 'em sittin' at death's door, proper way to send 'em off
They'll just beat me 'til the sin is off or my skin is off
Some tried to run, they got tracked down, now our limit's off
I'm just tryna find the North, let the stars design the course
Hope the mud can hide my scent, pray the night can slow they horse
Got me shackled up in chains, even made me change my name
But they couldn't trap my mind, this cry for freedom ain't in vain
See they taught us half the story, didn't know we came from glory
Years ago we was kings before the boats came and load me
Woo, gotta keep runnin', gotta keep runnin'
Yeah cause they keep gunnin', and they keep comin'

[Priscilla Renea:]
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be

Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

[Meek Mill:]
Slaves, on the North side of Philly
Where they tell their mamas
And go spend that money they made on designer
We shoot at our brothers but run from the coppas
In front of your honor
Beggin' for freedom, if freedom got free in it
Why it ain't free than
We go get a lawyer, a liar, that's descent to meet with the District Attorney agreement
Like take it or leave it, leave it or take it
If we for the takin
I'm finna go straight for the win, (winnin', winnin', winnin')
We started as slaves, we came up from nothin'
If I could live twice, I'd do it again
Again and again, again and again
Who gon' love your momma on them drugs
Little babies that was never loved
So they run into the corner store
Quarter water only time they get a hug
Get some cocoa, only time they get some work
Say that it be poppin' on the first
He was poppin' when he had the money
'Til they popped him, now he ridin' in a hearse
This is real shit, nigga, not a verse
People really, really outta work
Kids starving somethin gotta work
Preacher even trappin' out the church
Put them shackles on my arm and leg
All them days made my body hurt
Locked my brothers all up in the cage
So we turn to prayer, hoping God will work

[Priscilla Renea:]
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be

Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

// Cold Blooded //

[Swizz Beatz:]
This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
Yeah, it cold blooded
Hit everything in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold blooded, hah

[Pusha T:]
Black child born in the storm
They had to bundle up to stay warm, bodega babies
Strollers in the snow to the candy lady
That sugar made the monsters of the Nineties crazy
Child rebel soldiers of the inner city
They hate me now, tigers next to Nas and Diddy
His momma fell in love with drug-dealin' Diddy
The only star left that was next to Biggie
Little did she know, she was one of four
And little did he know, he was one of eight
Unknown siblings all through middle school
With the same mean mug that was born from hate
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the Nineties crazy
Hide and go seek when their father's lazy
And their mommas only want the early Nineties JAY-Z's

[Swizz Beatz:]
This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
Yeah, it cold blooded
Hit everything in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold blooded, hah

[Pusha T:]
They said his skin wasn't light enough
And his future wasn't bright enough
Little sister don't talk much
'Cause they uncle had the Midas touch
Evil is as evil does
Momma looked away, blamed it on his needle buzz
Sold his food out the freezer when he needed drugs
Beggin' like he Cool J when he needed love
Yeah, bodega babies
You wonder why these kids of the Nineties crazy
Broken black homes is the modern slavery
You can't raise a savage and deny the rabies
Woo, bodega babies
Yeah, bodega babies
How loud I got to scream for someone to save me
And now I'm in this cell from everything you made me

[Swizz Beatz:]
This city cold blooded, ah
Yeah, it cold blooded
Your neck too soft, put a knife to it
Funeral rooms on it, got your wife too it, hoo
The city cold blooded
Up in here, who want it, huh?
Yeah, it cold blooded
Hit everything in the daylight, huh?
Police ain't comin' for some hours
Niggas ain't really talkin' for some hours
You gon' die if you try to take ours
Boy, we cold blooded, hah

// Coming Home //

[Pusha T:]
Uh, ah, fuck it, we all poor
Even if you got money, still lookin' for more
Why am I buyin' Rollies? I got 20 for sure
Still connect with you, it's still hid in the drawer
With no Js on, I'm still lookin' to score
You see they gave us crack, then started wagin' a war
Uh, all these lies, they steady tellin' me
Before Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C
The '80s kingpins, gotta free them
All these faces, they ain't believe in
If no child's left, then how can we leave them?

[Lauryn Hill:]
When love is gone, you hold onto anything
Some do wrong, just to feel anything
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything
(You can do anything)

[Pusha T:]
Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street-corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback mamis, that won't retire
Reminiscin' on the days
When the trips was CancÃºn and the bottles got sprayed
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Nah, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear
Y'all was breakin' into cars, we was breakin' bad
When y'all was fightin' dogs, we was racin' Jags
This the life for the fast
Ain't no future, ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrush backdrops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone
Let 'em know it's still snowin'

[Lauryn Hill:]
When love's withdrawn, you hold onto anything
(You hold onto anything)
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
(They have to do anything)
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
(You stand up to anything)
When love is real (When love is real)
You can do anything (You can do anything)

[Pusha T:]
I'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who weren't taught the golden rule, but they made do
Free lunches and apple juices, uh
Food stamps, ashamed to use 'em
You ever lived with the user?
Shared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose 'em

[Lauryn Hill:]
New plan, but it's a new day
Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free, in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yes, it's just started, it's just started

When love is strong, you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you'll stand up to anything
(But you'll stand up to anything)
'Cause when the void is filled, you can do anything
(When the void is filled)
When the love is real, you can do anything

// Dame 6 //

[Pusha T:]
Real ballers, they love it
Rollie faces, they flood it
This diamond life is like dynamite
Explosive and it's cold blooded
My handles can't be trusted
Cross you up so disgusting
No splash brothers, I slash brothers
Shower Posse like Dudus
See I got a thousand cousins
I was focused when y'all wasn't
You played the sport, I played the porch
I served it straight out my oven
While y'all was out there clubbin'
I ran suicides in the dungeon
No plain kicks in my Dame 6
I showed them all who they wasn't

[Pharrell Williams:]
Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard)
Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard)
CHING!

[Pusha T:]
The closer
Shake your head off your shoulders
And ankle break his opponents
Cross you up, hocus pocus
This Oakland kid is a soldier
They said it's no one that's colder
They say is heart is like polar
'Cause he will hit the game winner
Bye, bye, it was nice to know ya

[Pusha T:]
Adidas (Watch this, watch this, yeah)
Dame 6 (I've been ballin', yeah)
King Push
Watch this, watch this, yeah

[Pharrell Williams:]

Watch this, watch this, yeah

Watch this, watch this, yeah

// Dancing With The Devil //

(Romano)
(OG Parker)

[Landstrip Chip:]
Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)
Gotta charge it to the game
They would stab me in my back every time if I would let 'em
Heart cold, so I went rose gold diamonds on my bezel
Ain't never get mad, just went up another level
Yeah, I've been dancing with the devil

[Babyface Ray:]
Watch 'em flock when you having your way
They say love get you killed, gotta die anyway
Thugs got feelings too, had to stand in the rain
I'm disguisin' the pain, traumatized from the game
Yeah, elevators going straight to the penthouse, you gon' see the same faces when you comin' down
I put some money to the side for a big house, I told my mama, "I don't never wanna see you frown"
I've been spendin' time alone 'cause these niggas clowns
And these hoes hands out, ain't got shit to give 'em
I do everything they ask, how am I the villain?
Weight was placed on my back, I was forced to lift it
Weight was placed on my back, I was forced to lift it
I still pull 'em in when it's scorchin', nigga
Gotta pray for my soul 'cause it's torture really
Still sippin' drank 'cause my pain runnin' deep

[Landstrip Chip:]
Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)
Gotta charge it to the game
They would stab me in my back every time if I would let 'em
Heart cold, so I went rose gold diamonds on my bezel
Ain't never get mad, just went up another level
Yeah, I've been dancing with the devil

[Pusha T:]
She hop in every flight, she fuckin' who she want
Take the words out your mouth just before it leave your tongue
Bottega from her purse to her pumps
Heart eyes every first of the month
Sugar daddy, she call me honey bun
Paper cuts, had to mummy-wrap my thumbs
It's no fun when the rabbit got the gun
Hundred carats and my Uzi weighs a ton
Baby, you can't use him when his money flowing fluid
And he's into prostitution
See, I buy Birkins, so my drive-bys worth it
And I'm gon' spend it 'cause I'm not perfect
So share my world and tell me what's these purchases
When you've been the wave and them bricks still surfin' it?
Detroit niggas claimin' turf again
Me and Babyface Ray cookin' work again, gone

[Landstrip Chip:]
Sippin' all this drank make it hard for me to think
Diamonds on my chain just to cover up this pain (Yeah)
If I ain't have a thing, would you still treat me the same? (Huh?)
Gotta charge it to the game
They would stab me in my back every time if I would let 'em
Heart cold, so I went rose gold diamonds on my bezel
Ain't never get mad, just went up another level
Yeah, I've been dancing with the devil

(This Chicago, nigga)

They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathin' like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I'd never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep, I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatin' good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissin' girls, 'cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on, then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hangin' out the window, it's 'bout to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shoutout to L-E-P, Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
(Young Chop on the beat)

Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screamin', "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!" (Sosa)
I don't want relations, I just want one night (One night)
'Cause a thirsty bitch, that's that shit that I don't like (Nah)
I got tats up on my arm 'cause this shit is life (That's life, tatted)
And I stunt so much in clothes 'cause I'm livin' life (Life, Louis, Gucci)
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right (300)
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Right now)
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like (Chief Keef)
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like (Chi-Town, D-Town, you know?)

Whoa, we are not one and the same
Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doin' the same
Shit, not doin' what you sayin', dang
I told yo' old bitch she was fuckin' a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holdin' that pain

Ridin' for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these low-lives

She never let me hit (Nah), she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother thirty for the Jesus (Uh-huh)
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

// Drug Dealers Anonymous //

[Pusha T:]
Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it's ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde Mohawk the collection I'm Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
'Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America's nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin's got a tint
And I can't even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18-wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life's a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like '86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God's got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing
The ultimate misdirection ya

[Tomi Lahren:]
Your husband was a drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack cocaine

[Jay Z:]
Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Bitch I been brackin' since the '80s
Google me baby, you crazy
'89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google's your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
IRS should've had the townhouses surrounded
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that's for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it's like multiple choices
I told 'em pull the Royce up
I'm getting ghost, I'm hearing noises
I think it's the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries 'em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Bling bling
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley 'bout me
Ask the Federalis 'bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, "Gimme 12"
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y'all think Uber's the future, our cars been autonomous
Mules move the drums, take 'em to different spots
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
I'm a course of miracles with this shit
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn't find a decent job
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin' with my right, whipping white with my left wrist
Damn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through

Beef is best served like steak: well-done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
'Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health

Beef is best served like steak: well-done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas

Don't listen to 'em, Desiigner
The same rappers talkin' next year will be Uber drivers (Fuck 'em)
Chanel dad hats, but you don't know that they got 'em
Trap door shopper, they rotate the wall
So you will never see me as you rotate the mall
330 spin, cook a steak up on this grill
Me myself and I, we like a hamster in the wheel
Rolls emblem, Black Virginian
Pull in a neighborhood I don't blend in
Album of the year contender every year
The kitchen's full of work, it's blenders everywhere
Blended bitches everywhere that do the most
They never seen with him so they fuck his ghost
Invisible man, timepiece with the invisible hands
MJ, remember the time they counted in sand hourglass
But mine come with purse and heels
And the DIY Gucci with the crest and shields
It's too far gone when the realest ain't real
I walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain't real
These niggas Call of Duty 'cause their killings ain't real
With a questionable pen so the feelin' ain't real
Rap's John Grisham
I can paint the picture with the words if you listen (shh)
The bar's been lowered, the well's run dry
They beefin' over melodies, but no, not I (yugh)
See I'm so top 5
If they factor in the truth I just might blow by
Blobama

// HAHA //

Ayo, N-I-N-E turn that up

[Al-Doms:]
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws

The greatest rapper of them all response my mirror on the wall
Bitches come work these crystal balls
And see what future they was drawn
It's blood sports to win it all
We kick this bitch like we Jean Claude
I'm only here to get a water, I ain't fallin' [?]
Trust these rubber bands and see what they expand too
Bitch, up my hunnids
Made the beat blow birthday candles, make a wish
Feel like Marlon Wayan, why you raisin' prices on the brick?
I empathize my life legit and put my niggas in positions
It can't fall apart if I patch it up like Slick Rick
Ten gold chains around my neck, look like a slave's privilege
They act shook, we etch-a-sketch and draw arms and stretch the Benz
Leave the scene with no more drama, sing Amiri's best hits
If I was made to be your karma, you deserve that shit
'Cause I'm an angel to my momma, but to rap is triple-six, yeugh

Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws, ugh
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Look, check my repertoire
It's a plane, it's a God, bitches dime, see no flaws

I put my key, you put your key in
Money we'll be seein'
To scrape the fuckin' ceilin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I put my key, you put your key in
Money we'll be seein'
To scrape the fuckin' ceilin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh

[Pusha T:]
Niggas said I died, I was dead to the streets
Fuck 'em, I'm gettin' high, gettin' head on the beach
G-Wagon your Jeep, Nobu on the beach
Never did Philippes, it's PF Chang's to me
Numbers don't lie when you who they came to see
And the wrist don't lie when the watch is made for he
My yellow brick road was twenty-five a key
The road to the riches was always paved for me
Chillin', sittin' on double digit millions
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Life's a bitch, even Rihanna made a billion
All from sellin' powder, made a killin'
Pusha

Ha-ha-ha-ha

// In This Ho (Lambo) //

Oh my God I'm in this ho, oh my God I'm in this ho
Yeah I'm fucking that centerfold
Fuck you all in my business for
You ain't talking 'bout getting dough
You ain't talking 'bout getting more
Lakers - Heat, camera seats
That's the difference between rich and poor
Recognize I jeopardize that top spot and they testify
They ate first and I'm next in line
We back to back and he pass baton
I put my chest at that finish line
This art money, this Renaissance
My chain heavy, it's winter time
See all colors, this Benetton

That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Riding in that Lambo, riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo

Assault rifles in the back like Rambo

[Swizz Beatz:]
Vroom, vroom, I ride around like wheels
Swizz, I'm back up on my shit
Haters, got to suck the dick
Ah, y'all can get them clips
I'm riding around in that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
White seats on that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Rare form, I'm in rare action
Came back I'm like Michael Jackson
Woo! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute, let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas I'll slow it down
I gets the paper you know it now
I gets the paper you know it now
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
But I'm 'bout to get another one, you little bastards

// Lights Please //

[Khi Infinite:]
Working from the sun up to sun down
I'm praying that my dreams don't fail me now
I'm looking up to God to help me out
Get rid of the facades around me
Would you lift me up when a nigga down
Would you throw shade on me when I'm not around
If you was my kin then why you so in and out
You switched up so I took a different route

Hmm, ah, hmm-hmm, ah
Hmm, ah, hmm-hmm, ah

Ain't no nigga like me, hyphy
Sounding like a type beat, lights, please
Turn it up, ignite me, pricey
Money come in siamese
Don't come crawling back unless you're lacing up the Nikes

Bitch, I came to win
God threw me the alley-oop, I caught it off the rim
How can I be jaded when them hunnids coming in
Talking out your neck but I ain't taking no offense
Once again, bitch, I'm jumping out the gym
You could never be like this, I took a risk
Knew I had to turn it up, I flipped the switch
Once I cracked the code it's when I knew I couldn't miss

Hmm, ah, hmm-hmm, ah
Hmm, ah, hmm-hmm, ah

Ain't no nigga like me, hyphy

You can ask your sidepiece, they hope you invite me
Everything is Gucci, so you know I'm icy
Rolling like I'm geeked up, yeah, bitch, I might be
He selling you pipe dreams, he taking you sightseeing
Welcome to this yacht life, said you was a Pisces
I know what excites you, you know what ignites me
Big bodies, drop tops, traveling at light speed
Solitaire, solid hare, time freeze
Flight numbers, baggage claims, palm trees
Kelly bags, heavy tags on me, it's on me

Ain't no nigga like me, hyphy

// Lost In The World (Remix) //

[Sample From "Woods": Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my line
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my line
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my line
I'm building a still to slow down the time

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Look at my situation, I couldn't ask for more
I'm the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
Look what that kilo sent me
That Porsche's keyless entry
That girl is high and drunk I swear the rest is elementary
We found a superfreak, no, she won't know what hit her
I'm on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You've got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don't get good dick too often, I'm 'a have you funny walking
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off it
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
Run from the lights
Run from the lights
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night

[Gil-Scott Heron:]
Us living as we do upside down. And the new word to have is "revolution". People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued. And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey. The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys. America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes. The signs of truth were tattooed across our open-ended vagina. We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal. Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed-down daily with a gagging perfume. America was a bastard the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom. Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch. What does Webster say about soul? All I want is a good home and a wife, and a children and some food to feed them every night. After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

// Misfit Toys //

I declare war
On anybody standing in the way of what I dream for
How could you ignore
The ones that are voiceless, screams from the poor
They only here to score
I do it for the underground kings that'll need more
I'm kickin' down your door
If I wonder why you got a pocket full of green for (Rrah)
It's all about the get back
It's hard to give back while the politicians kick back
They say I'm only brick rap
Well, that's the foundation of this mountain that I live at
I can get you kidnapped
These kids ain't playin' with you, actin' like you live rap
And all those little mishaps
That only happen to you, misfits, I'm here to fix that (Yeah)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this game
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Rich get richer while the poor pickpocket
Swipes Maxwell 'til the cops come knockin'
Have or have not, bein' broke is not an option
Time after time when you got a thing for watches
When you the plug in the socket (Yes)
And the powers that be can't stop it
So obnoxious, borderline toxic
Both sides go to war like a mosh pit (Yeah)
Now let me switch up the optics
Our neighborhoods held us hostage (That's real)
Some nights we slept in our closets (That's real)
Gun fights was outside the projects (Brrah)
So you can't blame me for nonsense
I'm here to collect deposits
All else defies the logic
My people need me beside them (Now)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this game
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits
Come play with the misfits
Don't play with the misfits
Come and play with the misfits

I told you don't play with the misfits
Must be deaf dumb and blind you a triplet
Don't you make me erase your existence
All by my lonely need no assistance
Any disrespect gets met with a vengeance
Burn down gossip and hidden agendas
We set the tone for all to remember
You rewrite history, the greatest pretenders
(You rewrite history, the greatest pretenders; brrah)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this game
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits
Come play with the misfits (Yes)
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Pusha
Hoo

[Pusha T:]
They noddin' and dozin'
They sit there frozen, in awe
The train track scars on their arm
All because the stamp on the bag wasn't charged
The same thing that took down DeBarge
Get it off the barge, floatin' through the waterways
Didn't need Italians, now they got a war to wage
When the product's pure, you're the one they oughta pay
Sugar Hill sweet, like his daddy-daughter days, yeugh
The line around the corner like Six Flags
The potency of one of mine equal to six bags
I done watched brothers kill brothers for nick' bags
The dope lean have a nigga parked like a kickstand
I'm the Bump Johnson of rap, Harlem Renaissance
I provide the fix, and y'all live on, son
The secret's in the mix, I sell it a la carte
I peddle everything you want, motherfucker

[Swizz Beatz:]
I ain't got no patience (Patience)
This clip and this barrel guaranteed to make you famous (Goddamn)
Man, we make you brainless
The mask, the gloves, god damn, man, I'm dangerous (C'mon)

[Pusha T:]
Needles, noses
Dosage after dosage
Until the cell closes
'Til the casket gets filled with the ghosts
On the face that shows no emotion
I'm sellin' love potion, Chanel No. 9
The sins camouflage, but it ain't hard to find
Poppy flowers are a gold mine
Poppy guaranteed, up until the goal line, woo
On every corner like a stop light
Makes it hard stayin' out the spotlight
Numbers up and down, you better shop right
It's a vest and two guns when we shop nights
Hell up in Harlem, lotta problem solvers
Lotta dope dealers, lotta money launderers
Real go-getta, if you ain't know, nigga
We came to put locks on blocks to show niggas

[Swizz Beatz:]
Hey, I ain't got no patience (Patience)
This clip and this barrel guaranteed to make you famous (Goddamn)
Man, we make you brainless
The mask, the gloves, god damn, man, I'm dangerous (C'mon)
I ain't got no patience (Patience)

// No Problem //

If I am the problem
Then you cannot solve it
You live in the crosshairs
When you are the target
It's hard to stay underground
The brighter your star gets
From sun up to sundown
I'm glowing regardless
We came with the mission
To corner the market
To take it, you gotta be heartless
One of the hardest, ah

I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
Watch when you play with God
I got the TEC and the squad coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh

Dead or alive, I'm wanted
Just like a ghost, I'm haunted
I'm callin' the shots, you callin' the cops
The Angel of Death is upon us
It's not a threat, it's a promise
Killing at will if we honest
I tell you, no lie, it's Jekyll and Hyde
When you are like one with the monsters
I am the problem (yugh)
I got the power (yugh)
I got the pull, I run with the bulls
You run with the cowards
This thing of prowess (yes), this thing is ours (yes)
I put out the hit, your funeral's lit
I show up with flowers

I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
Watch when you play with God
I got the TEC and the squad coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh

// Ooh //

[Hodgy Beats:]
Prometh flow for the slow sippers
And if you on your paper chasing, I'ma roll with ya
About an onion, it odors a bag of Funyuns
Bitches packaging dozens, fuck 'em until they malfunction
I laugh my ass off, taking shots like a gunman
I don't hunt game, motherfucker, I hunt men
Take 'em to the back of my pick-up truck to rot them
Kill a fuckin' superhero, I watch the Watchmen
I'm a super-negro, my watch the rocks in
My Glock that's cocked, loaded, and ready to lock in
Who's sending niggas to the dirt? Ostriches
Captain holding them captive fucking hostages
Create carnage from cartridges, eating the heart of pigs
To murder, homicide's a part to live with that
Grab your Teflon, ammunition, and your gat
Unless you wanna get shitted on like porn scat

[Pusha T:]
Ooh, you ain't sayin' nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera

Hey Hodgy, hey Tyler, don't mind us

In all black Versace dressed in the finest)
We sell it all, even the drugs are designers
Gangster bitches, Red Monkeys for the ecstasy
(Fuck it, take 'em all, overdose the recipe
Let them hoes show their true colors) crew lovers
Passed around like a cold (It's a zoo of us)
Two brothers, add two others just the news of it
Make the net crash, the ultimate "Who done it?"
(And who knew Sarah Palin with the sniff type daughter knocked up
But she was knocking down Glen Rice)
Been nice since the Wolf Gang was baby pups
(Golf Wang full grown, now they're crazy fucks)
Add two dope boys known for taping up
(Kick in the door, now the world ain't safe enough)

[Pusha T:]
Ooh, you ain't sayin' nada

Spit bars, this hard, teen sixteen bars
I'm fucking the game when its vagina got my dick scarred
Um, sure it's 'Preme button up floral
Stack of money, dark shades, looking like a fucking tourist
Or it's the Tourettes that my fucking neck have
I'm like a average nigga in the 20s of the 18s
And I'm not even 20, dropped a classic at my 18
A crazy motherfucker, maybe I should be my step-dad (Come here son)
The wolves finally reconcile
At Interscope office with a bunch of fucking pedophiles
While mouth watering, this shit is sick and fucking vile
Trying to fuck my destiny, they couldn't find another child

New wheels on deck, no chill, we flex
New chicks, we sex, who's up? We next
It's a race 'til the finish line
'Til all my dogs eat like it's dinner time
We spend it on light toys, dodgin' them bike boys
Flippin' them pill packs, dodgin' them bike boys

Baby mama get to buy what she want
Baby sister get to buy the free lunch
It goes down when the poverty's up, woo!
See the difference is, had to get it, no privilege
Had to take it, no middle man
Just divided up the dividends
That's drug dealer discipline, that's how you reel 'em in
Woo! For that almighty dollar
I make the whole gang follow
The only way to pop bottles
You gotta have the money and the power
We just tryna get paid

// Puppets (Succession Remix) //

If you love me, please don't judge me
Got my hands tied, the power's above me
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just a puppet here
If you wanna place blame, then look to the puppeteer

Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree

When the love's gone, and the hate's there
Better watch out, 'cause it's Cape Fear
When your family ain't your family
And your legacy is just a name there
In your mother's eyes is a blank stare
But your father's pickin' who remains here
It's a power struggle, it's a tug-of-war
That's amongst the kids, and it ain't fair
Yeugh, who gon' stop the pain?
Who gon' block the dream?
Who gon' stop the shame?
We are not the same
Walkin' a tightrope, ain't a life boat (Nope)
It's a free fall when I leave y'all (Whoa)
(If you love me, please don't judge me
Got my hands tied, the power's above me)
My bloodline was not chosen (Ooh)
This bank account is not frozen
This thing of ours is not broken
What's understood is not spoken
If you love me, please don't judge me
Don't judge me

Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy

They call me when it's time to do damage
When the quality ain't up to my standards
That McRib falls below average
Replaced by the Country Style Arby's Rib Sandwich (Woo)
Straight out the smokehouse, Texas's my old route
Eight hours to slow cook, keep push for the rollout
The boss with the Smoky Q sauce
The Real Country Style McRib kept lost, yeugh
This doesn't compare to
That replica Rib patty
I'm screaming, "How dare you?"
You know that I'm war ready
Arby's taking taste to the next level
Arby's is the choice when you won't settle
McDonald's, what you selling, mystery meat?
Hop up and go away, what does history teach?
Mickey D's, McRib, you ain't it in the streets
The Real Country Style Rib Sandwich here to compete
Look, straight out the smokehouse

Fuck a rap nigga, but she don't need him to wife her

She get a nigga cleaned up too, you need a buffer?

All she want is the monograms and my bands
Charcuteries
(Yo, what, what is charcuteries?)
Man, it's, it's when you go to your hotel room
And they got the cheese and the fucking pepperoni
Sliced on a little wood board, waiting on you
New jewelries

Nice with the Visas, passports is art

They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up

You niggas talk, she fuckin' me
Her mother sayin' she should be a nurse hurts
But she just worry 'bout who got the purse first
I tried to tell her, "Go to real estate school"
She say, ("Don't you see these fucking dealer plates, fool?
You know the rush it is to know bitches hate you
'Cause they man is locked up but still laced you?
And you know I need it twice, so it takes two
Fendi cross-body, fanny pack beige blue) 
Nigga

[Pusha T:]
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick but she charges

My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing upâ)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot like she D-ing up the spot (D-D)

// The Story Of Adidon //

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrocientos ochenta y ocho
The Spyder joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghost-writin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The Ms count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, "I'm on One"
Dennis Graham stay off the gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five, hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner, but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancÃ©e
Let 'em know who you chose as your BeyoncÃ©
Sophie knows better, ask your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat motherfucker, playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a porn star, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches
Me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80, tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga, six, six, six
Surgical summer with it, snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

Surgical Summer, Volume 1
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Yeah, DAYTONA
Album of the motherfuckin' year
And you talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
Well I wanna see what it's like when you get angry, okay?
You show me that
Push!

// Tick, Tock //

[Pusha T:]
King Push
RZA
Razor
Execution

The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'til you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly; your traitor is your neighbor
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth; the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth, stillborn or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung, I'm the one

[Raekwon:]
Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shallah is ill
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica
With tuna salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rocking Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption

[Pusha T:]
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

[Joell Ortiz:]
God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Moving with lasers under Rugers
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work,' that's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
Second-hand swept across that pretty Breitling
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team

[Pusha T:]
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin

In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain 'cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, 'cause it's death before dishonor
Gone

[Danny Brown:]
Check! Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It's the microphone methadone, greatest ever etched in stone
You ain't getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I'm your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I'm a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
'Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest, let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It don't matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway
