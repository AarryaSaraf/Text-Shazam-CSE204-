Album: FearOfGod2LetUsPray

// My God //

I can't be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
We don't mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
Started with Similac powder in a baby bottle
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I'll be damned
Gator at my momma's house, welcome to zombie land
A hustler's paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
'Cause the batter I add had the coca base
When you get to heaven's door they won't hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker's face
There's no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four-wheeling right
You know you're up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I'm a wizard at it, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic

Yes! My God!

The Second Coming is in the second verse
The first coming still here, so I'll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
They say I'm heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I'm a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
They'll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
It's the new god flow, ain't it
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted

Yes! My God!

// Feeling Myself //

[Kevin Cossom:]
I'm feeling myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost
'Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feeling myself

[Pusha T:]
Oh, what a feeling, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feeling myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

[Kevin Cossom:]
I'm feeling myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost
'Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feeling myself

[Pusha T:]
Baby take your chance, never mind what you're hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you're wearing
Shop 'til you drop they say sharing is caring
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

[Kevin Cossom:]
I'm feeling myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost
'Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feeling myself

[Pusha T:]
I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me Smoking Ace
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself

[Kevin Cossom:]
I'm feeling myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost
'Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm gon' ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about y'all, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feeling myself

// Raid //

[Pusha T:]
I'm only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it's everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of twenty-thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S, D-E-A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Combination locks to the kilo's that I hold
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any them top floors
35 large, took it right out the top drawer
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock drawer

[Pharrell:]
It's like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac, he'll die in a dream

[50 Cent:]
You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to taking them Os
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look, I'm all grown up and I done blown up
Nigga, ain't much changed; in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice, the Ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I'm filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin'
Red eyes, smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
50 back running 'round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire

[Pharrell:]
It's like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream, ugh!

[Pusha T:]
I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shitload of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep-sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price? Man, that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor; then, you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil-scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller
Bitches double-team when I have my sleepovers
Yuugh! Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
This is tailor-made, drug dealer theme music
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

[Pharrell:]
It's like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream

// Alone In Vegas //

I let you into my diary to admire me
The make-up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self-righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piÃ±ata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiÃ³s, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Lost some niggas, some other niggas double crossed 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back, I blew a small fortune
Wrestled with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Ric Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous (Woo!)
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid crane kickâno Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tightrope walking, tryna keep a level head
But bright lights blind, look at what the devil did

She left the door open, gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money, partied nights with the A-list
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas

They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911, you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista, I'm steppin' out the bleachers
How the tide turns when the pupil's now the teacher
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede ya, yuugh!
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era, I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it

She left the door open, gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money, partied nights with the A-list
I write this alone in Vegas
'Member nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading
So I write this alone in Vegas

Yeah, Fear of God niggas
Got me feelin' like Pac, this the realest shit I ever wrote
Who you know
Sit in New York for two days around Grammy winners
Come back home straight to the money getters?
'Bout fourteen thousand dollars worth of twenties
Brown paper bag money, yeah
I call that a good weekend, ha ha
Re-Up Gang forever
Long Live the Caine coming soon
Malice, my brother, I love you
Liva Don, 'til the end, nigga, yes
Emmanuel, hope I ain't get you in no trouble with that shit
That was a long time ago, you know? Ha ha
You know how we do
My nigga Nottz, is blacking out on this beat, my nigga
Yeah, come on, my nigga Watts, what up?
Young Young, what up, my nigga?
Talk that shit, my nigga
Hey 'Ye, is you ready?
Is you ready my nigga? I had to get this of my chest
Is you ready now though? Let's go then
G.O.O.D. Music, yes

// Changing Of The Guards //

[Diddy:]
Yeah, ugh
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Louder
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
These niggas' heads is too light (Yah)
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Take that (Yes)
Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha
Get 'em!

[Pusha T:]
It's like the changin' of the guards
We changin' out the frauds
I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz
Long time comin', Sam Cookin' up these bars
Still Eddy Caning, see the fiends sunk in jaws (Yiuuck)
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar (yes)
I'm Buddy Lee, so lucky me, see I'm home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Woo)
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home (yes)
So as I embark, this where begin start
I write my own happy endin', nigga pen sharp
My life's a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse's daybed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch from out the rain forest
So many bitches it's a blur, I take the blame for it (Woo)
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify
As I uplift this art form ceilin' high
I can't identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath
Outsiders lookin' in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single-handedly carried me (It's just my life)
Escaped clever through the foxhole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me (Never)
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said (Welcome home, baby)
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots goin' off that'll awake the dead
Push!

// Amen //

[Shawty Redd:]
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen

Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Yo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)

[Kanye West:]
You like that, don't ya? I wrote it myself, by the way
And I don't mean to be selfish, but I picture myself gettin' paid
And you might catch pneumonia, 'cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it, now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I'm tryin' to get paid

[Pusha T:]
Tryna get saved? (Too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stockin' mask, niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I'ma let all y'all niggas pray for it, my young niggas knockin' off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end, only fuckin' way I'ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on, my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep tellin' me to go hard, number one spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more, front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red, "Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin' in my lane for, not knowin' that it's a landmine?
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze, throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood, solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers, I'ma flood, black Jesus piece like it's dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine, rollerball spikes, I'm PokÃ©mon
Paris shit, Louboutin, under bright lights, where do you belong?

[Shawty Redd:]
Please Lord, yeah, it's gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin', niggas starvin', ay, 'cause they can't find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Kanye West:]
Amen, how many people do you know hatin'
On your downfall, sittin' there, waitin'?
When you shine, I don't know what they gon' say then
Everything I do now stadiums
So tell me what they really gon' say to him
And I'm headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil's pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God's child
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
I need the ice, I need the lights, uh
In Egypt they fightin' for freedom
Cop pull you over, no reason, beat 'em

[Shawty Redd:]
Please Lord, yeah, it's gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin', niggas starvin', ay, 'cause they can't find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

[Young Jeezy:]
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Saleen, yeah that's a Mustang
Break 'em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin'
They say they want that dumb shit, well, this is ignorant
Condo on the timepiece, yeah, now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I'm on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who's pickin' up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraordinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can't even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it 'cause I lived it' man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, "Don't you fuck with me"

[Shawty Redd:]
Please Lord, yeah, it's gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin', niggas starvin', ay, 'cause they can't find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen

// Trouble On My Mind //

[Pusha T:]
It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle (Yeah)

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
'Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Let's hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit

[Pusha T:]
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

[Tyler, The Creator:]
I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the

[Pusha T:]
With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me

Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind

// What Dreams Are Made Of //

[Ric Flair:]
"It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You're talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! Wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!"

To all hustlas with the same interest
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I'm what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that's Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on 'em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I'm still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards

You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of

// Body Work //

[French Montana:]
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound, you know we not backin' down
Hundred drum like, "Hold that doe", diamonds flash like Kodak though
Straight cash, nigga, fuck that loan, seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch, I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder, Petey Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch, Hurricane Irene

[Juicy J:]
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three Ks and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It's eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three Ks and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It's eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')

// Everything That Glitters //

[Pusha T:]
Ayo French
You, you know I'm 'bout that life right?
Pusha!

[French Montana:]
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

[Pusha T:]
For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every known rat, it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and a tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer

[French Montana:]
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

[Pusha T:]
I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they're clappin' their chrome
Took a brick and I turned it to stone
5 into 10, the Return of the Clones
Then I took my experience and turned it to poems
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed
Few still reminiscin' in their CL
Selling Pete Rock, cruisin' in their V-12

[French Montana:]
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
'Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by

// So Obvious //

[Bangladesh:]
I see you supplying the strip
I'm supplyin' the hits
These niggas been fiendin' for this shit
Push!

In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares (Hah)
Let the gods of the game know I'm right here (Bangladesh)
To you new motherfuckers, Buzz Lightyear
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope (Yeah)
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote (What?)
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folks (Ha ha)
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes (Uh huh)
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax (Who run it?)
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em (Wake up, niggas)
Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em (Blap)
I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'? (ha ha ha)

I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Yeah)
I just wanna flip it (Yeah)
I just wanna sell it (Yeah)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it

Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it (My jeans is heavy)
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it (Forty racks in my pocket)
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it (We scatter big boy rise, nigga)
Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it
Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it (Tell your bitch to come in)
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
As I burn through this money, no thought to it (What you lookin' at?)
80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it
I just shop through it; cook and chop to it
Move Heavy D (Dope boy shit); I should wop to it
We got our own thing; drop the top to it (Woo)
This is block music; Waka Flock to it (Push)

I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it (Yeah)
I just wanna flip it (Flip it)
I just wanna sell it (Sell it)
I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it

I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw (We supply the block)
Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In that two-door, no rims on the car
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
See what I saw, the best gettin' better (Dope man, dope man)
Look, but can't touch; I'm a motherfuckin' leper
Q-dog stepper, Stomp The Yard better
K-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter
Oh, there it is; let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever (Yeah)

I just wanna flip it (Push)
I just wanna sell it
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Yeah)
I just wanna sell it (What?)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it

[Bangladesh:]
Push, you need a hit, nigga, come see me
Bangladesh
Dope man, dope man
Pusha T
Got it for cheap

// I Still Wanna //

[Pusha T:]
It's like an itch you can't scratch
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still wanna

Sleeping with the finest, the thread count is bindless
Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus
In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in
The Roc's silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Sparkles to the table, got him feeling like he's Merlin
Whirlwind, powder makes your world spin
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Yeah, talk money, shit, I'm made of that
Cocaine parties like the 70s, I cater that
You know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is
You know what pain is?
Flushing two bricks and trying to have a nigga strain it out the drainage

See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish-scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

[Rick Ross:]
Grew up watching mamma car repo'd
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope where real nigga sell yay'
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Showing more love to bitches fucked on the side
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work

[Pusha T:]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fish-scale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos

[Ab-Liva:]
Testarossa top models, G4s
Gucci pass the crease off, everything I climb in, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe, push poison like a copperhead
Powder falls, smoke clears through the walking dead
The RosÃ© bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win, celebration spills
Through the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my ambiance
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Thousand ki's that I'm about to do Pilates on
Wear the king's crown like the grill a Maserati's on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, on a stripper
Blew a fuse and caught a body on, cocaine storaging
Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans is pouring in

[Pusha T:]
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen begging for the Rico

I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
