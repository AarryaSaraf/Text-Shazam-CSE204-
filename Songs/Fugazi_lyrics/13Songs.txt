// Waiting Room //

I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait
My time is water down a drain

Everybody's moving
Everybody's moving
Everything is moving,
Moving, moving, moving

Please don't leave me to remain
In the waiting room

I don't want the news
(I cannot use it)
I don't want the news
(I won't live by it)

Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
(Tell me why)

Because they can't get up
(Ahhh... Come on and get up)
(Come on and get up)

But I won't sit idly by
(Ahhh...)
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight
For what I want to be

And I won't make the same mistakes
(Because I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes
(And function)
Function is the key
Inside the waiting room

I don't want the news
(I cannot use it)
I don't want the news
(I won't live by it)

Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
(Tell me why)

Because they can't get up
(Ahhh... Come on and get up)
Up from the waiting room

Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)

(Tell me why)
Because they can't get up

// Bulldog Front //

Ahistorical -
you think this shit just dropped right out of the sky
My analysis:
it's time to harvest the crust from your eyes
To surge and refine, 
to rage and define ourselves 
against your line
So sorry friend, you must resign

You want to figure it out
we'll throw down, we'll throw down, we'll throw down
You want to figure it out 
well throw down your bulldog front

Bold bold mouth talking not so bold 
now that you've eaten your own
Lips flecked, mouth specked 
you strip the skin right off of the bone
But I would never say 
you act without precision or care, but
it's all attention to armor, 
to the armor you wear so well 

You want to figure it out
we'll throw down, we'll throw down
You want to figure it out 
we'll throw down your bulldog front

You want to figure it out
You want to figure it out

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home

You want to figure it out
we'll throw down and we'll throw down
You want to figure it out 
we'll throw down your bulldog front

You want to figure it out
You want to figure it out

// Bad Mouth //

You can't be what you were
So you better start being 
just what you are
You can't be what you were
the time is now is running out 
is running out 
is running running running out
You can't be what you were
So you better start living the life
That you're talking about
You can't be what you were

The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind

You're always talking talking talking talking talking shit now
but you will talk yourself down
you're going way down!

// Burning //

There's something acting on this body
Something goes in when nothing comes out
And someone's acting on this information
But nothing's registered from this location
From this site that I sense that I am, in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
I wanted a language of my own
My lips were sucked empty and I mouthed the lines
Of this crowd that surrounds me
Punctured and parceled I fold my hand
To this site that I sense that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?

// Give Me The Cure //

I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
That will never be found - like a reason
Good god I don't need a reason
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
But you've got to...
Give me the shot
Give me the pill
Give me the cure
Now what you've done to my world

// Suggestion //

Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body the only trait in the eye's of men?
I've got some skin
You want to look in
There lays no reward in what you discover
You spent yourself watching me suffer
Suffer you words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation of what it is to be a man
I've got some skin
You want to look in
She does nothing to deserve it
He only wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us
He just wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us
She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
But we are all guilty

// Glue Man //

I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes up, the tide rolls out
The trucks roll by the park still a park
Where children play and pick up stones
Anything to make them feel less alone - he's alone
His mind is his own town where all his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down
I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes down, the tide rolls back
We crawl our way back to the house we call home
He holds his home in the palm of his hand
And he says, and he says
You are my everyone, you are my anyone
You are my anytime, you are my every time y
You are my everywhere...anywhere...

// Margin Walker //

You make yourself so beautiful,
You make yourself so, so beautiful
And now I feel like I'm going,
I'm going to set myself on fire.
I'm going to set myself up at a window,
This margin walker wants a clear view,
This margin walker wants a clear shot,
and now I'm shooting it right on you.
Untraceable, untranslatable,
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle sends it right through you.
You make yourself so visible,
You make yourself so, so visible,
And now I feel like I'm in the tread of
some bastard jealousy.
Up here, above the avenue, up here, where
the things you do,
They lend me a problem with the language,
split my seams and then they drop in a fuse.

// And The Same //

Yes I know this is politically correct
But it comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
That is if you believe in race
And that you were born in the right time or place
That is a thought about face your way of thinking
Your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found out a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction.
If you have to carry a gun
To keep your fragile seat at number one
This is a bullet you can't outrun...
Your way of thinking
So wait and see it's coming round
Conscripted through the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound...
Your way of thinking your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction
Action. Reaction. Action. Reaction.

// Burning Too //

Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
We are consumed by society
We are obsessed with variety
We are all filled with anxiety that this world would not survive
We gotta put it out the sky is burning
We gotta put it out the water's burning
We gotta put it out the earth is burning
Outrage but then they say...
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
The world is not our facility
We have a responsibility
To use our abilities to keep this place alive
Right here right now
Do it. Now. Do it.

// Provisional //

Somewhere in these private minds,
The last one comes just in time to clear out
The chambers and sew up the lips,
'Cause that's the price to pay for hoping every slips not a slide.
In other words not to get it wrong,
It's pointless to walk when it's past time to run.
Secured under the weight of watchful eyes,
Lulled to sleep under clear expansive skies.
Somewhere in these prying hearts
Conflicting histories tear us apart
And we hope we don't get what we deserve,
Hide behind the targets in front of all the people we serve.

// Lockdown //

Blood on the pedals, blood on the grips
Steel leveled, chest level smear
My lips let them slip into a
Smile because now after
awhile it's all we're seen to do.
'Cause the business is as business does
Trash is trash until it's sealed from above
and left on to the corner of your mind to disappear.
Lockdown the remains.
Machine works best when the machine's not shy,
Trash is trash but trash from cash must divide.
Body bent body doubled, dismissed by time
A 5 to 9 will serve the 9 to 5.
Lockdown the remains.

// Promises //

Words
Words and expressions
All these confessions
Of where we stand
How I see you
And you see me
Dedications of symmetry
Together we will be
forever.
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see it through
Stupid fucking words
They tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
There were no truer words than when spoken
Let that stand as it should
There was nothing left when broken
We grab anything when we fall
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see us through
Stupid fucking words
They tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
You will do what you do
I will do what I do
We will do what we do
Rearrange and see it through
Go where you think you want to go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night
Promises.
Words.
