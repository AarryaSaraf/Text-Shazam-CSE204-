// Break //

Can't ask for more so why unfulfilled
We take apart everything we build
Had it right here but now it's gone
On and on
Break

// Place Position //

All origins are accidental
You've got no papers and no roads lead home
Anymore
Chance is the root of all place position
All maps are random all scales are wrong
Legal illegal no passion for the difference
Legal illegal false premise forge the nation
May all your borders be porous
Free transmission smear genetics
C'est la vie yawn yawn yawn
I can't stifle my boredom
So why not act your age
Fear of contagion the violence of a fence builder's dream
That masks the phrasing of "all the pleasures of home"
Legal illegal
I want to go home

// Recap Modotti //

Recap in taxi
No clothes no food
Take care of the children
We'll send for you soon
Alien you find you feel at home everywhere
You'll get by with so much less than anyone
Decieved entrapment through belief
Disclosure would decree
Accusations would be shed
Instead we stand over the dead
The vultures all well fed
Killer running free
Outside the window
The passing night sky fills with people I know
Taking me home

// No Surprise //

Hey what's your name?
Do you feel the same way too?
Siphon fuel don't make a sound
And most of all don't let me down
It comes as no surprise
We're destabilized
Lock eyes shared plan
No c.i.a. could understand
Defile define critique and salve
No c.i.a. no n.s.a.
No satellite could map our veins

// Five Corporations //

Moves so slowly
Grows so smoothly
Takes so neatly
It's as if they belong and they've been here all along
Grows so smoothly
Moves so slowly
Takes completely
It's as if they belong and they've been here all along
This one's ours let's take another
Check the math here check in ten years
Clusterfuck theory buy them up and shut them down
Then repeat in every town
Every town will be the same
This one's ours let's take another
Five corporations there is a pattern

// Caustic Acrostic //

Lights out for the cynical sharps
For their wide-eyed foils and all attendant props
Supporters of flash and pan-fried fucks
Who grease like cops throwing round their weight
And I feel dangerous and vexed
Swinging two ton second guess
And every motion just cuts too cruel too cruel
And the implication is that you're implicated
Like a caustic acrostic spelling out your name
Lights out cos I can see in the dark
Sidewind my way to the mark of fuse lines
Gas-wet for a spark
I crash I burn I've fully lost it anyway
And you're nowhere
Lights out loser

// Closed Captioned //

Your etiquette
Your rules on interaction
What are you waiting for?
Nobody's home we're all out trying to find one
What are we waiting for?
The recipe a clear connection the time the time the time the time
The direction we just want we don't know
This one wants the art this one wants the politic
Everybody wants their own damn station
If we're so fine maybe you can tell me why
no one counts until they're dead
I asked you, I asked you a question,
I just want I don't know
The imperfections are here to find if your position is so unkind
Everything is not alright
And since we live in present tense the only hope of making sense
All depends on the source of light
Everything is closed captioned so come one

// Floating Boy //

The sun came up
The sun came out
The sun did us in
The sun came out and tore us up
It ripped the shit out of our behinds
We drove home on towels off the heat of the seats
With sand in our teeth alright
Down on the ocean down on the sea
Water and wave under me
We're not brave but we're down for
the count alright

// Foreman's Dog //

Here's an all new version
Teeming with distractions
Trojan horse rolled backwards
Mastered buy your own device
Then splice in then cut to the sad sorry image of some grinning 'caster
Staring at a sinkhole
Piling up disasters
Making the footage raw
Now parade the muscles
Trying to make their dicks grow
Warring with their bodies dimensions oversold
"I wonder if I pierce it will my body stop lying to me?
Now mouthing mile a minute
Blasting like a furnace
Fogging up the lenses with the dampness of spew
Loss of concentration
Loss of obvious
Laws of stimulation
Signed anonymous
It's a stock set up
Man check it out!
A well worn cop's shoe's kicking out a door frame
Classwar extra
Pr-ing like a foreman's dog
"What a slob but I guess you know
He's got to make a living somehow"
Tossing a wild eyed greaser right onto the pavement
Scanned into the bright light maxing the pixels to glow
How did it come to mean nothing but this?

// Guilford Fall //

Down at the station
We question our rations
Wut you seem satisfied with the little recieved
Fractured appetite with bismuth pink on tap
Ascetic limbs gone tight and your lips are clamped and grey
Crash your appetite erasing every mark you make
Standing in the corner while you're working up your mantra
'derail the train the train the train derail the train'
Take the time to hesitate
While what's glistening on your plate
Goes dry and cold and not in your mouth
Alright you see your programmatic mind surrenders appetite
And you crash yourself all over the place
Snake ingest 40 times their body weight
But you you emaciate
You crash your shit all over the place now
Open your mouth!

// Pink Frosty //

Animosities and apologies
Back and forth we struggle,
Falter, refrain with glue and string and deciphering
We try, try, try to stay together
Despite the pain it's not our first time through nor our
Waterloo back and forth from situation
We move to episode
But if we can find some piece of mind
Intertwined the delivery is worth the load

// F/D //

Son of a gun and knife and bomb
Son of a bitch earned every stitch
Son of a father's son yes I know I'm one
Now it's time to pull the switch

Touch with your eyes drool with my eyes
Touch with your mind drool with my mind
Touch with your eyes drool with my eyes
Touch with my mind drool with your eyes
Pornsmanship and sales filtrate
Shoulder blades and things concave
And every smile that marks a lie
Passed in code is real desire
Dressed in silk and flavored milk
Bred in bone and finely honed
To always sell what we can't own
