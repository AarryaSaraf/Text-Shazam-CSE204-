// Baby's Arms //

There's been but one true love
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
And I got the hands to hold on to them

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Hide in my baby's arms
'Cause except for her you know
As I've implied

I would never, ever, ever be alone
'Cause it's all in my baby's hands
Shining, shining secret stones
In my baby's hands, in my baby's hands

I get sick of just about everyone
And I hide in my baby's arms
Shrink myself just like a Tom Thumb
I hide in my baby's hands
Hide in my baby's hand

'Cause except for her
There's just nothing to latch on to
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There's been but one true love
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
In my baby's arms, in my baby's arms
My baby's arms, in my baby's arms

Oh yeah, oh yeah, my baby's arms

// Jesus Fever //

I packed my suitcase with myself
But I'm already gone
I cleanse myself with vitamin health
But I'm already gone

I saw a rising though the river rising
And I saw it fall
The Jesus fever is falling all over you
Believers and lovers

But Jesus fever's fallin' all over
You believers and lovers

In a black bowl, I found a broken skull
Now I'm already gone
You can write my whole life down in a little book
When I'm already gone

I started shakin' and my heart breaking
And my belly crawls
The Jesus fever is falling all over you
Believers and lovers

When I'm a ghost, I see no reason to run
When I'm already gone
If it wasn't taped, you could escape this song
But I'm already gone

// Puppet To The Man //

Well I think by now you probably think I am a puppet to the man
Well, I'll tell you right now you best believe that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck in and I think I can unglue it
Sometimes I'm stuck in and I think I can unglue it

This one goes out to all those who want to rap to survive
Enough comes by saying, looting, I want 'em to die
My sister's stuck and she don't think she can unglue it
Sometimes I get stuck in a rut too, it's okay girlfriends
Sometimes I been rough so much I want it to end

Well I think by now you probably think I am a puppet to the man
But I shout it out loud because I now that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck in and I think I can unglue it
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?

Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it, will you help me do it?

// On Tour //

On tour, lord of the flies
Aw, hey, who cares? What's a guitar?
Watch out for this one
He'll stab you in the back for fun

I'm just playin', I know you, man
Most of the time

Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full of air
For turnin' your head wrong, I wouldn't know
I see through everyone, even my own self now

I wanna write my whole life down
Burn it there to the ground
I wanna sing at, top of my lungs
For fun, screamin' annoyingly
'Cause that's just me bein' me, bein' free

Watch out for this one
He'll pump you full of air
For turnin' your head wrong, I wouldn't know
'Cause I can see through him and them

On tour, lord of the flies, I'm just playin'
I got it made, most of the time

I wanna beat on a drum so hard
'Til it bleeds blood
Pull out the heart
'Til it don't start again, yeah

// Society Is My Friend //

Society is my friend
He makes me laugh in a cool blood bay
Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cool blood bay

Oh, society
Oh, yeah

Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cold blood bay, yeah
He stole my lady's hand
Hey how you doin' this kids
My hand is not for you to hold
So kiss me with your mouth without closing it all that much

Society is all around
Are you the beautiful sound of all the half  pip-squeal
Ecstatic brilliance at it's finest, that's my friend
Society is all around
It takes me down

Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down in a cold blood bay, yeah
Society is my friend
He makes me laugh down, down

// Runner Ups //

Hey old man, how many times we gotta tell you
We don't want a number, where you been so long?
Hey girl, come on over
That'll be just fine

If it ain't workin', take a whiz on the world
An entire nation drinkin' from a dirty truck
My best friend's long gone
But I got runner ups, yeah

When I walk in, my head is practically dragging
Yeah, and all I ever see is just a whole lot of dirt
My whole life's been one long running gag
Two packs of red apples for the long ride home

Well you know, baby

See you walking till you took a wrong way train
Then you sat down and couldn't get up

My best friend's long gone
But I got runner ups

I don't know if it's real but it's how I feel
Don't if you really came but I feel dumb in asking
You should have been an actor, she's so domineering
Take two eyed gold earrings for your troubles, man

Visibly dark points of future in a faze
Instead of standing, I'm running around
The sharpest tool in school doesn't know what's up

My best friend's long gone
But I got runner ups, yeah

// In My Time //

In my day I was young and crazy
Sure I didn't know shit, but now I'm lazy
One day I won't even know what was better
Then again and now I want much of nothing anyway

Two of us, one on each shoulder, I'm tryin' to turn
We're pullin' over, on this shoulder, ain't driving
I know when I get older, I'm dyin'
Well, I got everything I need and now
And it's fine now, it's fine now, it's fine

In my time I was whack and wild
I was just being myself then
But then I sat there just tryin' on faces
Wanna erase how discreet disgrace is

Pulling over on the shoulder, ain't driving
Put two of us, one on each shoulder, I'm tryin' to turn
I know when we get older, I'm dyin'
Well, I got everything I need and now
And it's fine now, it's fine now, it's fine

// Peeping Tomboy //

I wanna change but I don't wanna stay the same
I wanna go but I'm running
I wanna work but I don't wanna sit around
All day frowning

I wanna give up but I kinda wanna lie down
But not sleep, just rest
Give me a break, how much does it really take
Get my head out of here

I've been searching, I don't know what for
I came across some girl, she was a tomboy
And I was a peeping tom on that scene
I was a peeping Tom, you know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I wanna go but it's a one-way street with me
So I've been told and I'm goin'
When I'm down, I would never come around
But you should be kind and read my mind

I've been searching, I don't know what for
She was a tomboy and I admired her
'Cause I was a peeping Tom on that scene
I was a peeping tom, you know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I wanna change but I don't wanna stay the same
I wanna go but I'm running
I wanna work but I don't wanna sit around
All day frowning

// Smoke Ring For My Halo //

Smoke ring for my halo
Angel, demon, human
Oh, the rest have made it
Over and over

Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now

Smoke ring for my halo
Human, angel, demon
Hundreds have made it
Right under the roof of your house

Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then, yeah

Sippin' from the soda can
Exercises mind
Pacifies the land
Makes a move steady, a jilted man

I feel like layin' down
I feel like layin' down
Yeah, and I wanna do it again
Oh, what a mess I guess I'm in

// Ghost Town //

In the mornin', I'm not done sleepin'
In the evening, I guess I'm alive
It's alright, can still peel myself off sleepwalking
In a ghost town

Think I'll never leave my couch again
'Cause when I'm out, I'm only on my mind
And then again I guess it ain't always that way

In the mornin' I'm not done sleepin'
In the evening I guess I'm alive
It's alright, could still peel myself off sleepwalking
In a ghost town

Think I'll never leave my couch again
'Cause when I'm out, I'm only on my mind

Christ was born, I was there
You know me, I'm a ram
I got friends, well, wait where was I?
Well, I am tryin'

When I'm drivin'
I find on dreamin', dreamin' two's and drifting
It's just these towns, I wanna pull over, open up and stay
And rain drops might fall on my hair sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind

Christ was here, you just missed Him
Now I'm out, goin' down second
To all the stores to see my friend
If I can't survive oceans

When I'm drinkin' I get to joke and
And I'm laughing, falling down
But that's just fine and I just pick myself up
And walk down ghost town

Rain drops might fall on my hair sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind
Then again I guess it ain't always that way
