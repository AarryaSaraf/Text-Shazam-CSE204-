// The Ballad Of Red Buckets //

I wonder what's on your mind
I wonder what's on your mind
Look around and see
What it does to me
I wonder what's on your mind

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it'll surely come
And it'll surely come
Here it comes again

Think I'll throw it all away
Think I'll throw it all away
If words come back to me
Pretend that I don't see
I'll just cover my eyes and stare

And it will surely come
It will surely come
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again

// Deeper Into Movies //

Late at night, gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world till I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
I've been sending signals tune to outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes

Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can hear it as I open my eyes
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - and it blows my mind

Like a finger in the sky... [repeat]
