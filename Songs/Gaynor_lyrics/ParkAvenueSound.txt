// This Love Affair //

(Check it out, check it out, this love affair)
(Check it out, check it out, this love affair)

One - it's on the money, two - it's in full stride
Three - we've got each other, so there's no need to hide
Honey, this love affair has gotten to where I want it
This love affair, I'm so proud to own it
Oh this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
Four -  we're getting over, five -  we've got it made
Six, let's pray forever, this love will never fade
âCause it's a miracle there ain't no doubt about it
This love affair, I've got to talk about it
Oh this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
For the first time in my life I can see clear the skies
So let's soar them like two eagles and fly so high
Seven - bound for heaven, eight - we're at the gate
Nine - we've got their blessings, ten - we're perfect mates
Honey, this love affair has gotten me where I want it
This love affair, I'm so proud to own it
Yeah yeah 

Yeah yeah...

This love affair, Oh oh
Seven - bound for heaven, oh well eight - we're at the gate
Nine - we've got their blessings, ten - we're perfect mates
Honey this love affair is in the right direction
This love affair is under love's protection
Woah this love affair
This love affair...

// You're All I Need To Get By //

When I was just a little girl
I wanted the world at my feet
Now all that's changed
Cause I have loved and
Now I do concede
(You're all I need to get by)
(You're all I need to get by)
Like the sweet morning dew
I took one look at you,
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With my arms open wide
I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead
Always there in time of need
And when you lose your will
I'll be there to push you up the hill
There's no
No looking back for us
We got love sure enough
That's enough
You're all
You're all I need to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest
For you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree
Dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found
Strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store
But together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you
And inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a woman
Out of a soul that didn't have a goal
Cause we, we got the right foundation
And with love and determination
You're all, You're All I need to get by.
You're all I want to strive for and do a little more
All the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
All I need to get by...
All I need is you...
