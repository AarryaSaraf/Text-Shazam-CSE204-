// Amazing Grace //

There was a time when I was broken
Didn't know which way to turn
I was paralyzed, wondering why
Hanging on to hope, [?]
My faith was failing me

But I heard a voice deep down inside
Saying, "Isnpite of the mess that you made
Don't you know I suffered so you wouldn't have to"
That's when I dropped to my knees and I prayed

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
[?]

Right then, right there in that moment (lovestruck)
Lovestruck my soul to the core (whoa)
And like blood through my veins
It rushed in and saved me
That's why I'm so thankful for

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
[?]
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now
I see

When we've been with Him
For ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We'll have no [?]
Just sing God's praise
And [?]

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
[?]
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now
I see

I was lost
I was [?]
I was down
I was out
I was sad
I was lost
I was sad
Feeling down
Now I know
Who He is
And I know
He can take me all through
Whatever life brings my way

He hasn't failed me
He's never failed me
I wanna tell ya
If you're a Godly person
He's your Savior
He helped
Through all my trials
Through all tribulations
He showed me
How to get through
All the bad times in my life

// Back On Top //

I can't hear you

I had a front row seat on a roller coaster ride, you got that right
I kept on hoping things would change but I finally realized the devil's a liar, huh
With every twist and turn, every bridge that he burned
He brought me down, down, down
But heaven picked me up on the drop

Now I'm back on top
Like I never fell off
I took some knock down punches, but I'm still standing strong
Back in the groove, got a whole new view
Just when it looked like it was certain, the hurtin' would never stop
I'm back on top
Yeah, I'm back on top

He had me right where he wanted
Kept me in the dark, shutting down my heart
Thought I would never see the light of day from under that rock, then I heard that knock
It was Jesus, sweet Jesus
Yeah, he took my hand, picked me up, put that devil right on the spot

Now I'm back on top
Like I never fell off
I took some knock down punches
But I'm still standing strong
Back in the groove, got a whole new view
Just when it looked like it was certain
The hurtin' would never stop
I'm back on top
Yeah, I'm back on top

Keep praying when you can't get up
Have faith when the going gets rough
Yeah, you gotta keep on running
Soon you gonna reach that summit
Keep praying when you can't get up
Have faith when the going gets rough
Yeah, you gotta keep on running
Soon you gonna reach that summit

With every twist and turn, every bridge that you burn
You brought me down, down, down
But heaven picked me up on the drop

Now I'm back on top
Like I never fell off
I took some knock down punches, but I'm still standing strong
Back in the groove, got a whole new view
Just when it looked like it was certain the hurtin' would never stop
I'm back on top
Yeah, back on top

Back on top
Yeah

// He Won't Let Go //

You may be down and feeling low
Tossed by the wind, wherever it may blow
You're just confused and filled with doubt
Lost in the dark, and you can't see no way out

There is a mountain for you to run to
Where there's a rock that will shelter you
There is a man, that you should know
Stretch out His hand to pull you close

And if you'll hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go

There is a voice, you should listen to
There is a choice for what you ought to do
The only step that you need to take
To the side and let Him lead the way

He knows your heart, and He feels your pain
He knows your scars, every one by name
He knows your flaws and he knows your fears
He'll bring you joy to replace your tears

And if you'll hold on
He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go

Take a look at me, I'm living proof
Trust and believe, He'll do the same for you
It's nothing we can earn, it just takes a little faith
It's nothing we deserve, it's just His amazing grace

And if you'll hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go

He won't let go
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, He won't let go...
Just put your hand in the hand, in the hand of the Man with the master plan
And He won't let go, He won't let go
He won't let go...

// Joy Comes In The Morning //

Forecast says rain
And the pain that go with it
That we can't change
And we all get caught up in it
Mind filled with stress
And your heart won't stop racing
Can't find no rest
And you're back and forth pacing

Don't you know it's darkest
Before the dawn
So just have faith in the sun

Joy comes in the morning
If you'll just be still
Joy comes in the morning
No matter how bad it feels
Right after the storm hits
And I promise it will
Joy comes in the morning

Let in a little light
And it'll help you see
Surely the truth
Gonna set you free
Put it all on the table
You'll see things differently
God is able
Lay your troubles at his feet

And it's darkest
Before the dawn
So just have faith in the sun

Joy comes in the morning
If you'll just be still
Joy comes in the morning
No matter how bad it feels
Right after the storm hits
And I promise it will
Joy comes in the morning

There ain't no need for worryin'
(Wait on Him, wait on Him)
And there ain't no way to hurryin'
(Wait on Him, wait on Him)
'Cause somewhere in the Word He says
(Wait on Him, wait on Him)
Won't be long, won't be long

Joy comes in the morning, yeah
Right after the storm hits
(Right after, right after the storm)
Joy comes in the morning
Morning (joy comes in the morning)
Morning (joy comes in the morning)

// Only You Can Do //

I've had my fortune, had my share of fame
Been around the world, I guess I've played the game
Put my attention into everything but You, mm-mm
It's taken me this long to understand
It's taken being broken time and again
To realize that all I really need is You, only You

When all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart and You won't let go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
Like only You can do, Jesus

Every time I try to do it all alone
Every time I try to make it on my own
That's when I realize no matter what I try to do
I still need You

And when all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart, You won't let me go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
Like only You can do, Jesus

Only You can turn my night into day
Break through the prison walls and rescue me
No one else can change a heart the way You do
Only You, yes You

When all hope is gone, when it's out of my reach
I will hold on, I will believe
That You've got my heart, You won't let me go
I feel You liftin' the weight off of my soul

Like only You can do, yeah
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do, ooh, oh
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do, ooh, yeah
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You can turn my night into day
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You, only You can take the pain away
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Only You
(Only You can do, only You can do)
Like only You can do
(Only You can do, only You can do)
(Only You can do, only You can do)

// Singin' Over Me //

You tell me that you feel so broken
Tell me that you're all used up
Looking for a little salvation
Just a drop in a empty cup
Mm, I remember that song
Used to be the soundtrack of my life
But God's giving me a whole new melody
Telling me it's going to be alright

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
And when I just can't see at all
He's still singing over me
I sing cause I'm forgiven (Oh, yeah)
I sing cause I'm redeemed (Redeemed)
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing over me (Yes, he is)
Singing over me (Over me), singing over me

I used to think that everything was hopeless
Used to think that I was on my own
'Til the God of all creation
Made my heart his home, and now I sing

I sing because I'm happy (Yeah)
I sing because I'm free (Oh, I'm free)
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing over me
I sing 'cause I'm forgiven
I sing 'cause I'm redeemed
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing

(Ain't no sorrow), ain't no sorrow (No, no)
(Ain't no sin) Ain't no sin
There's no broken that he can't mend (I like this)
(Ain't no worry) I'm telling you, ain't no worry (No worry)
(Ain't no shame) Ain't no shame (No shame)
There's no condemnation in his name

So I sing because I'm happy (Oh, yeah)
And I sing because I'm free
So won't' you sing with me? (Yeah)
I sing because I'm happy (I'm happy)
I sing because I'm free (Oh, I'm free)
And when I just can't sing at all (Yeah)
He's still singing over me (Oh, oh)
I sing because I'm forgiven (Forgiven)
I sing cause I'm redeemed (I'm redeemed)
And when I just can't sing at all (Yeah)
He's still singing over me (Over, yeah)
Singing over me (Over me), yeah, yeah
Singing over me (Over me now, yeah, yeah)
He's still singing over me (Oh, he's still singing)
Singing over me (Yeah, he's still singing)
Singing over me (Aw, yeah)
He's singing, he's singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mhm

// Man Of Peace //

Here we go, mm

Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch
The band is playing Dixie, a man's got his hand outstretched
Could be the Fuhrer, could be the local priest
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, he's got the sweet gift of gab, got a harmonious tongue
Knows every song of love that's ever been sung
Good intentions can be evil (Mhm), both hands can be full of grease, yeah (Yeah)
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, well first he's in the background (Yeah), then he's in the front

You better watch your step
Watch your step, watch your step
Sometimes Satan, comes as a man of peace, yeah, yeah

Could be standing next to you (Mhm)
The person that you notice least (Never notice)
Well, I hear that that sometimes Satan comes as a man, a man of peace

Well he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Somewhere mama's weepin' for her blue-eyed boy
And she's holding those little white shoes in that little broken toy
And she's following a star, yeah, the same one them three man followed from the east
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace (A man of peace)

// Day One //

I've got so many burdens on my heart
Questions weighing on my mind
I've grown so tired of all this madness
Wishin' I could leave it all behind
Even now, fear and doubt
Keep tryin' to drag me down, take me out
So hard to hear your voice in all this crazy noise

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, oh take me back to day one

All my hope should be found in You
Not the socials or the daily news
They don't have the truth I need
Only You can set me free, so...

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, Lord, take me back to day one

Back to love, joy, peace and happiness
Where you gave this wayward child a second chance
'Cause where my soul finds comfort, I find rest, oh oh

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, Lord, take me back
Take me back, oh take me back to day one
To day one
