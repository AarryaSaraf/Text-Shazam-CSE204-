// Stop! In The Name Of Love //

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love, you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you
(Think it over)
After I've been sweet to you

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid, I'll be losing you forever

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Baby, think it over
Think it over, baby

Ooh, think it over baby

// For You, My Love //

I do not sleep tonight
I may not ever
The sins of the past have come
See how they sit down together
Outside my window, outside my door
And I know the reason what they've all come here for
You my love, my sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of
Surrender is easy
I know you do me no harm
But your innocence haunts me
The most fatal of charms
Oh, I must have done some wrong
On a dark and distant day
For I know full and well tonight
This is how that I must pay
And you my love, my sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of
Oh, you my love, my sweet, sweet love
Are what it's all because of, yeah

// Even A Fool Would Let Go //

It's funny how love goes
'Cause I know this could never work out
But honey, how love grows
Even though there's no reason to doubt

This can never be
You keep saying, it's wrong
Neither one of us is free
Still I want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no

When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go?

Love has no reason
Like the words in a song that don't rhyme
My love has no season
I just know that it's there all the time

Maybe, just you and me
I can't believe that it's wrong
Thinking about you and me
Just makes me want to hold on

When even a fool would let go
'Cause he knows that there's no use in trying
Even a child would say no

When he knows that he'll end up crying
Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
Even a fool would let go?

Tell me now, is it wise holdin' you
When even a fool would let go?
