// 2000 Light Years Away //

I sit alone in my bedroom
Starin' at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speedin', my love is yearnin'

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!

I sit outside and watch the sunrise
Lookout as far as I can
I can't see her, but in the distance
I hear some laughter, we laugh together

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, so
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!

I sit alone in my bedroom
Starin' at the walls
I've been up all damn night long
My pulse is speedin', my love is yearnin'

I hold my breath and close my eyes and
Dream about her
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
She holds my malachite so tight, oh
Never let go
'Cause she's 2000 light-years away
Years away!

// One For The Razorbacks //

Juliet's trying
To find out what she wants, but she don't know
Experience has got her down
Well, look this direction
I know it's not perfection, it's just me
I want to bring you up again, now

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
Well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy, but I will try
To bring you up again, somehow

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

Juliet's crying
Well, now she's realizing love can be
Filled with pain and distrust
I know I am crazy
And a bit lazy, but I will try
To bring you up again, somehow

'Cause I'm losing what's left of my dignity
A small price I'll pay to see that you're happy
Forget all the disappointments you have faced
Open up your worried world and let me in

// Christie Road //

Staring out of my window
Watching the cars go rolling by
My friends are gone
I've got nothing to do
So I sit here patiently
Watching the clock tick so slowly
Gotta get away
Or my brains will explode

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

See the hills from afar
Standing on my beat up car
The sun went down
And the night fills the sky
Now I feel like me once again
As the train comes a-rollin' in
Smoked my boredom gone
Slapped my brains up so high

Give me something to do to kill some time
Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

Mother, stay out of my way
Of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way
To Christie Road
Mother, stay out of my way
Of that place we go
We'll always seem to find our way
To Christie Road

If there's one thing that I need
That makes me feel complete
So I go to Christie Road
It's home, it's home
It's home, it's home, it's home

// Private Ale //

Wander down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Well, I don't seem to care
I do notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Well I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, oh-oh-oh

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, oh yeah

// Dominated Love Slave //

I wanna be your dominated love slave
I wanna be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Smack me in the forehead with a chain

'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep (Come on!)

(Whoo!) Want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin (Woohoo!)
I wanna feel pain all over my body (Come on, now!)
Can't wait to be punished for my sins

'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

Come on!
Woohoo!
Hey, Bo!
Goin' again
Whoo!
My pickup truck

'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive... staples?!

// One Of My Lies //

When I was younger, I thought that the world circled around me
But in time, I realized I was so wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality, yeah

Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable and it's time you knew the truth

'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies

Why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever?
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you've been there once, well I hardly think so

Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable and it's time you knew the truth

'Cause it's just one of my lies!
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies

I used to pray at night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too... Why?

// 80 //

My mental stability reaches its bitter end
And all my senses are coming unglued
Is there any cure for this disease someone called love
Not as long as there are girls like you

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I wanna hurt myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against a wall

Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone
And lock myself up in a padded room
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air
'Cause no one wants to hear a drunken fool

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against a wall

I do not mind if this goes on
'Cause now it seems I'm too far gone
I must admit that I am enjoying myself
80, please keep taking me away, away

Everything she does questions my mental health
It makes me lose control
I just can't trust myself

If anyone can hear me slap some sense in me
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated
So I lose my head or I bang it up against a wall

// Android //

Hey old man in women's shoes, I
Wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams of
Wearing women's shoes and being crazy?

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old? Will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away

When the old man was in school
Did the golden rules make him go crazy?
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope? It's crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old? Will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away

And it seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on
My chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
And waste away

It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on
My chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
Waste away

// No One Knows //

Why should my fun have to end?
For me, it's only the beginning
See my friends begin to age
A short countdown to their end

Don't call me irresponsible
Don't call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again, 'cause no one knows

I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes, my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever?

Don't call me irresponsible
Don't call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again, 'cause no one knows

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
(Does it seem like all your memories fade?)
But when you think of me
(You soak up knowledge to fill the space)
Do you fill your head with schemes?
(Yet still, my answer remains; I don't know)
Better think again, 'cause no one knows
I don't

// Who Wrote Holden Caulfield? //

A thought burst in my head
And I need to tell you
It's news that I forethought
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
I think I just forgot

Well, it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying

There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

I shuffle through my mind
To see if I can find
The words I left behind
Was it just a dream
That happened long ago?
Oh well, never mind

Well it hasn't been the first time
And it sure does drive me mad
That's what I'm saying

There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

What I'm saying
There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

There's a boy who fogs his world, and now he's getting lazy
There's no motivation, and frustration makes him crazy
He makes a plan to take a stand, but always ends up sitting
Someone help him up, or he is gonna end up quitting

// Words I Might Have Ate //

Now it seems I can't keep my mind above you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds
The love I bitched about, I finally had found

But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me, I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

It was something real that I could've had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

Tell me what the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
The words I might have ate

But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Why? Why?
Why? Oh why?
Why? Why?

// Sweet Children //

Sweet young girl, so soft and blonde
Does exactly what she's been warned
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Believing all his faith through lies
Putting his hands onto her thighs
Impurity has now been gripped
He takes away her innocence

Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?

Ooh, Johnny Ray is running again
As he hits the floor again
Running from the light of day
Or maybe lie and celebrate
The slightest urge goes from his hand
Follow me if you understand
He's got the trigger of his gun
The final sin and now he runs

Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?

Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?

// Best Thing In Town //

Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

'Cause I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

I'm seeing faces
Of mysteries of the earth
I know not one
But the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance
Of solutions I can't find
A missing piece
Of a thought that's in my mind

Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

'Cause I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

I'm sick and growing tired of always playing this shit!

// Strangeland //

Looking at the clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of peace
Now I wonder where this place is from
The evidence is everywhere
I start to run, and now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you wanna be for sure?
I know my rights, I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head if you will find
Mother love from all mankind
You look above and then you shout
No other way to say your head is fine

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

// My Generation //

Well, people try to put us down
Talkin' bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' bout my generation
The things they do look awful cold
Talkin' bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Heineken, fuck that shit!

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation

My generation

Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
