// Welcome To Paradise //

Dear mother,
Can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise

Dear mother,
Can you hear me laughing?
It's been six whole months
Since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go

Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes
Some call it slums
Some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home
Welcome to paradise
Oh, paradise

// Burnout //

I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
Drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead

Oh, apathy has rained on me
And now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning, but I don't mind
I'll live inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
And hell, who needs them anyway?

I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead, dead

I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead
I'm not growing up, I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line to walk amongst the dead, dead

// Having A Blast //

Takin' all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind
I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

I'm losin' all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
A loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And all the shit you put me through

Well, no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times we've spent and what they've meant

To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothin'?

To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'
To me it's nothin'

// Chump //

I don't know you, but I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb

You're the cloud hanging out over my head
And hail comes crashing down, welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me

Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
I'm a chump!

// Longview //

I sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fucking lazy

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored I'm going blind
And I smell like shit

I got no motivation
Where is my motivation?
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration, huh!

I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will (We will!)
My mother says to get a job
But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking lonely

Bite my lip and close my eyes
Take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored
I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes
I'm tripping away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind
But it's just a myth

// Pulling Teeth //

I'm all busted up
Broken bones and nasty cuts
Accidents will happen
But this time I can't get up
She comes to check on me
Making sure I'm on my knees
After all she's the one
Who put me in this state

Is she ultra-violent?
Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killing me!!!

For now I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true

Is she ultra-violent?
Is she disturbed?
I better tell her that I love her
Before she does it all over again
Oh God, she's killing me!!!

Looking out my window for
Someone that's passing by
No one knows I'm locked in here
All I do is cry

For now I'll lie around
Hell, that's all I can really do
She takes good care of me
Just keep saying my love is true

// Basket Case //

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything
All at once
I am one of those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex
That's bringing me down
I went to a whore
He said "My life's a bore"
So quit my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Uh, yuh, yuh, ya

Grasping to control
So I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid?
Am I just stoned?

// She //

She...
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
That's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She...
She's figured out
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time
To smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world
That's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

Are you locked up in a world
That's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

// Sassafras Roots //

Roaming 'round your house, wasting your time
No obligation, just wasting your time
So why are you alone, wasting your time?
When you could be with me, wasting your time?

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothin' else to do
May I waste your time too?

Warding off regrets, wasting your time
Smoking cigarettes, wasting your time
I'm just a parasite wasting your time
Applying myself to wasting your time

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothin' else to do
May I waste your time too?

So why are you alone, wasting your time?
When you could be with me, wasting your time?

Well, I'm a waste like you
With nothing else to do
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?
May I waste your time too?

// When I Come Around //

I heard you crying loud,
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone,
And it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself

Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roaming for the moment
Sleazin' my back yard so don't get so uptight
You been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing
Was ever there

You can't go forcing something if it's just
Not right

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

No time to search the world around
Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around
When I come around

// Coming Clean //

Seventeen, and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a role of disillusion

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand

Secrets collecting dust, but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

Oh-oh-oh

Seventeen, and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

// Emenius Sleepus //

I saw my friend the other day
And I don't know exactly just what he became
It goes to show
It wasn't long ago
And I was just like you
And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home

How have I been? How have you been?
It's been so long
What have you done with all your time?
And what went wrong?

I knew you back when
And youâyou knew me
And now I think you're sick and I wanna go home

Anybody ever say "No"?
Ever tell you that you weren't right?
Where did all the little kid go?
Did you lose it in a hateful fight?
And you know it's true

It wasn't long ago
That I was just like you
And now I think I'm sick and I wanna go home

// In The End //

All brawn and no brains
And all those nice things
You finally got what you want
Someone to look good with
And light your cigarette
Is this what you really want?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So
I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around

How long will he last
Before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my
"Special friend" 'til the end?
And when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So
I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around

I figured out what you're all about
And I don't think I like what I see
So
I hope I won't be there in the end
If you come around

// F.O.D. //

Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
This time, I'm on to you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
Your head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say

Stuck down in a rut
Of dis-logic and smut
A side of you, well hid
When it's all said and done
It's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we torched two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say (to say)

You're just a fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching now to say
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you
So listen up, 'cause you might miss

You're just a fuck
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die
Good night

// All By Myself //

One, two, three

I was alone, I was all by myself
No one was looking, I was thinking of you
Oh yeah, did I mention I was all by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself

I went to your house, but no one was there
I went in your room
I was all by myself
You and me had
Such wonderful times
When I'm all by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
