// Nothin' But You //

Daddy used to tell me "Don't you drag your feet"
"Never seen a good intention that a man could eat"
Well, I got about a million things I need to do
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

I don't need no money, no fancy car
House up on the hill where all the rich folks are
Well, they can have the whiskey, keep the cocaine, too
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

// If You Need A Fool //

Darlin', I could tell we're through
That leavin' look's all over you
I'll be waitin' here no matter what you do
Call me if you need a fool

Go and find another guy
And if he don't believe your lies
You know there's someone who'll swear every word is true
Call me if you need a fool

They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to
They don't come back for more the way I always do
So if you ever change your mind
I'm not very hard to find
You can find me in the phone book under "Blue"
Call me if you need a fool

They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to
They don't come back for more the way I always do
So if you ever change your mind
I'm not very hard to find
You can find me in the phone book under "Blue"
Call me if you need a fool
Call me if you need a fool

Girl, it won't cost you a dime
To break my heart just one last time
Call collect and I'll just tell 'em "put her through"
Call me if you need a fool

// Continental Trailways Blues //

Well, sittin' in the depot long before the break of day
I just bought my ticket, Lord I hope the bus ain't late
I'll have a cup of coffee and a sandwich from the microwave

Now I'm gonna see my baby if it's the last thing I ever do
Got this sittin' in the station sick and tired of waitin'
Continental Trailways blues

Well rollin' out for Houston, man we're finally rollin' now
Try to get some sleep and listen to that highway sound
I guess we must have stopped in every single little town
Now I've bought myself a copy of the Natchez Mississippi News
With the just pulled out of Lake Charles rollin' into Sulphur
Continental Trailways blues

Now, we're rollin' into Houston, don't them city lights look fine
Headed for the pay phone, hangin' onto my last dime
Well, she says she's got a new man, Son, it's been a long, long time

Now I was standin' by the highway with the rain runnin' through my shoes
With the sittin' by the road side wishin' I was inside Continental Trailways blues
I got the wishin' I was downtown waitin' on a Greyhound
Continental Trailways blues

// Open Up Your Door //

Here I am sittin' on your porch, dear
Beggin' you darlin', let me in
In total submission I have come here
Oh sweetheart, I know how bad I've been

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door

If you tell me you still love me
I won't drink or cuss no more
I won't call your mama ugly
And I won't chase women like before

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door

I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway
I won't spit my tobacco on your floor
I'll come runnin' when you call me
If you just opened up your door
If you just opened up your door

// Breakdown Lane //

Baby, last night I was watchin' my headlights flashin' on the guard rail
Now it's early in the mornin' and I'm still runnin' like the devil was on my trail

Well, say why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay

Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
I feel my shotgun when I see my shadow
It's headed down the breakdown lane
Headed down the breakdown lane

Now I've heard all the songs about the endless highway
Sung a couple of 'em myself
But the road ain't nothin' but a place to go
When you ain't got anyplace else

Why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay

Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
I feel my shotgun when I can see my shadow
It's headed down the breakdown lane
Headed down the breakdown lane

// Squeeze Me In //

You know that it's been such a long time, honey
Since I've been ridin' next to you
I ain't a-waitin' in no long line, honey
You know I'm only passin' through

Well, I got here without warning
Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin'
You won't find me hangin' 'round your door tomorrow like your other men
Hey darlin', squeeze me in

I've been sleepin' by the road side, honey
Holdin' my suitcase next to me
You can't ignore me 'cause it's been tried, honey
I'm gonna get you, wait and see

Well, I got here without warning
Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin'
You won't find me hangin' 'round your door tomorrow like your other men
Hey darlin', squeeze me in
Darlin', squeeze me in

// Annie, Is Tonight The Night //

Here I am again, now, acting like a crazy fool
Every time I get to rockin', I always run into you
I never did understand why you want to be so cruel

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

I know you told me once
I guess you coulda told me twice
I guess I keep hopin' some day you're gonna treat me nice
I'm tryin' to get next to you
Cold as ice

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

Now I'm not fool enough thinkin' I'm the only one
Got me comin' and a-goin' 'till I'm about to come undone
Not tryin' to find love
I'm lookin' for a little fun

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

// My Baby Worships Me //

Let me tell you 'bout the girl of mine
Got her walkin' down th'assembly line
She bring the paycheck home to me
My baby, she worships me

She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me

Go tell her, she pays the bill
She make the payment on my Coupe de Ville
She leave a 20 for me every day
My baby, she pays my way

She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me

My baby, she treat me right
We ain't never been in a fight
Once she caught me with her best friend Sue
She just giggled, say "Ain't he cute?"

She like the way I walk
She like the way I talk
That woman can't let me be
My baby, she worships me

My baby, she worships me

// Cadillac //

Everybody's out to get me
See it in their eyes
Hardly see the way they look at me
When I go cruisin' by

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

I got chrome everywhere I need it
Rolled and pleated front to back
If you don't think I got it made
You ought to see me dressed in black

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

Now, if you've got a woman
There's one thing for sure
If you want to keep her
You best keep her from my door

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

Cadillac

Oh, Cadillac

// Devil's Right Hand //

About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
I saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store, when I was thirteen
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen

So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
She really blew up, and she didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand

Me very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
Shoots as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
It loads a mite slow, and soon I found out
It'll get you into trouble but it can't get you out

So about a year later I bought a Colt 45
Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
I never knew why, I didn't understand
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand

Got into a card game in a company town
I caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down
I shot the dog down, I watched the man fall
He never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw

The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand

The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand
