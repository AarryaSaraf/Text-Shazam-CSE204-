Album: StolenYouth

// Intro //

Live from Delusion
Die on the street or reside in the ruins
Running high from police, throw the nine in the sewer
25 is the least of the time that you're doing
Do or die, staying true to the lies on the stand
Right hand on the word of a god and forgive
All the wrongs that you did trying to live by your means
Breaking news 10 P.M. see your friends on the screen
And these bitches wanna talk about some mother fucking rap
Bullet holes in the home where my lil' brother at
Pigs parked on the streets so we can't shoot back
Spend a week where I sleep most can't do that
Might look half neat till the nightfall comes
First the good years screech then you hear that drum
Fuck 911 police don't come
Had Jabari on the streets till the sun came up
Momma son raised up in the midst of a feud
I'm from genocide where you die for your residence
Die for the presidents I chase
We reach the same fate so I never get to thrive in the relishment
Might seem jaded but even Satan was heaven sent
Coulda been a bum, broke sleeping by the 710
17, dropped out knew I had to make a way
Couldn't have my granny broke before she seen the pearly gates
Hope she ain't judge for me
Only person living never showed love to me
Dad did time cause he sold drugs for me
I could never judge a man trying to better off his fam
Shoot a fucker waist in
Gotta take you to your maker
Till I'm buried in the grass and the candle light the pavement
I'm gonna do it to the best of my abilities
The fear in me is gone, you can hear it in the song while you listening

// Fantoms //

Understand me nigga, Don't need no Grammys
Give us the money you got in your pockets, I feel like taxing nigga
Bout the action, give me a reason, I'll gladly get it knockin'
Chunky nine right by my side look like a midget walkin'
Watch the shit that you talkin', promise its with me often
I got to stop with the trigger talkin', I promised mama
But I'm rapping my life, I load automatics at night
Ops don't come to the Pop, they know they gettin' dropped
I getting on 'cause I be getting off, in my lane
You getting' no luck, get a job
I should throw my shows at synagogues
Mention me when you mention God
But fuck it, I'm just talkin' shit to y'all

[Hook - Joey Fatts:]
Young and gunnin', niggas stay drummin'
Big tools in your house, say we here for the plumbing
Niggas say they with it, but them boys frontin'
Choppin' shots with your block, fuck niggas say somethin'
Fuck niggas say somethin', fuck niggas say somethin'
Niggas stay drummin, choppin' shots with your block
Fuck niggas say somethin'

Chop a choppa down, they told me never run
Unless you hear them copper sounds, I got them copper rounds
Gunnin' for them gold plaques
A 2014 Benz with the low jack, Pirellis's and the pistol stack
Riding down Obispo Ave, thinkin' bout the bus days
Never goin' back to that, checks be coming back-to-back
Put you on the front page, have the homeys handle that
Pro club hoodie, straps, socks with the sandals wrapped
Long beach legend, Jordan kick me out
If you from the city, that should tell you what I'm really bout
Give 'em class to get the cash, run your mouth, I'll kick your ass
But I'm just talkin' shit again

[Hook]

// Heaven //

[Hardo:]
Fuck these bitches, I'm focused on business
Got 'em running in the hood like I bought a new engine
What these niggas try to save I'll spend in a minute
All this money in the way, niggas ain't in my vision
I was really on that block, I came up from nothin'
Putting everything in it, it was all or nothin'
Now these diamonds on my neck got all these bitches fuckin'
With a kid, they used to sin, now I'm the one who fronted
See this Rollie on my wrist, that thing glitter and gold
Eatin' off this old bread, all these niggas go mold
Middle fingers to the haters and niggas that told
Money over everything, that's the way that I roll

[Hook - Mac Miller x2:]
I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like

[Mac Miller:]
I got bitches, all I see is bitches, all I see is bitches
Windows tinted
Hide some people in it
We extremely lifted
Ain't no limits
Kids defying physics
Crucifying bitches
Ain't your business how I spend my time, I got bigger fish to fry
They telling lies, I swear to God
Heaven left 'em mesmerized
Everything ain't televised
When it rain, then it shines
Nevermind. Missing all the devil's signs
Hellen Keller blind, you need eyes
Then I'mma come and lend you mine
Every time I start walking proud, they wanna chop chop chop chop me down
I just wanna make out with Foxy Brown
Monday nights, shit raw for now
Close it up, yeah I lock it down
Smoking blunts 'til I'm Gangnam Style
Coughin' into my coffin now
Have a bad bitch, money, and a crocodile
With me
Rest in peace to Pimp C
Set me free
Need ecstasy
I just really wanna get my jet to leave
Go and play the front 9 at Pebble Beach
Just set some goals that I'll never reach
Get you high, seven leaves, never peak
Good energy 'til it's rest in peace

[Hook x2]

Running out of hope, running wild cuz my momma close
To dying while we broke, a youngest child, I always listened to my father
When he spoke, because he'd been through it all
A Chris Paul jersey hung on the wall in ninth grade
Back when niggas only wanted to ball
We used to steal from the mall and had to run from the guards
But now we run from the law with guns stuffed in our drawers
And all my chambers revolve cuz I can't risk gettin' caught
I got too much on my plate, I think a better tomorrow is what I'm trying to make
At least for most where I stay, I learned at a young age ain't no savin' 'em all
See some problems is born too far gone to be solved
I got a lot on my heart. Scorn the weary
Never believin' no woman, cuz bitches lie on the frequent
Live and die by this gun, niggas ain't shooting for fun
So run your pockets, we need it

[Hook x2]

// Guns & Roses //

Guns and roses, another young boy lost, another fallen soldier
Younger brother tears falling on his mother shoulder
She got some tears of her own, wished she had loved him stronger.
13 but he grown, you see the gun he holding
That was made for a man, the rush he get when he load it
Is one you won't understand, unless you hold it and blow it
Granny moved from New Orleans searching for better life
Her troubled cardiac is all she got
Eating at McDonald's by the laundomat
Daughter was 17, she just want to know where the party at
Met somebody that night, fucked him, he never called her back
Now her oldest bastard son sitting in that casket young

Guns and roses, another young girl lost, you see her heart was broken
She used to love so strong, until she got done wrong
Ain't wanna feel no guilt, she blamed it all on home
But still it felt so real, and since she lied so well
Her parents never could tell where she was really at
Now is it really love, or is it just another lie to fuck inside his mama truck
Raw like the emotions of her crying that night
Her pillow soaked, she missed the hope she had as a kid
But he doing all the things that her dad never did
He'll be the dad of the kid if she had it, but still he'd rather not
Steal her mother's car, hit the bar just to grab a shot
From the guns and roses
Living young and hopeless

Guns and roses, I had it all in my home but mother never noticed
The neighborhood where I roamed was known for countless encounters of people pressing they line
I try to stay in my boundary, when bounty's placed on your head for shit you never had did
You just conform to survive, not trying sit in no pit, I like me better alive
357's for 6, 11 fit in your 9
I take them both when I dip cause I ain't dying today
The shit's a game that we play what you bang where you stay
Before you answer just spray, they'll never see it coming
Hit a man, woman, child or dog cause it's mine before yours, its 2 weapons of war

Its guns and roses
Young
Victim of the guns and roses

// Back Sellin' Crack //

I done beat the breaks off niggas
Shot the face off niggas
Pending case with state, and I'm still out trippin'
All the feds take pictures, fuckin' up my image
Even mama bringin' drama, i don't trust no BITCHES
See these hoes be out here switching their sides
When its time for the killin i ride
Look right in my eyes, been ready to die, risk felony time for threatening mine
Better than I, nobody alive
Nobody live the life that i did
Fighting to live since I was kid
Playing in the yard with a 30-06
House look like a gun range
Room look like a gun store
Either you're gonna know my name, or niggas dying young and poor
Either way don't give a fuck, you gon find me northbound
With the shit, I'm in the shit
You know I love them gun sounds
7's cry, macs applaud
They taking shots, I had to call
You catch em out the shot gun, that's Roddy White from 50 yards
No body shots, I'm hitting jaws
Tryna run you Stephen Hawking
You see I mean this shit I'm talking
You don't want no problem

[Hook:]
Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
2 dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beating' down the ave, like we back selling' crack
Killing for the karma, but liven for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing wit they offer
Off em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

Where you at, where you from?
Cause its hot where I'm at
Any time of the day you get robbed you get jumped
It's a game we play, to get paid
From the wants to the needs to the young
Snakes slide through the grass
Blades slide in the back, of the used and abused
Tryna walk in my shoes
Get tripped by my fuse, too short
Ask God what you want, he said I want your life
Well I ain't live mine right
But if I do the crime I do the time
I ain't scared of shit, I was born to die
Extended clip, big .45 been quick to trip
Been lost my mind
When I die, please don't let mama cry
Cause she know it had to be him or I
And I got caught slippin'
Get a gun and go knock that nigga
Run up on him, no mask, no feelings, no room for that
They shoot at us, so we shootin' back
Burnin' shells till I burn in hell
And I'm cool with that, that uzi packed
I done learned a lot in these 19 years
Lot homies ain't shed one tear
God decide what my curfew is
So till that day, I'mma do my shit
I proved my shit, they know my name
Not proud of the outcome either have regrets or
Be out young, don't sleep

[Hook]

[ScHoolboy Q:]
I took the blue pill and it's evidence was shown
Homies from elementary some them niggas gone
I got this cocaine
But my stove ain't turning on
I got that knock-knock
Uuh, yeah you know
Riding in the whip for sure
No Ls in the whip for sure
All the homies strapped but it ain't for show
Tryna hit a lick, no envelope
Nigga, weed ain't the only thing get smoked
Cuz got ghost 'fore he even got ghost
Cuz got toast and he ain't old enough to drink
Shouldn't been singing
Now his ass Murder Inc
Sunny LA, where we never need a mink
Sunny LA, where the youngers don't think
Sunny LA, where the heat get sprayed
And every other word on the wall get K'ed
All the homies taking you to parking space
This my set, I ain't hearing whatcha say
Back then had to be in by 10
But out by 12
My man just said the word
I got the text on the cell
Back with the Locs raising Hell
Found out the homie in a cell
I know we hated school
But it's better than jail
Gotta thank God I was saved by the bell
Tryna spit bars
I ain't trying to live behind 'em
So I keep my face here
Right where I found them
Nigga my rawness
Fuck through a condom
Ready when I'm rapping
No wonder why they signed him
I'm with the house
So watcha still pining
Dead by the street lights
Boy you shining
Talk about you grinding

// Stuck In My Ways //

I wanna ask God why the Bible lied to me
Just full of politics, leaving niggas without a sin
Is it false prophets who forged the religious documents
I done spent my whole life sinning without a consequence
Momma trying to figure what the fuck my problem is
And why I gotta live this way
I know my path ain't straight
But in the field, don't nothing but grit matter
Just get it how you live and figure the shit after
Nigga, gotta get it before I die out here
Don't wanna see my momma cry out tears
Sitting below the earth
Cause Heaven's out of the question
But for what it's worth, we made the most out of the nothing they give us
Heart was frigid but both these boulders sit on my shoulder
I try to figure my motive for leaving niggas behind
But if my fate is defied, hope whatever messiah that sent me there
Knew he only did this shit for survival
I'm so

[Hook:]
Stuck in my ways
The love and the hate
Was both shoved in my face
Gotta stay on your toes
Head starts in the race
Just wasn't given to those
Who came up where I stay
Ya name up in the game
But start watching ya back
These hoes want what you got
Trying to plot on your stacks
Still the plot thickens
Yeah, they better hope God with 'em

Is black pride still alive, or was niggas trippin?
Cause last time I checked, we lost self respect
And some didn't admit it cause momma was with the business
And daddy was trying to fuck
He left, that's just his luck
Suppressed, nothing but anger inside that chamber
Aim from the other side so we hate him
No need explaining
Baby momma drama cause karma being a hater
Now it's lookin' like abortion, your momma doing the favor
Black Buick Le Sabre, creeping down the street
No tags on the whip so you sneakin' past police
25, two strikes, you don't need a number three
They pull you over, now you nervous cause the heater by the seat
So...

[Hook]

// Killin' Y'all //

[Ab-Soul:]
Black-lip bastard, destined to be a bastard Crip
But I passed on it to make classic hits
I pray I'm forgiven for not being down or
Putting the work in that certain niggas did, reason behind they service
In the pen partially why I don't write
I just pull it out the wind, sometime I can't sleep at night
I be thinking 'bout my friends, know they up to no good, it's all bad
I seen the yellow tape at Del's and almost had a heart attack
You never know with this shit, I don't understand
Kids carry cannons on Instagram, but crying when the cuffs on they hands
It's out my hands, it's two sides to every story
And I ain't a judge or signed up for jury duty
My youth was stolen moving too quick, it's sick, though
Cause Vince know what I know now when I'm 26
We still moving further, hope seeds grow to be
Trees and not just bushes hiding burners

[Hook:]
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without-

Call the gang unit, they know the name, foolie
I truly was built for the shit
I'm in the ring cooling right by where the enemies live
You know you can't kill a giant with a lucky shot
Aim for the head when you fuck with God Jehovah
I hopefully be speaking the colder the beat, snitching
We doming your niece, homies as cold as police
Momma had told us as kids never to shit where you eat
And got a clip for the heat, .357, I think I'm Itch Dawg
Niggas know I'm 65 'til I'm six feet
Under where they took us undercovers parked on Orizaba
Dogs up in the yard of the abandoned where we hide the choppers
I couldn't hide from the Karma, you see, it followed me
Fuck it! Get it cracking in public, these niggas rap for the fashion
They want the mansion, they puppets
A puppet master will bust and that chamber talk but I'm muzzled

[Hook]

// Thought About You //

I just want to get my bread
And talk my shit before I end up dead
I got all this blood sitting on my hands
I never gave no fucks so they understand why I feel this way
Just found God and I still don't pray
Cause Satan preys on the weak swear I can do it myself
Soul stuck in the beats it's like I'm crying for help
Still my expression is bleak because my momma ain't raised no bitch
Never take no shit from no nigga unless he want to see the black four fifth
From the ghetto where the oceans is, but all hope is lost
We know the laws and quick to break 'em once there's dough involved
Young age they wrote us off, guns blaze they go to court
I got a lot of homies gone product of they're broken home
But who's to say what's right and wrong, they ain't live it
Looking straight into their eyes still and they ain't get it

[Hook:]
But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I've ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

As far as music kid I'm innovative
Niggas pretend to hate it, influence you niggas favourite
You stupid believe in different, authentic you lack the stitching
Sitting when it's game time, snitching when you face time
What's wrong with you niggas?
See I was brought up where that talking gets you shot up at apartments
Where the bitch that set you up had told you meet her just that morning
Just a warning, my performance astounding
Everybody want something, get these niggas from 'round me
Tryna climb skyscrapers
Life is but a dream but is never what it seems
So I never leave my weapon at the house
Rather spend time sitting behind bars than in a grave
I'm getting paid trying to change from my sinning ways

[Hook]

Working on my thousandth time telling you sorry
Walking around pretending it ain't affect me
But nothing was further from the truth
Least I'm trying to re-coop
Just blame it on the youth
No matter what you feel or seen I was in it too
Probably more than you would ever believe
You gave me something I would never receive again
We probably won't be again
But, would you expect it though?
I'm just the nigga, that I promised you I was
When you swore that I was better
Was in it through the weather storm
Just was better moving on
There was a time I thought that I would never think about you again
You was the best friend a nigga could have
I used to call you when I thought that I would die that day
And you would calm me down and I would make my way
You probably should have stayed
It just wasn't your place

I thought about you today

// Sleep //

[Da$h:]
Catch me on a trunk night, throwin' up a dirt bike
English dikes on the back and they screamin', "Fuck life!"
To be honest, only fuck twice
My drug jacket got the thug stripes
I'm glad they hate me, they ain't love Christ or Mike Jordan either
Dip my blunts in ether, chase the last name of Aretha
When they hear me through the speakers man these niggas know I mean it
The mannerisms of a genius, models down to seen it
The flow is scenic
The ho is black, the car is European
Cream soda when we put the lean in
Fuck your team, your clique, whatever you bangin'
I come through blunt lit, bucket low, nuts hangin'
Like nigga what? Nigga yawk! Niggas know me
The fuckin' dollar, crossed to the dark side so it's fuck Obi Kenobi
You active, motherfucker then show me
I tell your fuckin' wife to blow me
Nigga, it's still fuck you (Still fuck you)

[Ab-Soul:]
Yo, still searchin' for Easter pink on Easter Sunday
Black lip pastor Herb done lit the herb and passed it your way
Master with the nouns and verbs, you haven't heard the wordplay?
I'm the most def here, shouts to black Dante
The stakes is high, who'd like to climb on my gate
Live from the last name of Kanye
I heard your whoop de whoop and blase blases
So when I cut you off consider Kendrick Lamar
You know it's all in the family tree
The helix of my DNA should read T-D-E, what can I say?
I left a acid tab for Da$h on his dashboard
I hope he don't crash tryin' to dash for it
Your bitch fuckin' like, like I paid cash for it
Motherfucker, Soul!

[Mac Miller:]
It's Young Fisherman sinkin' in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, so Minnie Riperton
Gettin' lit exquisite bitch, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinnin' as Bill Clinton, that's ill pimpin'
She butt-naked swimmin', I'm payin' her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show, I know you seen the crib
Nasty since a youngin' it's unsanitary birth
Watch this beat get buried in a hearse, yeah I kill myself
Mac hippy analog, rap midi turn the cameras off
I made you snap, I'll slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Clause
Mouth wide, I'm high as a satellite see
I'm in ancient Greece gettin' head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whities actin' like me
I set the bar high
This a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole in one on the par 5
Eyes closed drinkin' whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed

Never gave a dollar to the pastor
Hoes can't get inside my home without the password
My past worth was measured by those who got less then now
Safe to say you motherfuckers know you like my style
Paved the way for they new found vision
Now they mad at a nigga, call me dad when you preachin' boy
Never one for trippin', find me full-speed sprintin'
While they yellin' coldchain
Please tell me what it is and what it ain't
Niggas sniffelin', catchin' feelings while I'm laughin' to the bank
Chasin' bitches that they'll probably never get, what a shame
Meanwhile I'll be sittin' in this critical acclaim
Walkin' drowsy off a plane, drinkin' water in the rain
With your daughter tryin' to garnish her brain for future reference
I'm some shit you'll never see in the game
And if I could I'd explain, but this right here's the end

// Outro //

I'm here to tell the world I'm from Ramona park
Diving in the deep water like I know the sharks
Climbing in the king daughter I deserved the crown
They weren't fucking with ya boy, but they heard me now
Me and white boy Mac came to take them back
Way back, back when people used to learn from rap
I'm here to show you motherfuckers what I learn from Pac, Slim
Couple rounds in the clip down for burning that
Beats i murder that, beef i murder that
Heard the shooter yell NNer before he heard the mac
And even if that nigga didn't
Bet he know it's them
Black with a little bit of brown like a doberman
That 1911 hold 11
Go and call the 9-11
He just send his soul to heaven
Bitches say the shows is heaven sitting in the front row
Turned a couple Poly High games to the gun show
Turned a couple Wilson High gangs to the track meet
You be in to rap beef cause you ain't never have beef
Joey thats my brother so I'm part of all of Fatts beef
And you know my strap
Keep talking thats my black bitch

2-2-3 make a fat nigga black flip
One 16 wipe niggas off the map quick
Never had to show a lot of effort with the rap shit
Going for the kill cause I never really had shit
Same old stereo type, got the stereo hype
Hope when I die that I'm buried like Mike
Guys on that prize that ain't even my sight
If you want that fire then he leaving tonight to show
Two claps when I see my yaNNcs
Two straps been moved that across the interstate
Arizona homies call me Flagstaff shortie
Chrome Kel Tec nine and a big black 40
We be shooting up the parties like we got no sense
Ride around city trippin, we ain't got no tints
Hood been my home, I ain't got no rent
We be chillin' on the pop like we livin' on the pop
Never slipping, not trying to see the prison like my pops
Never giving you a pass if I consider you a Op
Don't consider you a threat if you ain't sending niggas shots
Got some killas with me down to put a nigga in the dirt
Light the candles on the curb, send a message to the cops
Snitch niggas in the feds sending letters to the cops
So I never trust a soul, when they ask I'm never speaking
My Baretta Scott King strong and black and she could be
Team trying to gangrene like that old Max B
Old French Montana, macaroni with the cheese
Young Joe Montana throwing bullets through your defense
They need Vince, you should put him on your team
If I die on these streets then consider me a martyr
Enemies ghost 5 deep in the charger
Down to shoot though cause I got that jumper
Been on that block this my 19th summer
Momma playing Stevie Wonder in the kitchen while she cooking
Pigs knocking at the door to take my dad to central booking
Reading books up in my room cause she won't let me go and play
Scared her youngest son will run around and go pick up a K

Fuck that shit you represent I'm here to get these presidents
Wouldn't be the only king to come up where the peasants live
Pray to god I never do the shit that both my parents did
History repeats itself, it's up to me to change it
Watch me burn the book of life and write the pages in my favor
On some King James shit
Call me Mr. on some Rosewood Ving Rhames shit
Keep a pistol in the Gap fleece
We aim quick, leave a nigga on the backstreets
Same old shit, you heard Stuck In My Ways
No the show don't stop, I could do it for days
If you disrespect my family we all gon' fight
Swinging like T Woods, trying to earn my stripes
Yeah that uppercut will fuck him up so say goodnight
