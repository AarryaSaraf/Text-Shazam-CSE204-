// Feels Like Summer //

[Big Boy's Neighborhood:]
Whatever day, vibe, month it is, it just feels like summer
You know what I'm saying?
It always feels like summer in the neighborhood man
When you get a chance to come in
You get a chance to lay back, you get a chance to laugh
You get a chance to chill, best believe that, man
And being that it always feels like summer
Let's go ahead and make you feel like summer

[Vince Staples:]
Summertime in the LB wild
We gon' party 'til the sun or the guns come out
JB first one fouled out playing ball
Now the whole city love you, how?
But we know they wasn't down from the get go
Dirty got a dozen rounds, better get low
Lil Johnny gave his life for this shit
All he got was a plot and a bottle from the Winco
Still Norfside, Parkside, Vince stole
Two wins, new friends, we skip those
Try finessin' my way into Heaven, might hit that gate
Might fall from a big spla
On the concrete, real street runner
First month still feel like summer
Cold weather won't stop no gunner
Wrong hat, wrong day, I'd kill my brother

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Ayy, summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Vince Staples:]
Scared money don't make money, hey
White man want take from me, hey
White fans at the Coachella, hey
Never been touched, niggas know better, hey
Same ways since Summer School Baby Jay
Either I'ma make the news or make a play
Pass Alyssa house, coulda took a different route
Wouldn't be without, think about it every day
Moved on, life fast like that
Still struggle with the past, I'm strapped
Somebody gotta watch my back
Everybody wanna count my bag
Ease off me, these streets taught me
Speak softly, please don't taunt me
Knowin' Vic and them stayed on 8th
If they killed me, then I'd be great
Now they lookin' at me

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Summertime in the LB
Know it ain't shit a broke nigga gon' tell me now
Drop top with the top down now
All the bad bitches gon' feel me now, ayy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Big Boy's Neighborhood:]
Here it is man, I told y'all, "Feels like Summer"
No matter when it is man, it always feels like summer in the Neighborhood
And being that it feels like summer, let's do this man
Let's go outside

// Outside! //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shit
(Ayy, when they play shit, shoot the party up)
Yeah, yeah (Ayy, when they play this shit)
Yeah, yeah, shit

Broad day, I'm 'round your way
SK, come out, let's play
Draco, that's a young nigga gun
Pull a trey five seven watch young niggas run
I'm out there, on Johnny head, you lackin'
I'm on yo' ass, we packed in
He ran on line, we catch him, we gon' blam his mind
No cappin', Park gangstas backed in
At my Uncle Phil house with the MAC-10
Up at momma Trice house that's street doubt
Little young, now niggas better calm down

Left side, who 'bout that life?
Right side, who 'bout that life?
Nighttime, who 'bout to die?
Outside, you know my mind
Westside, who 'bout that life?
Eastside, who 'bout that life?
Norfside, who 'bout this life?
Outside, you know my mind

Young and livin' gorgeous, reinforce wish
Prolly can't afford this, we in orbit
We gotta space and my face with the court shit
Never love, never trust, never gone switch
Niggas wanna press lines, so it's vest time
Pressin' in my best life, I'm a mess, right
Step first, in a march, we don't mess, right
Make him recess when we see him in the set

Left side, who 'bout that life?
Right side, who 'bout that life?
Nighttime, who 'bout to die?
Outside, you know my mind
Westside, who 'bout that life?
Eastside, who 'bout that life?
Norfside, who 'bout this life?
Outside, you know my mind

Niggas know the deal when I pull up in the pill
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma heat a nigga grill
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma go in for the kill
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
Niggas know the deal when I pull up me and Phil
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma really do a drill
I'ma, I'ma do 'em shitty, yes I will
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma

// Don't Get Chipped //

[Vince Staples:]
Can't wait til I'm rich, I'm finna buy a whole crate of guns
From 'round 90 Crips, shit I really came from the slums
Time to represent, let me see you bang, where you from
Don't be acting spooked, I'm a troop, I don't give a fuck
I just wanna live it up, used to make 'em give it up
Flockin' is for hoes, I'ma take somebody's soul
He gone give me what he own, now I'm getting what I'm owed
You might see me at a show, oh you missing out
Swear I bring the realest out
Everybody know me who's somebody to know (Somebody to know)
Watch me mind my business while I'm counting my dough (While I'm counting my dough)
Stay away from snitches who would clown me before (Clown me before)
On the road to riches they gone step on your toes

Sammy told me that a change gone come (Gone come)
I'm not going if my gang won't come (Won't come)
If you see me pull that thang don't run (Don't run)
Playing ball, if I swing home run

[Jay Rock:]
I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
My hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped

[Vince Staples:]
Everybody say it's lonely at the top
I want my homies at the top, my little homie he got shot
And now I'm moving my lonely with the .40 in the mop
Finna pull up early morning and somebody getting dropped
I throw a party on your block, like I'm Tommy the clown
Hundred thousand dollar car, bet you proud of me now
Took my mama out the set, house as big as my mouth
Started yelling out regrets, so I shot in the crowd, pow!
You a fan, I'm the man, it's a difference
Stop pretending, you know you feel it
Record deal, but I did it independent
If I peel then somebody going missing

Granny told me they just wanted me down
I'm the nigga that they wanna be now
Who done did it like I did it from the hometown
Start dead broke, but I'm on now

[Jay Rock:]
I ain't on that medication
It's only money that I'm chasing, that is all
Represent my location
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped
Nigga, I ain't got the patience, yeah
My hustle like a mental patient, I'm tryna ball
Let me run my demonstration
Don't get chipped, don't get chipped
Don't get chipped

// FUN! //

[Vince Staples:]
One time, circling the block
Lil' buddy got murdered on the flock
Two times, you know how we rock
You know who we knocked on, you know who we shot
You know how we comin', come from nothin', I got
Christian Dior, I'm Crippin' Bior
Made her uh-oh, let the mission endure
Gave a little money to me, now I want more
Don't be lookin' funny when we come up in the store
My black is beautiful but I'll still shoot at you, dawg
2Pac, death tells all
Watch out for the niggas in the Lakewood Mall
Bitch, you touch, Nobu brunch
No bit change, no blue Chucks
Just big things, cuz gon' bust
Cuz sure bust, but we ain't on one

We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck 'bout nothin'
We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck about nothin'
We just wanna have fun

[Vince Staples (E-40):]
I'm so Norfy, my loves go viral for me
Ride slow, hop out, get hyphy
Think I know why he no like me
He broke, we know, citch
He told, he on print
Black and white like old flicks
We blam, these bands like goldens, I'm hopeless
Give me all the money in my hand
Type of money pop a rubber band
Miss with the glitz and the glam
Fried catfish at The Ritz in Japan
Yeah, kickin' baby, tell me when to go (Tell me when to go)
Tweakin', I'ma leave him on the floor (Leave him on the floor)
Ricky in LA, adiÃ³s
But we don't want the smoke

We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'
Fun, we don't wanna fuck up nothin'
And we don't give a fuck 'bout nothin'
We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'

And we don't give a fuck about nothin'
We just wanna have fun
