Album: ShyneColdchainVol2

// Progressive 3 //

Yeah, back and blacker than ever
Got sick of waiting for these actors to get it together
Still in them gutters, all my brothers is birds of a feather
Tried to get this money cause my people done struggled forever
Son of my father, gunning for stardom, it's worth a shot
They hate me like I'm fucking their mama, that's why I serve 'em hot
Shells they burning, as long as hell is burning Iâll murder God
If he was trying to fuck up my paper, nigga, that's all I got
The black and brown been going through a holocaust
You see Obama just a house nigga to me
They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key
It's empty plates in this estate so shorty shit where he eat
He got a clip, he got a K, he âbout to light up the street
They catch him slipping, now they trip him knock him right off his feet
His mama crying on the news like "that boy was so smart
Wish he never start chilling with them niggas at the park"
Been swimming with the sharks since the kiddy pool
Breaking all the written rules
Breaking the tradition of that inner-city raising fools
A raisin in the sun
They let the monkey out the cage, he got a gun
He got a book, he got a brain, you better run
Was the one that they shun
Baptized in the tears of the slaves as a young
A penny saved is a penny earned
So I'll be stacking up this copper as the city burn
Cold chain, nigga

Yeah, just sit and look at where they raised us at
Seen black, same crack, so they gave us that
Give us hope then take us back
To the 1800's with these rap contracts
And they wonder why niggas get shot, coke sit in the pot
He can't get no job so he hitting the block
And if that nigga getting money while them niggas sitting hungry
Ten times out of ten bet them niggas gon' plot
We just struggle with survival trying to rise to the top
When your life is on the line fuck what's right and what's not
You got a right to the dream, whether it's triple beam or Martin Luther's
My chain heavy, is you ready for that revolution?

// Locked & Loaded //

I never needed nobody to believe in
I seen 'em change like the seasons
R.I.P., you just a candle on the cement
Once you leave so I've been trying to live forever, dawg
I got a .25 Beretta in my mama car
Same one my brother use, same one my father bought
Everybody telling when they go to court
I'm feeling like they don't make niggas like me no more
I still got slaves hanging from my family tree
The young still gangbanging like we WC
And Mac 10, Mac 10's sit up under the fleece
Because the powers that be just ain't fucking with me
Since back when there was white men under them sheets
Riding horseback, walking on the backs of the free
You see we in it to survive, what the fuck did you think?
At the blink of an eye niggas could die in these streets

[Hook:]
My life a movie, hope you liking the show
They act, we shooting, just a part of the role
The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low
I pray for blessings, grab my weapon when I walk out the do'
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
When I'm ready to go, when I'm ready to go

Hey, tell these niggas let the black man shine
This little light of mine, a nine I hide inside of my drawers
Ain't nothing ancient, mama, ey lil mama, ey don't start
I only pray when asking Allah how we made it this far
But still I'm all about the dollar, pass the offering jar
The thoughts of niggas on the bottom what I offer to y'all
We from the slaveship, all my niggas ride for the cause
We on the same shit, tryna survive all the loss
Because they ain't shit, won't take shit but the charge
Because we can't snitch, know you niggas heard it before
A child was murdered before, he had a chance to mature
And bet the one they didn't ever see outside of the bars
We the pride of Raymond Washington, they washing us off
Them baggy Trueâs fit just like them county blues
Mac 10 match well with my black skin
Little black boy shooting up the avenue

[Hook]

// Humble //

[Hook:]
Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit
I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you

White high school, wasn't laughing at the black jokes
Daddy had us contact high off of crack smoke
Had to get it cracking with the 7 cause the Mac broke
Wrist fucked up, couldn't make it to practice
Had the money in the couch and the K's by the mattress
Chasing senior bitches down cause we was hanging with Pac then
Sidekick thefts if he pressed him we packed him
Ski masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen
Mayfair freshman class, but I skipped them all
But Miss Brown cause that was my nigga
Ask me what mattered more, school or the set?
She can tell by the truancy I'm true to the shit
Couple months I was up out of there
Mama kicked me out of the house, but shit I didn't care
Hitting licks came to a drought so we was killing kids all for the buck
15 sitting shotgun, ready to duck?

[Hook]

I swear I'm busy every time my mama call my phone
No time for stressing, she can leave a message at the tone
I apologize for breaking up your happy home
And looking like my daddy, all them arguments was overblown
Girl, I just want you happy, that's the reason why I write these songs
Cause I can give a fuck 'bout where I end up when it's said and done
Riding down 7 Street looking for your second son
Found him on Artesia with a Yannc he had a loaded gun
But you ain't know the difference, coming home late
Seen Tyson in the kitchen trying to make his own plate
But you love my homies like you love your only son that walk and talk
Think that was the reason why you afraid to see me risk it all
But your father told me no reward if no risk involved
And your father raised me, made me crazy, don't take shit at all
I know you miss him cause I miss him more and I can't quite recall
Knew he would be happy as the day my mama had me, see

[Hook]

// 45 //

All the time, all the time, all time
All the time, all the time, all time
Aight, you ready?

What do you believe in? Die to have respect
I believe that the world got black neglect
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet
County blues, counting days till you get set free
Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P
Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets
Caught a case cause he wouldn't catch a fade
Living pedal to the metal cause he couldn't catch a break
Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way
I'm still waiting for the day that we black and we proud
Till then we'll be shooting niggas down to the ground
Sing it loud

[Hook x2:]
All the time, all the time, all time (all the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy
45 sitting side when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it

Fuck the world shit lately, black 380
Ready for wherever God gon' take me
On my momma I been out here since a young nigga
World tours and prison letters in my bunk, shit this life ain't yours
See, we fighting a chore rather, kill a nigga quick
Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit
Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate
Now they love to see me rattle sitting in that cage
Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith
I was born with a heart that the streets can't break
Never poured one shot, never rolled one J
Cause I don't need that shawty, point me to that bank
I ain't never had no money, nigga
Young and bummy so I had to be the funny nigga
Got a gun, started wilding like a dummy, nigga
I don't care about no murder just another nigga
Pull the fucking trigger

[Hook]

// Oh You Scared //

Nigga, what's the deal? Pay attention
Most the time that I've been living we been public housing tenants
Never had no pot to piss so bitch excuse me if I brag a lot
Niggas never had a shot unless you talking .38 that Wak had got
Can't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught
But you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still
So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison
Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby
My temper short, that anger made me have days in court
In my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse
Got student loans and you failed the course
Of course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out
Niggas been turnt up, no need to stop now
Speed up, skeet up then air the block out
El Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat
Once you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes
Make him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys
Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing

[Hook - Jhene Aiko:]
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
You getting bread, ain't ya?
You getting bread, ain't ya?
Ain't ya? Ain't ya?
(Nigga, where my money at?)

If Illuminati buying souls and only fear was dying broke
God who made my life this hard so hell where we decide to go
Could you really judge us knowing us then close to what was given
Father up in prison, Jesus here, but he ain't struggle wit us
The church only made shit worse
The money we was given ain't go to God
Mostly nice cars that Reverends could sit in, destined for jail
We just some niggas facing sentence, we sitting at a standstill
You broke, but you the man still trying to find your plan still
Two kids and mo' bills, food stamps and dope deals, hood life with no frills
But still they swear they feel you and never been close to near you
Once who preach protect and serve the main ones trying to kill you
It ain't no path to life, no prepping for no afterlife
It ain't no wrong or right, it's just the shit you do and shit you don't
Friends that's killing niggas is the only ones you praying for
But words, they never stopped no bullet
Oh, you scared, nigga?

[Hook]

// Trunk Rattle //

My momma cried the day I got put on the hood
Never wished for better days, only wished a nigga would
Never been a pump faker, that won't do your boy no good
Still shoot it like a free throw, hammers that the chicos get
Daddy threw it off the glass like a bank shot, shit
I'm just trying to get the money that the bank got flip
Like a monster truck, banging never disturbed me
That's the only time I see niggas balling without a jersey
At apartments we used to loot, them poppy niggas'll shoot
Homies taught me 2N's ain't need no friends
I need a black panamera with the black 2-10's
Told my momma I would make it so the story begins
Begins

[Hook:]
Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch
Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live, nigga
Got a whole lot of problems at the crib
Got a chopper at the crib since I hopped up out the crib, nigga

Tell me what's the deal, I'm trying to make a mil or somethin'
Tell me how you feel, these haters want a hundred
So it's cameras in the crib, cock hammers in the whip
Champagne for the pain, gram stacked up in the spliff
Blow the back out on the bitch who only want you for the dough you got
We know they know you know, but still we got them hoes up in the spot
Getting hot and bothered sinning in this sign of smoke
I put that on my momma, not a nigga living that stop the show
Promise that we did it way before we ever heard of rap
Niggas say they shooters, where your jersey at?
We catch you where you lurking at
Been to hell and church and back, all in granny Cadillac
Matter fact she had that Eldorado parked on Colorado
Called us if she had a problem, cousin Jerry had a rocket
Back when Common had you tryna to read Qu'rans and go to college
But forget about it

[Hook]

// Nate //

As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
"Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!"
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

[Hook:]
Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand
Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

[Hook]

[James Fauntleroy:]
No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

[Hook]

// Turn //

Woke up walking on water
Ditching my alma mater
Made a lot of mistakes from mimicking ways of my father
Father can you forgive me? Sinning since I remember
Back when grandaddy died, that was a cold December
They closed his casket while my motherfuckin hope was in it
Soon as you come out the womb they hanging rope for niggas
Groomed for the stone and the tomb, going for broke and shit
We've been that, push shit back, the Devil coaching niggas
Telling 'em to shoot, like a title on the line
When it's judgment time I doubt that God can look me in my eyes
'Fore He send me down to Hell cause I'mma ask a Nigga Why?
Never played it by the book because the Book was full of lies
And the preacher full of shit, and the teacher full of shit
Used to boo me from the bleachers that I'm never gon' forget
Eating $5 Little Caesar's pizzas on the WIC
Cause my daddy left my momma for the motherfucking pen

[Hook:]
But when it come down to it, know I'm out here shooting
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
When it come down to it know the basehead use it
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
Find me posted on the block, cause it's all a nigga got
Couple hundred in the knot, cause it's all a nigga got
Still running from the cops
Cause it's all a nigga got [x2]
Cause that's all a nigga got

Our Father who art in heaven
Seen my momma dying every day since grade 11
You see her age is catching up to all them years of stressing
Tears is falling and her son too far away to catch 'em
Hard to call and when she call she gotta leave a message
Cause a nigga working
And I'm working so she worry free, guess I defeat the purpose
Medication cost a arm and leg, hardly even worth it
Doctor tripping so it got a nigga feeling John Q, wild
Round sitting in the gun, duck duck goose style
Pressure building up, nigga, what you gonna do now?
Brother kid too now, 12 years in the pen
Seen life end 'fore this shit begin
Sing it then

[Hook]

One for the fucking money
Two for the fucking show
.357 on me, loaded ready to go
I know my bitches love me
Know my enemies don't
My momma know I'm shady
I'm granny bastard baby
Look in the mirror like this is what you made me
I'm going crazy please somebody save me
Jesus way too far gone for him to reach me
To reach me

// Shots //

Niggas die off of Poppy street
Bet my mama vouch, they drive by
We don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out
On my grind, Benz color of the crimes I've been committing
I've been fighting all my life and I ain't stopping 'til it's finished
Rapid fire power sound just like a helicopter engine
Hell ain't threatening to niggas who ain't never had religion
In this field you Phillis Wheatleys ain't gon' never catch me slippin'
Serve that brick piece, now we sneaky, sell 'til the man come and get 'em

[Hook:]
Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war
They sending threats, we sending shots
They sending threats, we sending shots

Fuck the pigs alive and dead 'cuz they ain't never had my back
See you black, 'fore you a man, and you a nigga 'fore you that
And that you'll never understand if you done seen it second hand
You ain't ready for that war then please don't step across them tracks
Rent money low and pressure high, no sellin O's just selling dimes
These California sunny skies done looked down on me all of my life
Is you really bout' what you write? Know they waitin' on my demise
And I been waiting too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky

[Hook]

Martin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better
Bunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us
To that Ghetto Promise Land, it ain't no hope for the darker man
Just the folks who you bump for the Arm & Hammer, the nigga prolly gone die when his mama had em'
That fleecy mattress fit 3 or 4, taking shit when we leave the store
Ain't a shoulder to lean up on, chauffeur in the back, the police been called
Same ol' gauge, same ol' trigger, same ol' cage, brand new nigga
Front page when you kill em', mothafucka pay attention

[Hook]

// Earth Science //

Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance and I appreciate it
Understand that over time our word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place swear to god I'll attend
I should've took you to prom
Fuck whoever had did but I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there, you was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking how we got here

[Hook:]
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you [x3]
No I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you [x3]

Remember walking to your house everyday of the week
Nothing else I had to do and you was something to see
Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans
Still text you every night before I wander to sleep
Never told you this but you was why I went to seventh period
Truant student but you told me I should take it serious
Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with
Standing in your living room meeting your fam'
Know it hurt you when they ask you what had happen to him
When you see me on the t.v. know I'm glad you're my friend
Wish I had more but I don't
Never running out of hope really I'm just waiting on you

[Hook]

As for you I always think about our kids that you killed
Understanding at the time you didn't think we was real
But as a man I felt I let you down, we was on our second child
That you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile
It make me see the way y'all try to plan for us all
When I look back at my life I'm glad I had you involved
If I ever need somebody you the first imma call
Said that you would do it all just to see me alive
In the back seat, steel beats, tears in your eyes
Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie
But whatever help you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away
Sorry if you called me and told you I can't talk today
Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs
Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone

[Hook]
