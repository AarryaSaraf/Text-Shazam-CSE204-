// Let It Shine //

This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

// War Ready //

[Andre 3000:]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God... with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock a... put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

[Vince Staples:]
Born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, war ready, your boys' lost already

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think I'm heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or I'm embracing silly
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thing to a G
Life give lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Coke game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fucked to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, hell, free, jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit
A wise man once said that a black man better off dead
So I'm, war ready

// Smile //

How you doing everybody hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall I know the fraudulent I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo'
I made enough to know I'll never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the street where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning please set me free
I hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me
Can't you see?

Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me

Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Cause when life gets hard
And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you can't breathe
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
Smile for me

How you doing everybody hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up

// Loco //

[Vince Staples:]
I load the 44
Then paint the Van Gogh
She rang the front door
She came commando
She came and rambled
I came and rolled over
No time for conversations cold shoulders
Outta my mind
She outta red wine
She woozy bitch bourgeois straight from Dubai
She love the hip hop and love my slick talk
Give head then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce
Don't need the Rolls Royce
I need a straight jacket finna go bat shit
Sick of these rapper stealing my swagger
Tryna run with the penmanship practiced
Gangsta gone Gatsby
Fades with no lotion
Get this shit cracking
Crack his jaw open
Crack in my system
Daddy loved smoking
Like he loved smoking niggas no joking

[Vince Staples & Kilo Kish:]
Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody gets a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind

[Kilo Kish:]
It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need
Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for 3 days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

[Vince Staples:]
Lemme tell ya 'bout, when a nigga went crazy
At the Marriott, having Kurt Cobain dreams
Lemme tell ya bout, when a nigga went loco
Ace hotel shoulda stayed at the Soho
Housekeeping keep knocking on my door though
Don't she know I'm staring in the mirror with a 44
Tryna get my head straight
She tryna get the bed straight
No room to think
KABOOM on the sink

Uhh me tienes harta
(Pinche baboso abre los ojos)
Quien te cres eh? El muy chingon?
(Date cuenta de lo que tienes)
Tu no eres nadien
(Ya no eres ni√±o)
Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal, eres un estupido no sabes nada
(You're a grown ass mutherfuckin' man)
Nadie te toma enserio
(I fuckin' hate you, just leave me the fuck alone)
Sabes que, vete a la chingada me caes gordo
(Pinche puto desgraciado)
Pinche vato pendejo
(I fuckin' hate you)

[Kilo Kish:]
Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody gets a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind

It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need
Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for 3 days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

[Vince Staples:]
In the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming
Out the window
Tints low baby come and see 'em where the rent low
Been gone I don't need a shrink I need a hit song tryna show the world a nigga
Tweaking
Been a schizo crip though off of 65th though
Anybody killer I ain't aiming when the shit blow
Jumping through your window finna hit a lick mode
Thugging since the flip phone don't be who I flip on

We all waste away, what are you looking for?
We all waste away, what do you got in store?
We all waste away, cause I can't take much more
We all waste away, rather be lost and poor
What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe
What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free
Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve
Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep
"But you a star," they say, "You mean so much to me
Mean so much to me"

// Prima Donna //

[Vince Staples:]
Kick cack ce cool, watch a nigga get it
I be all around the city with the semi naughty crippin'
All the homies say I'm different, police say I raise suspicion
Buy a million dollar home and blow my dome to paint the kitchen
Bitches like, "Is that Venetian?"
Niggas salty when they meet him
Cause they never finna beat him
And they'll never get a feature
I'm a star, tell Billy I'm a bill him for the sneakers
You conversin' with a nigga, better be about the green
I've been broke, I ain't goin' back
Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back
Call me King Latifah
If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper
Better keep her in the house
Watch your mouth
Don't be screamin' from the bleachers, nigga

Is it real?
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real?
Real, real
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real, real? Is it it real?
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant
Once you get addicted to it
Is it real?

I just wanna be DaVinci baby
Why they wanna kill me baby?
Feelin' like a pop star, music drive a nigga crazy
Think I'm finna pull a Wavves on the Primavera stage
On some prima donna shit, finna throw it all away
I don't need no accolades, boy I'm here to act a fool
Ask about me, had the shotty, robbin' niggas at the school
Me and Pac Slimm, we been shootin' since the Vans song
Pullin' any trigger that a nigga got his hands on
Lookin' at my vida, all this money, all these visas
All these mothafuckin' mini mes I know they wanna be him
Either with it or against it nigga, ain't no in-betweenin'
If you say you wanna kill the man then dump it when you see him pussy

Is it real?
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real?
Real, real
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real, real? Is it it real?
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant
Once you get addicted to it
Is it real?

[A$AP Rocky:]
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it

Little sunshine
Fed up with the gun violence
Fed up with the old rules
Fed up with the youth dyin'
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
Fed up with the songs singin'
Fed up with the gang bangin'
Fed up with the same things
Fed up with my life changin'
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better

// Pimp Hand //

What you thought it was nigga I'm the man round here
Hands down man down by my grandma crib
On the east
Riding round don't be slipping
Don't Blood me cause whole Long Beach Cripping
No cease
Firing I'm fired up tripping
In A NY fleece wasn't playing no Biggie
WCand Trey D keep shit crippy
No boot camp clicking we was food stamp flipping
Tryna eat
1st of the month re'd up 15th
Quarter punch ice cream trucks police
Stay tryna lock niggas up
Foes wacking out the set then we shot niggas up
No peace
No love not not clicking up
Swapmeet whites and a Glock in the trunk
OG's tryna tell a nigga bout the game
But it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same on me

Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong

Well I was born by the river not baptized in it
Loose lips sink ships who capsize quicker
Not we
Stay low-key no snitching
Since soul glo dripping and the sherm stick dipping
Tread light
Snakes gone bite on sight
Niggas battle with the judge like the gavel got a grudge
Face life
Still fight never been a punk
Chase dough hoe never get enough lemme tell you bout the flocks
Looking for the tents mama gotta pay the rent
Kicking in the back door tell me where it is
Come up out the safe or its coming out the clip
And I don't hesitate washing money like the sins
Attention getters hit detention centers
Before I break the bank, boy ill break and enter
Both ears to the streets listen in a drought
Cause when money coming niggas get to showing out

When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong

// Big Time //

Alright, alright, alright

Man I love my bitches
Man they photogenic
Snatched em straight up out they Richardson mag they do my dishes
Man I love this Cripping
Man my homies with it
All these murders they ain't got enough ambulances with 'em
I ain't paying homage to nobody with no bodies
I don't care bout yo Ferrari I'll snatch you out that Bentley
Was cramming into Civics 'round 2010ish
Piled in the studio when not a nigga would listen

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Player shit player made
I'm stuck in my player ways
I just made a play today
She gave me some play today
My Jordan was lawaway
I caught me a fade a day
Around where Janaya stay
My 40 go dumb in a major way
I come from the game where they pay to play
These rappers extorted like everyday
That Yankee I'm sporting like every day
Just played me a show they paid 80k
I put it away for a rainy day
You never know when you gon catch a case
You never know when you gon catch an opp
We kill ever day like where Sosa stay
You might get a pass

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Big timer like Manny and Baby
Don't play with that man cause he crazy
With Demon and Ocho from Bompton
They stomping out niggas like Stacy
The radio never gon play me quit if my label don't pay me
I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z
Bandana like Jayo from Daygo's
My temper depend how my day go
My girl do whatever I say so
She ain't got no reason to say no
I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich
You ain't seen how grimey my hood get
I been on some up to no good shit
You on that Cuba in Boyz N da Hood shit
I go down to Cuba and find me a plug
Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs
Sick of this industry playing these games
Sick of my enemies saying my name
Harder than niggas since Hollister nigga
I'll body a nigga for saying I can't
You should have known I go hard in the paint
You should have known ain't no stopping my wave

Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Next time on Poppy street
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?
