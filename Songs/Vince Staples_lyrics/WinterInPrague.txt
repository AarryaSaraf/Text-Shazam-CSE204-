Album: WinterInPrague

// Winter In Prague //

Yeah Nigga
They told me they need a leader
I told them niggas my feature price
Music mean nothing to me if I ain't eatin' right
Momma told me better see the light before they cut him off
Fuck what's wrong and right if it's a gun involved
Then I'm drumming off, Nigga
Ricky Ricardo going where only God knows
Beatin' the block I'm feedin' the block
They want us all broke. Women getting they heart broke
Prison is where our dads call home
So we don't see 'em in our homes
Nigga we from Long Beach
So Dre and Eazy never been our heros
And California niggas that see plays is weirdos
Lying like a mothafucka
Soon it's gon' be niggas dying like a mothafucka
Fry em' like a mothafucka
I'm sick in my thoughts and sick in my soul
Never let a bitch in my heart nor a bitch in my home
Why care about a broad when all my family gone
So till' they free the packs fuck true love I don't believe in that
You run your mouth then I'm meetin' that
I won't tweet you back
I'll just see you black out
And leave you passed out
Bleedin' and shit
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
Take a nigga life he ain't got no plans
We anybody killer we ain't got no friends (No friends)
Now back to the story at hand
They handed me nothing, I took it in stride
Take a shot at your head
For taking shots at my pride
The only son my momma got that she can talk to
So you don't want no problems, that's never been a smart move

// Lord //

In '76 you know they stop fighting
Niggas start shooting
You know it was something new to me
You know we use to fight all the time
The next minute I'm runnin from gunshots
So, the only thing I said to myself
Say man are we gonna start doing what they're doing
You know the same thing they do to us
We do to them
[?] but you had to either do or die
Or stay in the house
You know fight or stay in the house
So I wasn't gon' stay in the house for nobody...

I ain't never really care about shit
Soon as my father abandoned his kids
I was down for the problems
I promised my momma
I wasn't gonna die, so I got this revolver
Hammers will heal what a fist can't fix
Won't get down I'mma sent 'bout six
Ain't no question I'm wit' that shit
On the highway to hell
But it still ain't jail
Gotta plug in the scale
Tryna make this money
Crooked ass police tryna take this from me
Either watch yo step, or you catch that weap(weapon)
Niggas take your life 'cuz you ain't worth shit
Tell my momma don't trust not a soul that she meet
9 times outta ten niggas just like me
Tryna some up off the next man
Hammer in my left hand

[Hook:]
Voice from grandma yelling from the dead
She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleedin
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cuz
God don't come when there's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'mma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway,sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

My brother Smalls, told a nigga focus on the money
But why try when they tryna take a nigga under
Spend a thousand every-time a nigga make a hundred
And they wonder why I'm wild when I'm out in public
Demons form in the presences of nothing but struggle
It's easy to hustle when knowing nobody love you
Ain't nothing to lose
This money to gain
Fuck playin' by the rules, shoot him his brain
Life change when you take shit by the range
Sitting in the rain wit' a Glock nine
Waiting for the bus on Ximeno
I wish a bitch would roll by on some funny shit
Niggas know I got mines
Hard times make nigga face hard time in a cell
Never heard of hell, only heard of home
Hardly ever there
Shit I rather roam

[Hook x1]

If 1st and 2nd Corinthians
Could give a nigga spinnin rims or Christina Milian
I'll prolly give that shit a chance
Coulda went the college route
But I choose the nigga plan
Broken heart sitting on my path try and watch my step
God bless a child with a gift then he turned his back
Told him choose his own way
Guess I choose the wrong way
But it's only one way
Either wit'the gunplay
Or you getting dumped on, nigga ain't a soul safe
I live my life as if a nigga could get killed tonight
Niggas running at they mouth like they wanna die
I ain't the passive nigga most would probably wanna try
In the land of the lost only the strong survive
Ridin' round wit' 4s under the seat
In a four door jeep that's 400 hundred degrees
Looking for my enemies
They haunt me when I sleep
So any motherfucker that taunt me getting shot

My name is Vince Staples
I don't represent nothin..
It's gonna be for you niggas real soon
It's gonna be over for you real soon

[Hook:]
When intensity is risen
Women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love in the first place
Gave it up on the first date
Now she fucked in the worst way
(we don't love these hoes)

She was cute, was only trying to fuck her though
But I broke the rules, now I gotta come for hoes
Told her from the jump, that I wasn't into loving hoes
And she wouldn't be any different from my other hoes
Since a young nigga, I knew she would become a ho
Eighth grade year, sucking dick behind the bungalows
Daddy had a bunch of dough, paid her no attention
Only paid the whole tuition, gave her extra cash for spending
She was pheeming for the type of life she wasn't given
Hanging with them shady niggas in and out of prison
Thought a baby was the perfect way to keep his interest
Soon aborted when she saw he wasn't fucking with it
Cold nigga, gut checked, but she rolled wit it
Packed up, left home, took her soul wit him
Now it seems that she's only good for one thing
The one thing that we all need
Eyes dry, but her heart bleed

[Hook]

[Sk La'Flare:]
Yeah nigga im out here shinin
You see me bitch, I dont see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on twitter though
Where you hidin at? Imma find you
Little word of advice bitch nigga
Dont sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma's house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it to
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me

[Hook:]
Tell all the girls clap your hands
You comin' out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands
But I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can someone tell them broads
They comin' out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all
Where's my round of applause at?
We cashin' all checks
Don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime

I'm takin' niggas bitches
Like Bowser, I pound her
You hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
Niggas act like the women
They crying over, Invite her over
Dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route
Where everything I do
Where some little shit to me
Could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring
To a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical
Been crackin' hoes since secondary school
We trappin' hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga

[Hook]

// Matlock //

Turnt down niggas get they bitch shot at
Catch ya baby momma slipping at the laundrymat
Got the whole crowd cheering like Fonzie back
My army strapped, blazed where Bonzi at?
Got em wishing at the well that they see a nigga fail
Rather see me in jail then doing well like the white folk
They ain't even want Mike Jones, still tippin
Leave the tip on the table as I serve you niggas
I still ride around the city like I murder niggas
Bad hoes get Roethlisberger'd
No lies, preserve
Curb That, Enthusiasm just a lil bit
We ain't' fucking round with them rounds, cuh they still equipped
Warfare, Guerrilla clips, hold that, throwback, Darko Milicic
Sons got lojack, find ya babysitter crib, run up in that ho and blow that lil' muhfucka away
Is it wrong if I say, I'm feeling better than anybody's ever been
Herring Bone chain and some skeletons, pelicans
Rap niggas telling fibs, you ain't really selling shit
If you is, lead yo crib up like cheap paint
I tell my niggas C-safe cause the beach ain't
Most the niggas telling you to practice what you preach fake
You never talk about the dirt that you do
Cause in interrogation pigs can say that heard that from, you

And real niggas don't play by the rules, we just go hard
In yo front yard with the tools, let em dump off
Called Matlock, got the case dropped
Riding all around yo city with the safe off [x2]
Nigga...

// Traffic //

Nigga I don't got no homies
Forty on me like I'm Kemp
Oxycontin smothered the 'partment
And I'm trappin' like a bitch
Movin' molly monthly
My momma asked how I make the rent
I make the rent by making flips
Livin' like it's '86
I'm tryin' to sign for eighty bricks
Been listenin' to Gucci a lot
But I ain't goin' out like Dunkin
And so I'm thumpin'
Niggas hardly down for dumpin'
Let it bang like Chief Keef
Aim at the police
Paint up your whole street
Twelve gauge, big as a flamethrower
I'm feelin' like Kane in Wrestlemania
Shells inside that chamber duck
Honey hit your famouser
Hoes be in that Fetal stance
Firearms big as Digimon now watch my diddy dance
Flip a gram to get a grand
Real niggas stay masked up like Rick Hamilton
Tryin' to get my dough stacked up and buy the Vatican
Ninth grade Mayfair High, I snuck the hammer in
Glock's nine the match was ten

[Hook - SK La'flare x2:]
Ay, bitch I'm really on it, on it
Y'all silly, me funny
I traffic willy still I'm pumpin'
My pockets gettin' swolen
It's my grams rollin'
Bitch clips loaded, yeah

This a game you gotta shoot to play
My burner givin' boosie fades
Long Beach pb killa, I'll take it to my grave
Fuck the first forty eight and any nigga sayin' shit
We got the same guns as police and quick to spray a bitch
ARs and shit, get your whole department lit
Forty fours like Maravich
No droppin' dimes or shot attempts
Fuck the swine, I'm in the streets
Seven days out of the week
Still ain't reach my peak
So just take your seat and enjoy the show

[Hook]

// Black Oprah //

I need a sixty minutes
We leave you on the cement, we creeping, the windows tinted
My nigga, Iâve been authentic
You mad âcuz you minuscule
I will snatch your forbidden fruit
Show your daughter what dickâll do
Crime rate through the roof, one time missinâ proof
To sit us in the cell, so we givinâ niggas hell
Ship it, zip it, sit it on a scale
Do it in reverse though
Fuck being broke, itâs way too commercial
Bruh did things shouldâve been in a hearse for
Bodies on the waterfront, washed another hurt soul
Never gave a fuck though
Laughinâ in the gun smoke
Hammers like the depot and tablets like the drug store

[SK La'Flare:]
Itâs HOVÂ­
Got the block on swollâ like Sub Zero
And you know, Iâm La Flare, I ainât got no heroes
Tell them niggas to beware. We ainât got no fears, ho
This is rare, you could find them niggas at Sears, though
Iâm one of a kind, I donât even try
Gunnin to shine, Iâm running your mind
Killing these niggas, one at a time
Play my song, the function is mine

[SK La'Flare:]
And thatâs real talk nigga
Donât act like you donât know
Itâs money

[SK La'Flare:]
Ey itâs Horus, Horus, and my bitch is gorgeous
She icy like Isis, she shine like the morninâ
Goddess iron ma white tee, she know Iâm important
Ma dro imported, and my plug deported
Heâll be back by fall though
Iâm in the trap, no walls ho
Cookin CRACK in that loft ho
Work packed in that Tahoe
I serve packs with barcodes
U slackin like Waldo
You was acting and got robbed ho
You should get a job ho
This path, is not meant for you
Messages not sent for you
You in too deep, Iâm in the coupe
Suede seats, she feel the truth
Donât hate me, I'mma take her to a new world, new order
This feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu, something new-Â­-Â­
I thought I told you
