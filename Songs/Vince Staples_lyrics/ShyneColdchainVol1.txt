// Progressive 2 //

Uh
Time is money motherfucker, and money matters
Automatics make em' panic like it's East Atlantic
Jordan High summer school with my nigga Savage
Back when I was tryna' plot on fucking skinny Jasmine
Had a couple tablets we was pitching like Santana
Times was hard we ain't have no God, but we had hammers
Don't ever put me in a box with you rap bastards
Came from a different struggle, niggas had a different hustle
Never been suburban, piled in a Suburban nickel-plated Gervin
Hope they ready for that thunder cuz' my K.P. never on safety
Fortified with that .45 so who wanna' die
Just another product of my mothers pride
Smothered in my mothers lies Christ never died foe' me
But I know some niggas that'll give they life foe' me
You niggas can stick to praisin' and my niggas will stick to bangin'
If I die today remember me like Curt Henning
Perfect in every way
Now let the devils pray

Never been a bitch
Hit a couple hundred licks
Stash the money at the crib
Momma going through my shit
Had to pass it off to Nick
Now we out in Carson
Went and faced a couple charges
But I'll never snitch
Empty clips on my enemies, Like I'm Pac
Never catch me on the block
Niggas out here trying to breathe
No point in standing on the street
Fuck what you see
I'mma make shit happen
My fam don't eat
Then them dogs 'gon scavenge
Ash, this shit Bracking
Nigga that's blood cracking
Blogs muckrackin'
There's nothing here to see
'Less you tryna to meet the future
Chillin' with a couple shooters
And the truth that's in this music
Then you must see
Me

// Trigga Witta Heart //

Rap ain't never did shit for a nigga with no options
You want some positivity go listen to some Common
I'm here to bring you knowledge that they left out at your college
Where you paid a hundred thousand
Just to fall behind anyway
All in the white man's plan to just assimilate
The nigga's if they stopped they business
Let the monkeys intergrate
Abraham Lincoln never kept none of my niggas safe
Only gave them prison dates
And Church's Chicken dinner plate's
Columbus is beloved
When the fuck will Malcom get a day?
Probably never, Try to hide the truth
But they hardly clever
Only show the youth
House niggas wear Cosby sweaters
Wisdom scripted in the prison
Letter's that my father sent us
Waiting for Armageddon
Still slangin' that Arm & Hammer
Use them Cop's as target practice
They owe us a couple L's
How we 'gon know the future when we barely know ourselves?
It ain't hard to tell
The nigga's got it hard as hell

[Pac Sample:]
When I say Thug Life, I mean that shit
Cause these white folks see us as thugs
I don't care what ya'll think
I don't care if you think a lawyer, If you a man, If you an african-american
If you whatever the fuck you think you are
We thugs and nigga's to these motherfuckers
You know
And until we on some shit
I'mma call it like it is
How you going to be a man and we starving? You know?
And we walk down and 5 different houses and not a man in either one of them motherfuckers?
How we going to be a man?
How we gonna be African-Americans and we--

// Baron Davis //

[Pac Sample:]
We thugs
And we nigga's
Until we set this shit right

Sometimes I wonder how my whole city hate me
When them the niggas that made me
I'm guessing that's just the way it go
They say I sold my soul,
When I never had it in the first place
Hades was my birthplace
Crazy is the word they
Used to describe my tactics
Of Islam practice
Mixed with my mother's lies
I'm just trying to get my piece of the pie
Before I end up deceased
Ain't no need to reply
When I ask them "Who's fucking with me?"
Cause I know the answer, Nigga
No love for the Devil
But for the moment, I'm dancing with her
Just trying to get my money up,
So that I can pay for my brothers
Cause at the moment they banging,
No point in killing each other
But I feel this shit's a struggle and all
That's one of the main reasons I'm not fucking with y'all
But I still love you niggas,
And that's on the hood
And all the homies locked up
Ready to die
But really
They'll never stop us
Unless they knock us

// 102 //

I want the life of a legend
Black heart and matching weapons
Got a thing for aesthetics
Straight shooter like Redick
We get to dukin' and that Gloc-32
Pull a Laettner at the buzzer
You a dead motherfucker
Hunt heads motherfucker
My momma told me I'm living crazy
I'm just being what she made me
Dealing with the luck she gave me
Money comes and money goes
The money's low, We run in homes
Only leave the garden gnomes
Take the racks from out the stove
Stunting ain't no habit
If I want, I grab it
Selling tablet's like Toshiba, Nigga
In my city, We the killa's
If you pull that trigger, Better squeeze it nigga
If you don't
Then we 'gon have to find your house, And fucking Christmas tree it nigga
Light it up
Cops roll up
Hide the drugs
I never been to prison, And I never plan on showing up
Never could be rich enough
Cause I grew up broke as fuck
So I'll never stop my stroll
X by the O
All for the love of dough

[Hook x2:]
Until I get my 97
Benz, I'm selling dope
So get a quote
The trap is open, Nigga
Everything's a go
I'd be lying if I told you that we got it on the low
But we got it out the 'do
If you need it let me know

What you nigga's know about
40's out?
Run up in somebody house
If they home, Then swing that chrome
Knock his baby momma out
Fuck what you be talking 'bout
We really bring these chopper's out
Like Fox 11
Harmful weapons
Tell your girlfriend
Call the Reverend
Tell that pussy nigga talking
Only leave his momma grieving
Never been to prom, So he can slow dance with this Desert Eagle
Understand my grind is crooked
TK with an SK
Load off one mag
In your car dash
Like an Armean with a sextape
Nigga, I'm Heem
I'm Heem
My wave green, Like Tulane
See more drugs than 2 Chainz
Talk more shit, Than two Ye's
Hall of fame shooter
Wig scuffing, Six buffing
And my threat is a promise
I ain't one bit bluffing
I'm in one big room filled with abused substance
Sell, Recieved, Paid, Then Pon De Replay
Never seen D-Day
Watch that 16 Spray
Leave 16 dead, Buried on the east (Camouflage Hummer Radio)

[Hook x2]

// Versace Rap //

I asked my mama what's the key to life, she told me she ain't know
She just try to take it day to day, and pray I make it home
Made me wonder for a second, til I felt my weapon
Falling out my pocket, then walked inside my room before she saw it
Never had a happy home, stability's a problem
Evictions from apartments, prison letters from my father
All a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray
I probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival
My teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine
Doing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets
Gave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance
Never asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand
The day my grandfather died, I grew into a man
Around the same time I first pulled a trigger
I prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care
As long as a nigga still here, right?

Never had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white
Same color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life
Sentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it
Why the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright
Knew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong
Till I heard Chef call himself God in the song
And it all made sense, cus we can't do shit
But look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong
You fix your own problems, tame your own conscience
All that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense
Not denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options
Cus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton
I prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him
Invest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them
And won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day
Hope that choir pew bulletproof or you gon' pay

Money was the motive, Florence, California, cutting corners
Trying catch a nigga slipping just to blaze him that Sabonis (what?)
Chamber long as Tommy Chambers nigga meet your maker
As-Salamu leave em lakeside, bells can't save em
When them shells start raining, guess my mama didn't raise me right
Too busy paying Christ to wash away her sins
But I'm the only one that's fucked up in the end?
That's the shit that happens when you put a book before your kids
The only girl I ever loved turned into a bitch
If I ever see her and I got a gun, she getting hit
That's as honest as it gets, I've done a lot of shit
I ain't proud of, but I wouldn't trade it in for Heaven
11 Mac-11's, and a Tre 57, bet that shit will get to talking
If you ever got a question
Never met a person worth trying to impress
So consider this a murder when it's 5 inside your chest

// Phat Wemin //

[Hook - Kilo Kish:]
Old School Cadillac With the Tint
If Iâm At Top, Tell The Fat Woman Strip
Premium Vodka, Weed, and Girls
And any other rap shit things you've heard

I treat you faggots like I'm Tim Hardaway
God got my Nextely, hit me if he gotta pray
What these so called dues that I gotta pay?
Old niggas scared cause the new niggas got the Ks beat
Key Nyata made, caught the body, caught the case
Big poppa pump, pop the trunk, blow a cop away
They soft as Petey Pablo helicopter blades
Choppin blades, like I'm pimping Chad
'97 slab(s), Saab 9000, color of Spinelli hat
Straight out the deli with that big Mac 11
And it's for the beef shreddin'. John Lennon of my fucking trap
Can you roger that, Roger Mayweather hands hard
Hitting when I go to bat, you niggas notice that

[Hook]

Never fuck with niggas who can point out where your momma live
The shooters, cause 9 times out of 10, you lose her
That murder ain't a thing, got the Shawnn Kemp Ruger
At the trap off Hoopa, fully loaded when I shoot it
Feel that loud hadouken ho, real trill, you should know
Since my days at optimal academy
Picture like Maddux with a magnum in the black Ford Galaxy
I hope he rages, ain't no point in dodging when I grab the 3
Shoot the 3, Reggie Miller 93, 31, 32
Harold Miner quick release, run and shoot
So if I was you, I would try and pay attention
Niggas trying to catch a buzz, I'm just trying to catch you slipping

// Hostile //

When shit get's hostile, Hoes get blasted
Bodies in the morgue getting shelved like Pac Div
Tell my girl I'm running late
Stuck in drug traffic by the ten
Two ten's in the Wagoneer
Nigga picture me rolling
All my bitches is stolen
So I mean it when I say that hoes hot as a stove top
Chrome Glock and the gold, D-Block Chain
That I won from J Hood in a pick-up game
Feeling like I'm Reggie Lewis
Shit I'll probably die a shooter vic
Run my mouth a lot
Run up in a niggas house to shop
Treating bitches like it's Camelot
Feed them out the trough
Asher Roth, Disappearing white's
Slanging half the price
Never that
You see my nigga's way ahead of that
Zordon, Big headed
Strong arm
Bench Press them
Been through hell and back, So my heart's been tested
Ain't willing to die, Your heart's in question
Nigga

// SOB //

Just riding around in a convertible Corolla
Waiting for the light to change, hopefully my luck will change
Went to sleep pissed off, woke up broke as fuck again
Being mediocre is some shit I'll never understand
Never had a 9 to 5, never did an application
And rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you
"Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets"
What the fuck I look like, nigga? For real
It's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but
How in the hell could you fault me for that when
It takes money to be shit and we never seen it
So I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it
Standing on the edge of a tall cliff
Trying not to fall deep into the shark pit
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
Can't wait to see my life change once the money came

[Hook - Mike G:]
Niggas only come around when the money's 'round
Catch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down
Wasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now
These mothafuckas know they like my style
Tryna figure out, What the hell they want from me
Why I love everything that involves money?
Hope I get enough just tryna live it up
Shit I want yours too, you should give it up

She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?
Just another disappointment in my fucking day
Slave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change
But I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's
Swear that I would change everything if my gun could stay
Said she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say
Problems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed
Cause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much
But if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?
Or even have the decency to listen up? Probably not
I swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop
Can't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops
But for now I just stare you down in the parking lot
From a far distance, just hoping, just wishing
That maybe you might not think I'm crazy
I know you probably wish for the same thing but fuck it

[Hook]

// Aintnofun //

(Speak!)
Well, it ain't no fun if the homies can't run
Train on a dame that they met up at Chili's
She need good dick, so I make her pop a wheelie
Wristwatch T-Bos, diamonds chilly
Silly bitch, fuck you and your TLC
Go and fetch me a sandwich, a BLT
No lettuce or tomato, but double on the bacon
After that, collect your shit, you need to get to shaking
Silly bitch
Ugh, I wouldn't call myself a chauvinist
You just a dumb slut who can't accept my openness
Hopeless romantic and such
You trying to get me stiffer than a mannequin touch
Manic depressive, obsessive compulsive
And it's hard to stay focused with your legs wide open
And I'm sorry that I'm easily distracted
But I got a thing for southern girls with them accents
Yep, I tend to think with the wrong head
So don't get mad if I end up in the wrong bed
Next to, a perfect pair of tits
With a glass of OJ and some Eggs Benedict
Over easy, sleazy, and you don't believe me
When it's 9am and I say that I'm drinking
Cause I really got a problem
And as my father said on his deathbed
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day
And weed

// Swiss Army //

[Mike G:]
YMCMB, haha, alright

My patience wears thin with lacks of violence
Put the world on my shoulders I play it like violins
And sense, I really make none in present tense, I
Really write my lyrics in hieroglyphics, I
Really fight my lyrics can not be condensed
And the best will never feel the need to convince
My Army's offence exceeds any resistance
Be nice bitch, I just might let you meet Vince
The lights switch, so brakes are something I don't need
My reign roams, I'm Constantine with gold teeth
I play ours, realer than the words that speak in same songs
And I own every day of the week, I go hard
There's no telling where time goes
But my slow-mo flows put the world on hold
I roll like snowball effects, just watch me grow
I'm Jack Frost, I'm so cold my shadow glows

// Dreams Turn //

[SK La'flare:]
SK
Vince Staples
Speak
Eat my flesh flesh my flesh

[SK La'flare:]
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
It started with my bitch, mistress and her family
Whole town mad at me, but fuck it, I am glad to be
Killer, nothing realer in this world than a tragedy
Before I take her soul, I take her ears like Tyson
Cut my main bitch with my glove
I love to ball, I never liked them hoes
I couldn't trust them, so I hunt them base, molest they eyelids
Stalk their dreams and predict their every move like a psychic

Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties

// Taxi //

She was more beautiful than anything Iâve ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it
I wasnât perfect, na I never been
So tell me why the hell was you expecting that?
Bitchin' and complaining seems to me like you perfected that
If I wouldâve knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not
Now Iâm in this Cadillac
Please donât panic pretty lady
I wonât do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love
The one you hug
The one you kiss
Itâs funny cuz; ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost
So Iâm not downing you
Really though, Iâm happy that you found a dude
But anyway
Is the rope a little tight?
It seems as if your wrist are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesnât constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
Thatâs why I got you in the back seat, love taxi
Thatâs why I got you in the back seat

No
Donât you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Donât leave me
Alone

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at the shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got off to such a sloppy start
And what seems worst a slit throat, or a tarnished heart?
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain will last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my lifeâs a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force yet you chose to yield
So we crashed, face first blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life is nothing that last
Fast-forward to this fucked up position Iâm in
Contemplating why to live, when Iâm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me, wasnât meant to go to heaven
We was meant to be alone, die, hanging from the ceiling
Tried praying for forgiveness but God told me to shut up
