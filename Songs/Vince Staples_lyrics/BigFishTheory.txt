// Crabs In A Bucket //

[Vince Staples:]
Crabs in a bucket

Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see what the bottom, don'tcha love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encores
Sendin' shots but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, give 'em some drugs to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that then [?] turned artist
Get with that or get in the moshpit
Where's your moxie, in truth from Poppy
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Run a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
Them feelin' funny, guarantee gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put him in the bag
Prolly gonna regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They donât never want to see the black man eat
Nails in a black man's hands and feet
Put 'em on a cross or you put 'em on a chain
Lines be the same, he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
Had a show on stage like a DVD
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with
I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit

[Kilo Kish:]
Remember that I still got you
I still got you here
I swear that they come and got you
Hidden in my head
Tryna vanish
I forgot to care
And you can try [?] baby
Now it's under there
Never even crossed my mind to think
Maybe you'd have flashed a glance at me
I never really crossed your mind
I never really crossed your mind
I never really had no chance to breathe

// Big Fish //

[Juicy J:]
You can get anything you want
Know what I'm saying?
You want that over there?
You want that over there?
I got you

I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

[Vince Staples:]
I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona I was round that corner
Still down I'm a norf norf soldier
G slide right down sawyer
When we slide you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam god damn
Bag back let me make my bands got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click clack clap
Or the boop bop bam cuz

[Juicy J:]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

[Vince Staples:]
It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

[Juicy J:]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

// Alyssa Interlude //

Sometimes you have to get all the... all the crap out the way before you hit the good stuff and you're like "OK, I'm getting good stuff now"
But, um, uh, I had a bi- I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about?
I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy- uh, my ex-boyfriend, George
Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start
You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong
And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like...
And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love
You know what I mean? We were together, so-
When it- and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it- when it didn't come together, I was just like...
You know? It really hurt
But I needed enough distance from it
So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore
But not enough distance that I'd forget
I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess
I guess if you give me some material...

Raindrops on my windowsill
Longing for your nature's feel
Loved that song when we were kids
Now it makes me want you here
Sometimes, people disappear
Think that was my biggest fear
I should have protected you
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room
I know to you

// Love Can Be... //

[Damon Albarn:]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be disheartening, darling
Love can be

[Kilo Kish:]
Love can be a loss or maybe not
You can give me all the cash you got
Slap me, take the keys, go round the block
Make some memories and die [?]
I'm over you
You talk a lot of shit, unamused
Ain't puttin' on the ritz
I could finish you like I fit in shoes
So you know my name
I'm not your babe
What's that you're saying?
I don't speak lame
You know my name
I'm not your babe
Thinking of coming?
Kindly refrain

[Vince Staples:]
Wannabes buzzing
Girls love the lifestyle
So prone to clubbing
Come alive when the night's out
Just crashed the sports car
So much for fast life
Phone calls from loves lost
Tryna get back right

[Ray J:]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be so disheartening, darling
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be

[Vince Staples:]
Tell the world I want my OGs
Dodge the groupies, them don't move me
Uchies moved me somewhere cozy
Uchies never leave me lonely
Call my phone, say she horny, want me
I can make time or I can make money
I'ma keep countin', count me out, shawty
Never let a bitch Lil Bow Wow me
Never finna weaken, raise my seat
Baby mama drama on the TMZ
Alimony money for the nails and weave
Nail me to the cross like that boy JC
Chuckin' up the deuce like the boy Chris Breeze
But we don't Su Woo on the six-five street
Riding down the shoreline, tank on E
No shotgun seat, this dick ain't free

[Vince Staples (Damon Albarn):]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be (disheartening, darling)
Love can be
Love can be
[Damon Albarn:]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be disheartening, darling
Love can be
Love can be

// 745 //

I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"
745
745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"
745

All my life man I want fast cars, NASCARs
All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss
All my life I want waves at my front door
No green grass, no porch
I just want sea shores
All my life
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
Told me lies, told me lies

I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

Eyes can't hide your hate for me
Maybe it was made for the Maybelline
Spend so much tryna park the car
Barely got a tip for the maÃ®tre d'
You head straight to the oyster bar
I tread light each time I speak
Play too rough might break ya heart
And them glass shoes ain't made to walk
These lonely streets
Unpaved, unscathed
Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
Said that she was comin' through after dark
Look at the stars, they hardly speak
This thing called love is real hard for me
This thing called love is a God to me
And we all just got property
So feel free to fulfill the prophecy

Adam, Eve
Apple tree
Watch out for the snakes baby
Open streets
Ocean breeze
We should get away, baby

I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

// Ramona Park Is Yankee Stadium //

New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
Gunshot

// Yeah Right //

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah)

Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the club right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right

Pretty women wanna slit the wrist
Pretty women wanna be a rich man's bitch
Pretty women want a couple kids
Pretty women want a new ass, new lips
Pretty women wanna push a Benz
Come correct and she won't let you in
Thumbin' through the checks, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

Got an enemy that changes dependin' what direction
You're facin'
Got an enemy that tells you off, blockin' what's efficient
You're placed in
You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle
You're chasin'
Keep pretendin' that you real
Until every selfie is erased

Pop 'til it's fakin'
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, corrallin' the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
A sad nigga? Yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' though my last four kills for the highlights
My life, high life, high five, bye, bye

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

// Homage //

No stupid
Don't think too much, you gon' lose it
Just lose yourself in the music
Get off your ass and move that thang, girl
All my girls are my main girl
'Round the world in them planes
'Til they chains too strap to do range
'Til they see how you walk and your strange look

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

Oh my God, I'm the bigshot now
Prima Donna had them like "wow!"
Hitchcock in my modern day
Where the fuck is my VMA?
Where the fuck is my Grammy?
Supermodels wearin' no panties
Supercar, not drivin' no Camry
Freshman [?] but no rallies

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

My girlfriend looks like she's from Gilmore
Dance on my dick like we from Fillmore
This my ghetto story, crescendo
Coupe with them same windows, limos
Wrong label had me in limbo
Too much info, we're rich and prismo
Prolly loco, black as the Congo
Pay me pronto, wearin' snow camo

I'm on a new level
I am too cultured and too ghetto
If you knew better you'd do better
But then you would know by the word of my penis
Please do not treat me like I'm not a genius
I'm runnin' on empty, the new River Phoenix
I'm out in Bristol, bro from the ends got a pistol
The bro from the ends gonna get you

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

[Kilo Kish:]
I was 'pose to meet you
Don't tell my girls or I'll creep through
I never see you
Can't figure what I did to leave you
Everything's see-through
Your official smile to see you
They can see you
Wish that I could see too

// SAMO //

Way up, way up
Way up, way up

SAMO thing
Watch me do the same old thing
If I wrote your ass a love song, could I make it bang?
If I pull up with my guns drawn, run, I make it bang
Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang
Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank
Never blow it on chains, rather blow my fuckin' brain
Decorator came from Spain, blow the budget on an accent couch
What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin'
Daddy in and out of prison, ain't no father to my style
I'm the ODB of the OPB
When I go OT, all the shows sold out
And the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama
Tryna break a player pockets, that's a no no
This day forward, I ain't takin' photos
Then we wear our old clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo'

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Win the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate
I'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G
I traffic 'cross the interstate
We cracked and launched the murder rate
They know who did the killin', but they didn't see
Want a verse? This the price. Want a show? This the fee
We don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy
Empty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin'
I gotta take this extra five
No doubt in mind, we the best alive
No testifyin', we silent
Never told on my partners
My partner and 'em got bodies
I'm tryna put 'em in robbers
They used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college
Put 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Way up, way up
Way up, way up

// Party People //

Yeah I been fucked since my early days
I been stuck in my worldly ways
Propaganda, press pan the camera
Please don't look at me in my face
Everybody might see my pain
Off the rail, might off myself
Bored with life as I board this plane
Stewardess asked if I need help
Maybe baby, what's your last name
Hopefully it still ain't been changed
Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya
I wuss out as my brain scream louder
Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself
Couple problems my cash can't help
Human issues, too strong for tissues
Fuck bravado, won't mask my wealth

Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

Deja vu from a bayside view
I see black cats in the daytime too
I see black cats on the daytime news
With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue
I made out once at the rendezvous and felt star-struck
"Vince, the car's out front"
Got things to do, got to make my moves
I can't miss my flight and miss you too, boo
First class seats is overrated
Won't go 'less they overpay us
Nowadays I'm overdatin'
My dick is strict for procreation
Her lips, my lips stay well acquainted
Her morning moans is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

// BagBak //

This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin is black as midnight
I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz
I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven, as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you think it's different
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

Boy I'm buoyant, we are
Floating on them peons
Go in 'til they take my bro'nem out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So 'til they love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in

Gas break 'n dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Better bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me
Bagbak, better back, back, you don't know me, homie

They found it
Depth close to 3,230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range

Clap your hands if the police ever profiled
You ain't gotta worry, don't be scary 'cause we on now
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
We on now

// Rain Come Down //

You don't know, know, know, know, know, know

[Vince Staples:]
I'm the man, ten toes in the street
I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose in the Sphinx
Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on the side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Ride in the drop top, so I think
Might get JFK'd up, if not I prayeth
I\If so, no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre day off
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Louisville Brown on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete

[Vince Staples:]
Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need the fire
On prison time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Cover Girl, but her chest flat
Toothpaste spread in the CLR
Or, I think it was for Wayne
Can't remember springing for it, bring it on the plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Call Ca-lal-lane
She getting naked undercover's for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain, in the club
Don't you dream on how it feel to be in love?
What you drunk? You need a bus?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
