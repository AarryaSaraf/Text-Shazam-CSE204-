Album: HellCanWait

// Fire //

School couldn't get me into Heaven
And Heaven couldn't get me in a bitch bed
Bred 11's that I stole on a house lick
Got them hoes, whole Polo outfits
Feelin' like Young Dro, summertime '06
Thirteen years old runnin' my home, ya bitch
Believe that, we was thuggin' on the back street
Catchin' cases, probably finna go to Hell anyway

[Hook 2x:]
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway

Them Yankee hats remind me of my younger days
Dog was a maniac
My momma had me where them babies havin' babies at
My knuckles ashy knockin' niggas on they ass
For smackin', never lackin', road to riches is a path
Mothafucka watch your ass
And quick race, dawg, for when cold blood like Crips
You dig your own grave when you fuckin' with the Lord
Catch a fade, probably finna go to Hell anyway

[Hook 2x]

// 65 Hunnid //

[Hook:]
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby get on your knees (Baby girl get on your knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

Runnin' to get to that check, I'm comin'
Jumpin' out of that back seat bustin'
Buss buss missions with the blower as a youngin'
Back when Killa Mo
Had 'em coppin' Crystal through the prison door
Feel the 4, when I'm feelin' low
Time to stretch a nigga
Ridin' through your section
Shit, I hope you got protection with you
Hop out when the cops out
Shit, I'm cold with my .45, brown rag, green light
Yoda time

[Hook]

You alone
Car full of niggas but you alone
It's time to show how much you love your homies
One nigga outside, two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop
Don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before
That niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knockin' then
Problem is lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missin' from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enrolled in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hittin' glass
Get the money long
Gleamin' with the tints and the stash, no tags
Bumpin' poison on the ave
Gettin' cash until a nigga's gone
And ain't shit wrong with the truth, got the Juice
Would've threw that nigga Bishop off the roof

[Hook]

// Screen Door //

What's the word, what's the word, what's the word?
You are now about to witness the strength of narcotics

[Hook 2x:]
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?

Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie, bro
Pop's was off that O.E trippin' gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold D's, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C-Notes
Up on the screen, Dolce in the pack it up and leave
But we don't read those
Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie let me proceed
Pop's was moving slow poke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4p.m. he leave so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad or was he chilling in the alleyway
He was in the alleyway, that's what he always had me say
Slangin' for them bills he had to pay somebody at the door

[Hook 2x]

Pots on top of the furnace, Glocks on top of the kitchen
Table-tables is turning, now my father is trippin'
He shootin', sniffin', and sippin', pigs recruitin' them snitches
Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knockin' at my door, pretendin' nobody hear him
Police knockin' down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we livin', hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison dogs are sniffin' backyard full of canes
Catch a case and not get out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slangin' rude, we bangin' too
Where you from?
If they got that back, we clapping coming through
Going dumb, 40's selling water profit from the slums
Since we was young money been the motive
Nigga get you some guns and dough
Bruh I love them guns and dough
Find me slangin' for the low
Come around, you getting domed, somebody at the door

[Hook]

// Hands Up //

North Division tryin' to stop my blackness
I'm watchin' for them badges when out in traffic
Them 9-11's been a tad bit frantic
If lights start flashin', please don't panic
The DEA givin' out gang enhancements
Can barely even hang to build a case off cameras
CCAT trackin' criminal patterns
Trickin' niggas into takin' strikes to get out faster
Freedom bribery nigga, cause we hardly acquit
Social media that leave the flash photography snitchin'
Blame geography nigga, for the pride in these niggas
Take you when they fingerprint you, now you part of the system
This was all a part of Huey P. and Bobby prediction
Makin' profit off of violence, they arousin' attention
Leaders risin' lead to twenty-five to life in the prison
Better watch it cause I know they got a spot for you nigga

[Hook 2X:]
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air

Deangelo Lopez and Tyler Woods
Just a couple they gunned down around the hood
I guess the pigs split wigs for the greater good
Cause I ain't seen them lock a swine up yet
At the most they reassign 'em to prevent protest
Just your color is enough to get you under arrest
Strong hand to the law got me feelin' oppressed
If you flippin', kill a fifty, then you get in a chair
Payin' taxes for some fuckin' clowns to ride around
Whoopin' niggas asses, scared to man up
Handcuffs givin' niggas gashes on the wrist
I used to lift my fist to fight the power with
Older homie told me in his day the pigs was plantin' bricks
In the trunks of nigga's Chevrolets them traffic stops and shit
Raidin' homes without a warrant
Shoot him first without a warning
And they expect respect and non-violence
I refuse the right to be silent

[Hook 2X]

LBPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LAPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LASD, no they ain't 'bout shit
Ridin' 'round these streets givin' out full clips
[X2]

[Hook 2X]

// Blue Suede //

[Hook:]
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this
Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us
Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof
Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy
Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios

[Hook]

Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that
Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac
Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's
Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife
Finna party like it's prom tonight
Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his momâs tonight
Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden
Nigga, fuck that

[Hook]

All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em

// Limos //

[Hook - Teyana Taylor:]
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you better

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

[Bridge:]
So you love and you lose it
She don't wanna devolve
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost

[Hook 2 - Teyana Taylor:]
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better

He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw
Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog
How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague
Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else
The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it
Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here
Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is
Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself
Scared of the future, runnin' from the past
Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass
Young, dumb in the brave heart, numb from the pain
Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways

[Bridge]

[Hook 2 x2]

// Feelin' The Love //

I wake up tryin' to dodge the cops just like my momma did
Came home from school soon as I seen she was up out the crib
Criminal Minded, mind your business if you wanna live
Them niggas fiendin' for them luxuries they'll never get
I took a couple women's love for me and hit a lick
If she can't help me get up out the struggle, why I need the bitch?
I need a million dollars for starters, been sick of sleepin' on the couch
In this crowded apartment, them streets been in a fuckin' drought
I don't see the narcotics, it ain't no books up in this backpack
I brought the revolver, I'm asking niggas where the cash at
Tappin' they pockets
That pocket rocket make a backpacker as soon as you blockin'
You know the block is hot
Wayne tried to tell them, one case away from felon
Granny told me stay inside the house, a nigga should've listened
Been punchin' out their faces with the hands that I pray with
Money trees blowin' in the wind, I'm feeling the fragrance

[Hook:]
Is you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love
Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done
Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done
And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come
Yeah I'm feeling the love [8x]

2006 I said I had to get my money right
Shit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night
Might put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind
Then run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine
College was a plan of mine until I seen them fees
Everything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets
Only price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me
Closely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie
Goals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep
Mom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave
Then this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds
Is what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?
Played a lot of roles in life but never played the victim
Never paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights
Mac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist
Life is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice

[Hook]
