// I Don't Believe You've Met My Baby //

Last night, my tears they were fallin'
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strollin' in the evenin'
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinkin' about you
And then you met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talkin' to

I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
Cause I was still wonderin' who
Your arm was restin' on her shoulder
You smiled at her, she smiled at you
Her eyes were filled with victory
She said my brother wants to marry
And then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me

Oh, I don't believe you've met my baby
You looked at her, you looked at me
I knew that you would marry me
I don't believe you've met my baby

// Down From Dover //

I know this dress I'm wearing doesn't hide the secret I have tried concealing
When he left he promised me that he'd be back by the time it was revealing
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow o'er the fields of clover
And time is running out for me I wish that he would hurry down from Dover

He's been gone so long when he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass and now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself 'cause waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give it if he doesn't hurry down from Dover

My folks weren't understanding when they found out they sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out he'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool and she did not believe it when I told her
That everything would be all right 'cause soon he would be coming down from Dover

I loved him more than anything and I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved and I just can't believe that he was using me
He couldn't leave me here like this I know it can't be so it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this so long, oh he'll be coming down from Dover

My body aches the time is here it's lonely in this place where I'm lyin'
Our baby has been born but something's wrong it's much too still I hear no cryin'
I guess in some strange way she knew she'd never have a father's arms to hold her
And dying was her way of telling me he wasn't coming down from Dover
