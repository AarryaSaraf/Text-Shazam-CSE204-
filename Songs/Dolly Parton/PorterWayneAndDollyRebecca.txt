// Forty Miles From Poplar Bluff //

I've never had a pair of shoes that weren't all hand-me-downs
And daddy's morning coffee came from ol' left over ground
My mama wore no jewelry or any storebought stuff
And home was on a hillside forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Our only family treasure was a beatup radio
But it took us to the places where we knew we'd never go
We never had much money but we always had enough
Cause money never mattered much forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Well, nearly every winter when the snow is on the ground
And the roads would all be closed and we couldn't get to town
But if daddy had his tabaccer grandma had her snuff
Then the winters didn't seem so long forty miles from Poplar Bluff

Forty miles back in Missouri there's a different way of life
Where a man thinks of his neighbor and not his neighbor's wife
Life is far from fancy sometimes mighty rough
But contentment makes it worth it forty miles from Poplar Bluff
Forty miles from Poplar Bluff

// Just Someone I Used To Know //

There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just someone I used to know

Just someone I used to spend some time with
Just a flame that's lost its glow
But I don't tell them of the nights I cried without you
I say just someone I used to know

Just someone I used to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I used to know
I say just someone I used to know

// Each Season Changes You //

Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you

It was springtime when I found you like the flowers
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun
In the fall I could see our love was changing
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done

Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you

Came the spring again you said that you were sorry
And the summer brought a golden memory
In the fall I saw your love was changing
And the winter brought the same old misery

Like the weather your heart changes with each season
Springtime summer fall and winter too
Though I know I'll never understand the reason
I still wonder why each season changes you

// We Can't Let This Happen To Us //

Lately we're acting as if we were strangers
For a moment with each other we don't take time
With our work and busy schedules of things we think important
Seems we've left the most important things behind

And we can't let this happen to us
The hills that we climb may seem rough
And the mountains between could shadow our dreams
And we can't let this happen to us

We can't let this happen to us
We must cherish each smile and tender touch
For the castles we've built could all crumble to dust
And we can't let this happen to us
No we can't let this happen to us

// Mendy Never Sleeps //

Mendy is sixteen and uncontrollable Mendy is only a child
Mendy is in with the in-crowd Mendy is ever so wild
Mendy's hair hangs straight and long Mendy feels this is a must
Mini skirts and many friends and many horrors for us

Mendy finds a plenty to do but Mendy never sleeps
Mendy slips out of the house in the evening when the sun is sinking
Mendy is out with the in-crowd Mendy is smoking and drinking
There's a different shine in Mendy's eyes
And the color is gone from her cheeks
Mendy is a swinger but Mendy never sleeps

Mendy never sleeps and Mendy is growing weak
Mendy lies lifeless and limpid are her eyes
Now oh Mendy, please, don't go to sleep

// Silver Sandals //

In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds

So many times we let our thoughts turn back to yesterday
To a little girl that could only watch the children as they played
She walks with us in memories we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds

The grave in which she sleeps is cold but our thoughts of her are warm
And we cry as we both long to hold her in our arms
Each night in dreams we see her running to us smiling sweet
With silver sandals on her little feet

In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds

She had asked for sandals from the time that she could talk
And it would break our hearts when she'd ask us why she couldn't walk
She'd say when I go to heaven can I change my crutches then
For a pair of silver sandals at the rainbow's end

In silver sandals she goes walking up those golden stairs
And though we miss her so we know she's happy to be there
She walks with us in memory we see her all the time
In silver sandals walking through our minds
In silver sandals walking through our minds

// No Love Left //

There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left

The feeling we felt for each other
For a long time now has been dying
We'd both be better off without each other
We can't bring it back to life why do we keep trying

There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left

When love is gone it's gone and you can't bring it back
When the warm sun goes down it turns cold
We both might as well just accept the fact
There's nothing warm left for us to hold

There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left
There's no love left our love's beyond help
Why do we keep on tryin' when there's no love left

// It Might As Well Be Me //

I'm lookin' for a way to get out
There's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along
Everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me

We stopped loving a long time ago
And now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend
There's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me

There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me

// I'm Wasting Your Time (And You're Wasting Mine) //

There's nothing left to tie us to each other anymore
The love we knew is gone and that's a fact we can't ignore
There's nothing left to lose ends on all the ties that bind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine

There's no use in wasting the good years that we have left
When we might find happiness with somebody else
There's no chance for us we can see it we're not blind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine

The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine

The blame belongs to both of us I guess we didn't try
Love is like a garden without care we let it die
The flower of love can't bloom if the sun don't ever shine
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine

Though it hurts we know we must leave it all behind
I'm wasting your time and you're wasting mine
You're wasting mine you're wasting mine
