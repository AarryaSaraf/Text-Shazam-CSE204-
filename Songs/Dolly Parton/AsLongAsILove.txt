// Why, Why, Why //

Why why why did you say goodbye
Why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home

I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy

What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home

I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy

// I Wound Easy //

You're late again tonight and I know the reason why
You're out with someone else while I sit home and cry
But I'll just wait right here for you cause I know your new love won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast
This isn't the first time your heart has gone a'stray
You have no resistance when temptation comes your way
But I'll forgive you this time like I've always done in the past
I wound easy but I heal fast

You know that I love you more than anything
And you know that I'll forgive you for causing me this pain
Oh, tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast

Yes tonight my heart is breaking but I know this hurt won't last
I wound easy but I heal fast

// I Don't Want You Around Me Anymore //

You think you're so smart you think that you'd throw my heart
Don't at your feet every time that you walk by
But I, I got news for you cause I don't care for you and
I don't care honey if you love me or not
If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore

Because you can't have your way you tell me every day
I should grow up stop acting like a child
But I, I think its you that's got some growing to do
And honey I think its gonna take you quite a while

If you were half as smart as you think you are
The world would be a-standing at your door
But I, I won't be there cause I no longer care and
I don't want you around me anymore

// Hillbilly Willy //

Now Little Will was from the hills way back in the sticks
He got his reputation from turning on them country chicks
He drove a souped up hot rod car buddy he could really
Knock those little girls off their feet yeah
Hillbilly Willy
He'd talk that ole sweet lovers talk with a hillbilly drawl
Willy wasn't much for looks he was only five feet tall
But when he talked that ole sweet talk he drove those little girls silly
They stood in line waiting for their time to court
Hillbilly Willy

Then this country cyclops who measured six foot nine
Came up to Little Will and said, "You stole that little girl of mine"
Then there was a awful brawl boy it was a dilly
When the fighting stopped there on top stood
Hillbilly Willy

Now the moral of the story is to be a lover you gotta be tough
Even if you're just five feet tall you gotta be able to strut your stuff
Now to all you lovers in radioland, if your love life's a little chilly
Bear in mind the rough, tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy

Just bear in mind the rough, tough kind like
Hillbilly Willy

// This Boy Has Been Hurt //

I saw him picking up the pieces of his broken heart
And so I stopped to see what I could do
His heart had been run over by a reckless lover
She ran over it and broke it and left it black and blue
Tears were scattered everywhere he was trying to save his pride
He was the victim of a love and run
And I could plainly see that she had almost killed him
Left the scene of a broken heart not looking back at what she'd done

Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his heart and mend it if I can
Oh, this boy has been hurt, I'll save him
I'll take his tears and dry them as fast as he can cry them
I'll heal his hurt and make him as good as new again

// Daddy Won't Be Home Anymore //

As I look around the little house we were so happy in
I think of all the happy times we'll never see again
Then I break down and start to cry, the children ask what for
I can't find a way to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore
Each night before they go to sleep they fold their little hands
And say a prayer for Daddy fighting in their far-off land
So tonight I'll help them say their prayers like I've always done before
God give me courage to tell them that Daddy won't be home anymore

But honey as for me there'll never be another man
And I'll bring our children up the best way that I can
You died for what you thought was right that much I know for sure
But the children just can't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore

No the children just don't understand why Daddy won't be home anymore

// As Long As I Love //

Hurt is no stranger to me
And oh how well I know misery
You've always hurt me
But I always forgive
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply
I'd give you my love completely
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live

For as long as I love you, there'll be pain
Though tears come and go
My love remains the same
I'll always forgive you
You know that I will
And I hurt for as long as I love you
And I'll love you for as long as I live

Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you
And I'll love you for as long as I live

// A Habit I Can't Break //

Loving you isn't good for me
You keep my tears flowing
If I left you I couldn't stay gone
So there's no use in going
Loving you is a habit I can't break

I haven't found a way yet
But I've been trying
To stop loving you but I can't wait
There's no use in lyin'

Loving you is a habit I can't break

Loving you is a habit I can't break
I've been loving you much too long now
To change the way I feel
So I might as well get used to these heartaches

Loving you is a habit I can't break

// I'm Not Worth The Tears //

Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes
And daddy once was able to hold his head up high
But now I brought disgrace to my whole family
Now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on
So in my hurt and bitterness
I let myself go alone
But all I did was hurt myself
And shame my family
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me

No I'm not worth
The salt in one tiny tear
Oh why have I brought shame
To the one I loved so dear
I'm so sorry that I hurt them
But they'll never know how sorry
And now they cry but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me
Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth
The tears they cry for me

// I Don't Trust Me Around You //

You're standing much too close to me again
I'd never once touched you
But in my mind I've already sinned
You're making it hard for me to be true
I don't trust me around you

Seems like every place I go I see you there
I can't keep my eyes off you
I just stand and stare
You tempt me more than anyone I ever knew

I don't trust me around you

I don't trust me around you
I belong to someone else
Not once have I been untrue
But when I'm close to you this way I find myself wanting to

I don't trust me around you

// I Couldn't Wait Forever //

I couldn't wait forever
Did you expect me to
I guess you thought I'd never
Find somebody new
I lived on dreams and promises
As long as I could
I couldn't wait forever
The way you thought I would
The lonely nights grew longer
As I prayed for time to fly
I lived on hopes that you'd return
And that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness
Just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever
Needing love so desperately

So I found new lips to kiss me
New arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness
To fill these empty nights
You took my love for granted
Now my heart has found a new home
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long
I couldn't wait forever
Forever's just too long

// Too Lonely Too Long //

No matter how you're tempted
Don't say yes to me
Don't make this night as smooth to lead me on
It's just that I'm so lonely and I need someone
I've been too lonely too long
Oh please be strong enough to refuse me
Before I let myself do something wrong
For down inside I'm not that kind of woman
I've been too lonely too long

Oh please don't take advantage of the situation
For I'm afraid that I'm too weak to resist temptation
When you're used to being loved
It's hard to live alone
I've been too lonely too long
I've been too lonely too long
