// Two Sides To Every Story //

Two sides to every story we can't stay this out if we'll take time
Two sides to every story you tell yours and I tell mine

Well where were you last night when I came home
When I came in you were out and gone
Well I waited up till up to two then I went downtown to look for you
So how's about tellin' me where you were at
Well me and the boys stopped off for a drink or two
(Now ain't you a pretty thing)
Well we got to drinkin' and I guess that time just flew
Well the time must've flown for you alright
Cause I thought you're gonna stay out all night
And I told myself I ain't a puttin' up to that

There's always two sides to every story...

You said you went downtown to look for me
Did you have to dress up fancy as could be
You know I never leave the house you know jacky clothes lookin' like slut
And I's downtown just to look in my best for you
Now I'm not accusin' you of doin' wrong
But that's awful late for you to be out and gone
Now look who's talkin' bout bein' late and I wasn't about to sit and wait
Why you were at that when with no tellin' who

There's always two sides to every story...
There's always two sides to every story...

// Jeannie's Afraid Of The Dark //

Her two little feet would come running into
Our bedroom almost every night
Her soft little face would be wet from her tears
And her little heart pounding with fright
She'd hold out her arms, then she'd climb in beside us
In her small voice, we'd hear her remark
"Mommie and Daddy, can I sleep here with you
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark"
One day in the summer, we took some flowers
To place on some old family graves
Jeannie said, "Mommy, ain't it dark in the ground
Oh, Daddy, I'd be so afraid"
Then she looked up at her daddy and me
And said somethin' that broke both our hearts
She said, "When I die, please don't bury me
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark"

Jeannie was always afraid of the dark
And we never could understand why
'Cause we looked after Jeannie with the very best of care
Because Jeannie was our only child
Perhaps it was death that she was so afraid of
'Cause it took her one dark stormy night
I think we always knew that we'd never see Jeannie grown
'Cause it seemed she was destined to die
But on Jeannie's grave, we placed an eternal flame
That glows and never loses its spark
And on the darkest night, there's always a light
'Cause Jeannie's afraid of the dark

Our Jeannie's afraid of the dark

// Run That By Me One More Time //

Run that by me one more time
To make sure that I heard you right
I hope you don't expect me to believe that line
I might be crazy, but I ain't dumb
And I know a lie when I hear one
Would you run that by me one more time?
Well, you're late again, I see
What's your excuse this time?
Don't you try to kiss and make up
When you smell so strong from wine

Well, I'm not late, the clock is wrong
You need to wind Big Ben
Honey, that's not wine you smell
That's aftershave for men

Would you run that by me one more time?

What happened to the money
I gave you to pay the rent?
The rent is overdue
And we ain't got one red cent

I put it in the cookie jar
The day you brought it home
One day when I came back from town
I looked and I'll be dogged if that money wasn't gone!

Would you run that by me one more time?

// Wabash Cannon Ball //

It's good to be back home again at the Sevier Tennessee
I'm awful glad to see you hope you're glad to see me
Now I'd like to say I love you I welcome to you all
Now I know I stole this steam from the Wabash Cannonball

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
Up the hills and down the mountains and the valleys to the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and known quite well by all
She's a mighty famous thing called the Wabash Cannonball (Pete Drake)

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
That's that train from Tennessee boys she's long and she's tall
She's a famous choo-choo train called the Wabash Cannonball (yodel)

// You Gotta Be My Baby //

Oh you said you were my baby
Now I know that you're my baby
But it seems to be you got roamin' eyes
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You can't keep your finger in two different lives
I remember how you pleaded
When my love you said you needed
And I believe without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And keep those kissin' cousins out

Oh you know how when I said I was a'rollin' low?
I get suspicious and I'm a'gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine

Just think about it

Now I heard there was another
So I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around besides me
She gave me no satisfaction
And now I can't take no action
But I think I'll hang around and see

If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You gotta come to me and tell me so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
I'm tired of waitin' around so let them know

Oh how when I said that I'm a Rollin low
I'm gunna get suspicious and I'm gunna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine

I said and be nobody's baby but mine

And I mean it!

// Tall Man //

Oh I wish I was a kissin' tree a growin' in the ground
And every time my sweet pass by I'd throw some kisses down
And if he wants more kisses here's all he has to do
Just come up here that kissin' tree and I'll give him some kissin' to
I love a tall man he ain't a small man my man is all man and the only man for me
Now I wish I was a kissin' tree out on the lone prairie
And everytime my sweet pass by he'd steal a kiss from me
And if he wants more kisses here's all he has to know
Just plant me down in a Texas town and watch them kisses grow
I love a tall man he ain't a small man my man is all man and the only man for me
And the only one for me ooh

// Medley: Dumb Blonde / Something Fishy / Put It Off Until Tomorrow //

I'd like to do the first hit record that I had
And it's a song that goes like this

Don't try to cry your way out of this
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you
Just because I'm blonde, don't think I'm dumb
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool
You've hurt me enough today

Oh, thank you
Thank you so much
I'd like to do a little medley now
Some songs that I've wrote and recorded
And had, different country artist to record
I hope maybe that you might enjoy 'em
Here's one that goes like this, called "Something Fishy"

I think there's something fishy going on
There's something fishy going on
From these fishing trips you're going on
Now I'm sick and tired of staying home alone
Some night when you come home you'll discover that I'm gone
And you can bet there's something fishy going on
Thank you
Thank you so much, you're all finesse

I'd like to do a song that my Uncle Bill owns
That I was telling you about a little earlier, "Hit me right"
And it goes like this

Put it off until tomorrow, woah, woah
You've hurt me enough today
You say, our love is over
And that you have found another
Now you say you're going away
Oh but leave me tomorrow, woah, woah
You've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today
I can't believe the word you say
But I must accept the fact
You won't be coming back
Oh, stay, stay just one more day
Loneliness, isn't fun all way

Put it off until tomorrow, woah, woah
You've hurt me enough today
Thank you
Thank you, thank you so much

// Y'All Come //

When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you and they'll never ever leave you
Y'all come to see us bye and bye
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then

Now Grandma's a-wishing you'd come out the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
Then they all start a-leaving, and though she's a-grieving
You can still hear grandma say

Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then

Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us when you can
Y'all come (y'all come), y'all come (y'all come)
Oh, you all come to see us now and then

// Bloody Bones //

This is a story that I wrote
And I know that all around Sevierville
And around in the mountains, people have big families
And it's kinda hard to get them into bed at night
So, I guess I'll love you for me with bloody bones and scratch eyes
And the Boogerman, right? (Yeah, I heard)

But I like to do a song now that, not a song
I'd like to tell my little story and it goes like this
And I'll dedicate this to my mama
Even though she meant well, she done this to us
Now there was 12 of us kids
And all day long we'd fight and we'd scratch
And we'd scratch and we'd fight
But mama never had any trouble getting all of us into bed at night
'Cause dear old mama, bless her heart
She done the best she could
But mama had the awfulest way of making us be good
She'd tell us that raw head bloody bone was waiting just outside
That he'd come in and get us, if he knew I was crying
And he'd scare us all to death if the dogs outside get to barking, woo
There where times we hear daddy cough, we'd think it's bloody bone harken
Oh me

And when we got up to something mean, well mama she smelled the rat
She'd scratch on the wall and she'd say, "Lisa, what was that?"
Then we'd all get scared, and we'd dive underneath the cover
And we'd make us a little airhole and stick our nose out
Just enough so we wouldn't smother
And every night, one of the kids would wet in the bed
But mama, she never did understand why
But I wasn't about to get out of bed and take a change

I wasn't about to get out of bed and take a change
And step on, bone old scratch eye, oh me

Well, I'll get in the bed, you see
And I'll cover up my head and I put my fingers in my ears
So I couldn't hear the Boogerman that was breathing under the bed
'Cause I know if I get out of that bed that the devil would get me by the hard hand, oh me!

And now that we'd sleep four and five in the bed
And we get scared we'd all screecher
And it be below zero in our old house
But we'd just be burn up

And when we did drift off to sleep
We'd just lay there, and we'd glut and we'd moan
'Cause we was dreaming 'bout that bloody bones
And that scratch eyes and that Boogerman
There was a beast in us in our home, you see
And now that's been a long, long time ago
And now that I'm grown
You know, I still ain't sure that there's not a Boogerman
And a scratch eyes and a raw head bloody bone
Thank you
