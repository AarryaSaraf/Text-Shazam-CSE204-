// Possum Holler //

As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler

As a young man I'd go a courtin'
With my sweetheart so young and fair
Down the mountain to Possum Holler
That's where he'd always find me waitin' there

Now I tell my mama that I's goin' out walking
Neath the moonlight so bright and fair
And I'd tell daddy I was huntin' possum
And take off a grinnin' and a slickin' down my hair

As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler

Then one evening in Possum Holler
My sweetheart's daddy stopped all our fun
Yeah, we got married in Possum Holler
Just you and me my daddy and daddy's gun

As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler

Now when they see a possum hunter
Young and handsome and a smellin' fair
We just lean back and bust our laughin'
'Cause we know there ain't no possum there

As time goes by the tales grow taller
About possum in Possum Holler

// Is It Real? //

You came into my life at a time when I was down
And I thought I'd never love again but I think different now
You took my hand and helped me up and I thank you for your precious love
And words cannot express the way I feel but is it real

Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real

Well, you could mend my broken heart with love as sweet as yours
And I want to believe it's real but how can I be sure
And you could heal the hurt I've known with the love that you have shown
And all the needs you have I will fulfill but is it real

Is it real this love that you have offered me so freely
You tell me that you love me but darling do you really
Don't make me love and lose again don't make me go through that again
I've known that hurt and I know how it feels oh is it real
Is it real?

// The Flame //

I find myself remembering things I thought I'd forgot
I thought I'd gotten over you but I can see I've not
And seeing you has made me realize how wrong I've been
And the torch I've carried for so long is burning bright again

The flame is burning bright again it just took my seeing you to know
That the flame had not burned out it just had flickered low
Yes, I still love you just as much as I ever did before
The flame is burning bright again and I can't fight it anymore

Could it be your seeing me has set your heart on fire
Could it be old memories has filled you with desire
Oh, if after all this time you find that you still feel the same
Then come and take my hand and walk with me into the flame

The flame is burning bright again it just took my seeing you to know
That the flame had not burned out it just had flickered low
Yes, I still love you just as much as I ever did before
The flame is burning bright again and I can't fight it anymore

// The Fighting Kind //

You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind

Oh yes, you did you started it like you start all our fights
No, I didn't do no such thing and let that a dirty lie
Nothin's ever your fault and nothin's ever mine
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind

Well, you've burned the supper up again that's nothing new
I just figured you'd pack that all on me
Well, you're the one that caused it oh it's always me
When you're always lookin' faults ain't hard to find
We delight in pickin' fights cause our love's the fightin' kind

Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything do we blame it on the other
Some love is understanding and there's careless love in line
It takes all sorts and mine and yours is known as the fightin' kind

Okay Miss Priss what is it now now I know you done this
What how am I supposed to shave that ain't never been my problem
Now I don't care about you using my razor
But did you have to use my brand new blade
New blade boy it's good that is really good
That's real good to think I went to all that trouble tryin' to fix that nice for you
That's fixed up nice I'll probably keep it for washin' the soap off the wall
Oh, there ain't no soap or I ain't got no television in the bathroom
And that new blade that you begrudged me had already been used

Two lovers both too stubborn
To take the blame for anything so we blame it on the other
What's mine is yours what's yours is yours and so on down the line
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind
You and me cannot agree cause our love's the fightin' kind

// Two Of A Kind //

I thought I'd been in love before but so did you
I thought that I would love no more but so did you
We'll always be together, forever yours forever mine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

There's so much between you and me
Like sadness and disappointments, jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

I'd made promises to you that I couldn't keep
And you know I've said things to you that I didn't mean
We made our vows and we can never break the ties that bind
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

There's so much between you and me
Like sadness and disappointments, jealousy
Like respect and honor and admiration and a love so fine
You and me, you and me are two of a kind

// All I Need Is You //

Find the loneliest girl in a thousand
Find the saddest eyes you've ever seen
Find someone who's always longing for you
Find that man and you found me

And all I need is you, all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you

Find a man who wakes up every morning
And lives in a world of make believe
Find someone who's arms are aching for you
You find that girl and you found me

And all I need is you, all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you

You're with me now so let the world forsake us
I've found my heaven here within your arms
And nothing in this world can separate us
You're all I ever wanted all along

And all I need is you, all I want is you
To give my loving to all I need is you

// Curse Of The Wild Weed Flower //

Their thoughts are all mingled their dreams all confused
Their minds and their bodies how they abuse
Searching for answers that doesn't grow there
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower

Their plans their desires and all of their hopes
Wither and die as they go up in smoke
Sharp as a needle and filled with despair
Such is the curse of the wild weed flower

From a moment of joy to a lifetime of sorrow
For one day of pleasure they trade their tomorrows
Lost in a garden where bulbs all grow
With blossoms of heartaches and petals of woe

Eyes full of emptiness just stand and stare
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower
Bound by the curse of the wild weed flower

// Today, Tomorrow And Forever //

Today tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
I'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever

We've got the kind of love most people dream about
We're sure of our love in our mind there's no doubt
And I know that you love me by the things you do and say
And our love keeps growing stronger day after day

Today tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
I'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever

Each day you let me know just how much you care
And you know if you need me you know I'm always there
You don't have to say you love me over and over again
I know because you show me and I know our love won't end

Today tomorrow and forever that's how long our love will last
I'll never stop loving you no never today tomorrow and forever

// There'll Be Love //

There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love

God created man and woman at the start
And he placed inside of them a lovin' heart
But it wasn't God that made the hate and lust
But as long as there's two people there'll be love

There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love

For every person somewhere there's a mate
It's the force for survival that brings hate
For even though the going might be rough
As long as there's two people there'll be love

You can lock a man behind a prison wall
And you may think that he has no love at all
But there's someone somewhere that he's thinking of
For as long as there's two people there'll be love

There'll be love love love, oh precious love
Just as long as there's two people there'll be love
In spite of hate that fills the land, love will always have command
As long as there's two people there'll be love
