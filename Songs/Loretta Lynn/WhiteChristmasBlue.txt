// Country Christmas //

Mommie pop the popcorn and we string it on the tree
Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel
Daddy play the organ and we'll all sing Silent Night
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
[ guitar ]
Aunt Annie Belle will be here uncle Bill and darn our kids
We'll make ballets on the floor just like we always did
Gradnama bake the pies and cakes oh what a pretty sight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas...
A good old country Christmas...

// Away In A Manger //

Away in a manger no crib for a bed the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
[ vibes ]
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes but little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love our Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh
[ vibes ]
Away in a manger no crib for a bed...

// Blue Christmas //

I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[ piano ]
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue heartaches start calling
You'll be doing all right...
