// Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town //

Oh you better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm a tellin' you why Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's a makin' a list he's a checkin' in twice gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin' he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake
Oh you better watch out...
[ guitar ]
Oh you better watch out...
He's a makin' a list he's a checkin' in twice...
Santa Claus is a comin' to town

// Silver Bells //

Silver bells silver bells it's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring soon it will be Christmas Day

City sidewalks busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing people passing meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear
Silver bells silver bells...
(Silver bells) silver bells (silver bells) silver bells soon it will be Christmas Day
