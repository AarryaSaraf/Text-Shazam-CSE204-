// Three Hearts In A Tangle //

Three hearts in a tangle
And one heart will have to break
Three hearts in a tangle
What will be the loser's fate

One heart, I'm tied to
And the other heart
Our love is true
Either way I go
I'll bring sorrow, yeah, and
One heart will be broken in two

If I had to choose
Either one of these hearts
Then the other heart
I'll surely break

And if I ever leave
I will suffer, yeah
And who's heart will
Pay for my mistake

Now I sit by my window
I'm watching the people
Go dancing by and I'm
I'm trying to reach a decision
And I'm afraid I won't do what's right

I want you to sing
A little bit louder
...

You gave me love, a joy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
Oh yes I am

Oh oh, oh oh, I...

Oh, I cry, and I cry
And oh, I can't be satisfied like a baby
Oh yes I am

Oh yes I am

Oh oh, oh oh, I...

I'm just like a baby
Just like a baby
Just like a baby
