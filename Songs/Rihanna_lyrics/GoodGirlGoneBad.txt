Album: GoodGirlGoneBad

// Umbrella //

Uh-huh, uh-huh (Yeah, Rihanna)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Good Girl Gone Bad)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Take three, action)
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
JayâRain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come here to me
Come into me
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
You can always come into me
Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain
Come here to me
Come into me
It's pouring rain
It's pouring rain

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

Push up on me

I know many guys just like you, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing

You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)
Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me out of my dress, oh

You're making staying over here impossible

I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night (Uh-huh)

// Shut Up And Drive //

I've been looking for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night

'Cause I'm zero to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)

Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?

Baby, you got the keys

Now shut up and drive
(Drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive

'Cause your Maybach ain't got what I got (get it get it)
Don't stop it's a sure shot
And your Ferrari huh boy I'm sorry
I ain't even worried
So step inside and ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride)

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for

// Hate That I Love You //

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (Yeah)
That's how much I need you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (That I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Oh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (Oh)

You completely know the power that you have (Power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (Makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... (I)
Love you beyond the reason why (Why)
And it just ain't right, oh

And I hate how much I love you, girl (Ooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (Yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go (Ooh)
But I hate that I love you so

One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me (Hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how much I love you
How much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you

I need you
And I hate that I love you so

(I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (Yeah)
But I just can't let you go
(But I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so (Ooh)
And I hate that I love you so, so

Something's on ya mind

It's about ya secrecy
So what are you tryna hide?

You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door

Blow your secret open wide

Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently (Uh)

// Sell Me Candy //

Sell me candy like it's summer when it's melting in my hands
I know you're around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I'm weak by your touch and when it's melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you're knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shorty that you're rocking is nothing like me
You're selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (You know)

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

I wanna play, more than you know
So don't you leave, and don't you go
I want it all, until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It's destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What's the charge? What's the cost?
(I'm the daddy) You the boss

// Rehab //

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door (Let you enter my door)
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it (Do it)
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed (Using like I bleed)

It's like I checked into rehab (Oh)
Baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab (Oh)
'Cause baby, you're my disease (You're my disease)
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease

Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, now gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

// Question Existing //

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Ha ha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

// Good Girl Gone Bad //

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (Don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone, oh

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We done forever

We gone forever
We gone forever

// Cry //

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry

How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken-hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry (Cry, cry, cry)

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life (You'll never see me cry)
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart

But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my life

// Haunted //

Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh

Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave (Oh, no)
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
(There ain't nothing I could do about it) No, no

I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted (Haunted), haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walking out that door
Haunted, haunted, ooh

// Take A Bow //

Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Ooh, whoa, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

(Oh-oh)
Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? (Ooh, oh)

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not (Mm)
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
But now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (Goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

// If I Never See Your Face Again //

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn, you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else, far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath, on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It's hard not to give in

I'm lost, I can't tell
Where you end and I begin

It makes you burn to learn
I'm with another man

I wonder if he's half
The lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else, far away
I don't know if I will find you (find you, find you)
But you feel my breath, on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby
Please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind
(Promise not to leave me behind)

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before

If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

Keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before (Did before)
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
