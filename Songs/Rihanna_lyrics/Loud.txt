Na-na-na-na, come on

Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
Na-na-na-na

Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na)
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na)
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

S-S-S and M-M-M
S-S-S and M-M-M

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong

And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na)
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Yeah, you know, word of mouth

'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh
Good weed, white wine, uh
I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio
Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl
Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say

Oh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?

// Fading //

You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Drifting, settling
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah

Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Ta-ta, so long

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night

Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

// California King Bed //

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed 
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

// Man Down //

Sak pasÃ©!

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

It's a twenty-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ay-uh

'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (Would you hear me now?)
In Central Station

Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
Whatever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Eh
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Mi say wah man down
A weh mi say
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
When mi went downtown
'Cause now I am criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord, oh mercy, now I am a criminal
Man down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out of town, none a them can see mi now, see mi now

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big old crowd
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station

Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye-bye
Set your standards lower boy you're aiming too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better, so good-bye

And he sweating me just 'cause I got the tightest hole

I ain't tripping on your money, money long long long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me Celie
Anyway Ri-Ri, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie? Really? Really?
No for real, really?
Laid down on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
'Cause it's raining men
Fat bitches

Ladies don't worry 'cause they got plenty more
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh it's raining men girl what you worry 'bout?

I said hey, outta my way, where my ladies
Riding big, living good, doing big things
Dancing, don't pay
Player keep the money I can buy my own drink
Up in the club, see men coming
Dime a dozen so it don't mean nothing to me
And I ain't even worried about you, homie
'Cause there's plenty more fish in the sea, OK

Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

// Love The Way You Lie Part II //

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
