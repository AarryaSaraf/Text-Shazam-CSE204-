Rest your weary souls on my shores, yeah
Sand and the sun and the tropical breeze, yeah
You can get away from the sharks in the seas, yeah

Wild out, make a name

If crib pop-itty, I don't need more hoes
See no evil even if she won't go
Dijon chico with the neon coat
Got a vision of the sun, I just see more gold and

Wild out, make a name
Stars is out, freaky time
Sink the ship, take a dip
Coconut, take a sip
Wildfire, dance around
Wear my gold like a crown
Where we've been, given doubt

// Candy //

I can name a couple ways, baby, this shit might go
You just might forget that this was what you're gettin' high for
Men that like to do the things to remain that guy who
Need someone who's sweet and not gon' shoot to make that high note

And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

I can be your sugar when you're fiendin' for that sweet spot
Put me in your mouth, baby, and eat it 'til your teeth rot
I can be your cherry, apple, pecan, or your key lime
Baby I got everything and so much more than she's got

And it's such a typical thing
Runnin' over billion men who
Only deal with difficult things
You gon' need a billion hands, ooh

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy (Candy), she's so sweet (She's so sweet)
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

Sugar-coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper
Sugar-coated, lies unfolded, you still lick the wrapper
It's addictive, you know this, but you still lick the wrapper

She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real cherry, know that it ain't real cherry
She's just like candy, she's so sweet
But you know that it ain't real, know that it ain't real

// Game //

Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you
Is it bad if I care for you?
You make it seem like it is a crime that I love you

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before

It seems so official
Boy I waited, waited, dodgin' players just to get you
They been sayin' things, just instigators, while I kept you
This shit seem automatic, I have, I ain't into

You don't really want me now
You know there's always someone else
You did it to me like you've played this game

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before
You did it to me like you've played this game before

Yah, throw hands in the air
Swear I can't bring that ass anywhere
You don't wanna fling, bring that ass over here
Boy, feelin' like a contest, how you wanna stare
Your attention span prolly long as your hair, too
If you're true, why you gotta dare, boo?
Some win and some gotta lose
You really need love, two L's, no cool
It is not me, nor them, just you
Acting like a fiend and the perp gon' shoot
Act seventeen when you're thirty-two
Pussy too clean and it purty too
So I can't intervene on your escapades
'Cause I ain't really tryna be the next to pay
And be the next to say, "I got an ex today"
I can see it in your eyes when you flex your games and shit (Yeah)

I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before
I did the most, I gave my all
You did it to me like you've played this game before

// Casual //

Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is
Take it off, follow me now
Let me in, don't shut me out
Don't tell me you love me if
That's not how it really is

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

You don't need to paint me a sweet fantasy
We chill, I kick back, you roll up my weed
Say what you feel, don't just say anything
Why complicate what could be so easy?
Leave me alone
If you is a player I don't think I'ma play with you, uh huh
This shit get old
If you wanna lay with her, why don't you just stay with her?

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight
Stand and fight for me

I'm sick of chillin', sippin' on Tecate
That life is a bore, we needed more than drunken Fridays
I'm not dissin' your freedom I know you like to party
Just don't be that boy who fuck with anything that gyrate
I know you know I'm right
Pick up on the vibe
If you read between the lines
Being shy just ain't my style, now

You say you don't want a girlfriend
But when we are in person
You always act so different
You make it all seem perfect
You hold me when we wake up
Say you like me with no make up
I'm trying to be patient
How am I supposed to take it?

If you wanna be the one, don't act sad and wait
And waste my day, I'm not that way

Is it casual
Or are you tryna spend your life with me?
I don't mean to pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight for me
Is it casual
Spend your life with me?
Pressure you
But I want a man to stand and fight

I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in on freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh

No games, no way, JosÃ©
Foreplay, don't fake both ways
Like Olay, and I won't chase to it, OJ
Soul based, and I'm on face like I'm Colgate
Hallways when I go all day, get it (Uh-huh)
Now it's the one to throw it back with it
Fittin' all that, he ain't gotta call back
Trippin' this, prison this, nigga I don't get it, I'm addicted
Reading all my feelings, need a one-way ticket
Looking so fly 'cause I mind my business
Self-proposed but you know I'm vicious
Slow your roll, you can't lie to me, baby
I see it all in your eyes and your face
Want these knees to go opposite ways
And I see you fiendin', go off on it, babe
I don't need to speak, I'm not talkin', babe

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

You're coming on to me
And I can read it all up on your face
Control it, get your way
Baby, you can't hide from me
Come and vibe with me
Boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me
And boy, it ain't my fault, it's building up inside of me
I hope I can get you out before you say goodbye to me

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

Good self control but you stickin' it out
A figure of mouth, don't wonder why you twistin' your loud
She twerkin' it out and wonder why they thirstier now
Every night dodgin' broke niggas, curvin' 'em out
Like every pipe got its own feelings lurkin' below
I mean, really? Do you love me? Is it certain, for sure?
I got money, nigga, know you gon' be hurt if I don't
But I got niggas in my city and my bitches is cold, so

Tell me what you had in mind
Watch it closely, we'll unwind
Psychology of the mind
You do your job, I'll do mine
'Cause the body doesn't lie

'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?
'Cause you're talkin' with your body, body
Can we touch up on that topic, topic?

I think I need something new, something you got for me
I'm the one to give it to, to get into, I'm ready
I'ma get comfortable
'Cause you know I won't be here all week
And we both got it in on freak
We ain't afraid of sexuality, oh

Still workin' on my wine, need a back rub

First night, wreckin' this suite, no pack up
Tuck me like money in a mattress
But we ain't finna sleep on a mattress
Practice, knee-deep in your tactic
Back it up, beep beep, no U-Haul
Tossed salad, no cheese, no croutons
Said it don't taste cheap, no coupon
No drugs, just me's that you's on
Five star, that's sweet, no futon
