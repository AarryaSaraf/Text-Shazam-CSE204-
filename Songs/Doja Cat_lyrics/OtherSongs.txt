// 4 Morant (Better Luck Next Time) //

The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are- of chicks
And they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I'd flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection, stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I'm weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I'm the 'shine once guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, "Mother never weep"
My brother finds blood
I say, "Shut up 'fore she sees"
Another motherfucking treat
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spittin' natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense"
You're testing the masters
So guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles
Someone hexed all the bottles
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

Better luck next time
Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Next time)
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Better luck next time)
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-be-be-beâ

Then zoom, zoom, get out the fast lane
Boom, boom, that's why my ass ate
Bow, bow, love it mi back-weight
Uh, uh, give her the ashtray
She don't want smoke, bitch, whip out the band-aids
Don't get cut, catch a bitch on the bad dates

Animal crackers goin' in y'all soup

// Boss Bitch //

Mmm
I ain't tryna (Ah)
I ain't tryna
I ain't tryna

Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't
I chew, chew, chew, 'cause they hope I choke

I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss

Said bitch, I'm the after, you been the before
I been the stallion, you been the seahorse
Don't need a report, don't need a press run
All of my bad pics been all my best ones
I wear the hat and I wear the pants
I am advanced, so I get advance
And I do my dance and cancel the plans
Said boo, don't be mad 'cause you had the chance

Drop, said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it
Said I took it and I ran for it
I won it, then I stand on it
Money on the floor when we dance on it
Shine bright, let them put a tan on it like

I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss
I'm a bitch, I'm a boss
I'm a bitch and a boss, I'ma shine like gloss

Oh, make me over

A walking fire
You can't get rid of me

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, so glad you could make it now

My name is "Never Was"
My name's forgotten

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

When I wake up in my makeup
It's too early for that dress
Wilted and faded somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh
No second billing 'cause you're a star now
Cinderella, they aren't trash like you
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?

You better watch out
What you wish for
Better be worth it
So much to die for

Hey, so glad you could make it
Yeah, now you really made it
Hey, there's only us left now

When I wake up in my makeup
Have you ever felt so used up as this?
It's all so sugarless, useless waitress
Model, actress, oh, just go nameless
Honeysuckle, she's full of poison
She obliterated everything she kissed
And now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh

You want a part of me?
Well, I'm not selling cheap
No, I'm not selling cheap

Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Give me your bundles of rubber
Enough wit' the rambling, get under my covers
Enough for the fam and I bundle my numbers
I crumble my bread
Come up with hundreds
I'm losing my head
Keeping the bread
Even the cheese and the reefer in reach
Keeping it iller then feverish fiends
Keeping it clean, sike
Speak of the evil and me
I'm sorta like demons and queens
I got all these people in me
Sorry my alternate ego is speakin'
People unbreathe when I get mean
Eat my fajita or get out my team
Lick up a swisher and lean
Like Evil Knievel
I beat the grime reaper
Ignite like a fever

I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

Eat it like a cannibal
I'm not from your planet, ho
I ain't the quick fix, I'm the antidote
I get kicks out of trix but I banish hoes
Like the Hannibal
Bitches wanna bite
No mandible
Like an animal
Imbalance is in my chemicals
Get calluses from the pencil grip
Asking Alice if this is wonderland
Like Erika I don't understand
I don't understand, bitch
Twisted in the mind
I don't think that we're in Kansas
So this is what the plan is

Like a cannibal
Just like a cannibal
Like a cannibal

'Cause I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm- like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
Like a cannibal
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
Fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene
I'm fiending to eat up the scene

Got a nigga like this my belt

Have you screaming like oh my Lord
But she don't need help

Until she wanna talk back, talk back, talk back
Curse words, big hand, loud slap
When I come home, was good oh snap

Yo got me blushing man right from the back
Ain't no cursing, I swear you an ass
Freak ass nigga I swear you a track
Yall need that nigga I swear you a dad
Yo when I got him aching, he ain't taking
He gone give this ass a spanking
Don't care how high my ranking

See how the fuck I'm out here dancing

You caught me

I feel like I popped in the sky
Get in my space, ha, you'll catch a rocket and ride
I spy (I spy) with my little eye a target
You mine, all of this mine
All of the shit that I buy, all of the bitches that cry
See 'em from up on the stage, see 'em from up in this cage
See 'em look down on me then I look down on they ways

See what we get with that mind set
Now what's priceless?
When it's nice lenses on my iris
Need a high check for that white jet to my island
Why she gotta swag like a light bitch?
Why she gotta brag like a tight bitch?
Why she gotta act like a white bitch?
Cause I don't respond to your hype shit?
I think that you niggas might like this
Like, is the world for me?
Do you ever feel like that?
Like life is surreal but you gotta keep it real like that
Sometimes you gotta split real fast
Turn down these niggas that they heels go clack, clack, click, clack
He ain't had an ass, this, bad
Only if you bad then you more like Cat
We just stack we don't fold our cash
Doja you ain't a British bitch

Five shots, ready to party, throwin' it back, it's principle
Throwin' it back like fishing pole, throwin' it back like fishing pole
All of your junk like physical
That's just how we do it, not a rhyme or a reason
We signing broads in the front while you look off in the bleachers
We pullin' up the way we do to keep the audience tweetin'
The farther we goin' up, it's like the harder they reachin'
If you see my titties, I tell 'em record it and keep it
A couple twins sittin' pretty, no Victoria Secret (Yeah, c'mon)

I beat my face
Movin' fast 'cause the Uber on the way
Takin' pictures, make sure you can't see no lace
That wig secure like the money in a safe
I look like bae
Now I'm on the way
Let you know when I'm 'bout a mile away
When I'm outside, please don't make me wait
The party startin' when we pull up to the gate
Girl, we so late

Classy like Chloe and Halle, nasty like Megan
Losing me, you drop the queen like blackjack in Vegas (Latto)

Ooh, ooh

Sick in love and baby, you're my doctor
Talk to me, don't be scared to go a lil' more deep
Tell you everything like you're my doctor

Yah, yah

Take one of these, twice, morning and night
And if I'm still walking you ain't tore it up right

Give me life, please kill my pain
Numb this feeling in my veins
Boy prescribe me, I can't wait
Hypnotize me in every way

You can't really beat her
Follow me and I'll lead ya
(Don't do anything)

Who you better than?
We go farther than Neverland
Taking off and I never land

Pop the pussy like metal cans
Fur coat and I'm shedding man
Ha, steez
'Cause I see the light
Give you what you need tonight
We don't fuck with leave behinds
Simple plans, we just lead behind
Don't make me count to six, give you "kitten's" timeouts and shit
Keep your weapon and mouth your bitch
Run for it, now my mouth is sick
Tell me "Doja, that hurts no fair"
See my team we just circle squares
Bad bitches with purple hair, with attitudes that no man could bear
Uh oh, look at what the Cat dragged in
Keep them rats out my cat mansion
Fuck all your opinions, I don't give them atten-ti-on
Lights out at the benihana, sugar fish and that sushi roll
Cool ya chick, keep ya Uzi home

Double cup, po' it in
Sweat it out and then sew it in
Beamer Benz and polish friends
Yoo, but mirror who is the coldest bitch?
Mirror who be the coldest bitch?

// Golden //

How the fuck you live so golden?
How you make your mouth and your wrist all frozen?
No handlebars but my hits so Hogan
Pockets make the thou when I'm feeling so bloated
Click, bang, pow, now your speakers are loaded
New JCs, I can't wait to put my toes in
Posin' and all them little niggas start jonesin'
We might have something in common 'cause I admit I'm focused
I've been riding through The Hills like Heidi
Twerkin' on his suit like Miley

Niggas in the kitchen with that white, doing bumps
I don't need that in my life I do not like that stuff

So I pick up where I left off, yes, I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write their own bars

Preference is in Pluto, where I sight see all the stars

// I Don't Do Drugs (Y2K Remix) //

Love got me fucked up

You don't really hit me back
'Cause I feel like I'm attached
Shoulda never kissed you back
Ever since I fell in love
Not quite like bein' trapped
More like a sickness that
Keeps me addicted bad

Hard for me to let you go (Let you go, let you go)
My body wouldn't let me hide it (Hide it)
No matter what, I wouldn't fold (Wouldn't fold, wouldn't fold)
Ridin' through the thunder, lightnin'

(And I)
Forgive me, I brought it upon myself
(And I)
Needed a fix of you, not just one kiss from you
I needed more

Love got me fucked up
Got me on stuck, chasin' that rush
Had to give in, couldn't give up
I just want you, but I don't do drugs

Still I want you, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (All I want is my baby)

All on my tongue, I want it

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I like to say, "What if?" , but if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, uh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, uh-oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la

Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
No but in all seriousness, I'm the best rapper alive

You could be the back then and I'll be the now
High as Neverland I'm Peter Pan, we'll keep it down
I got ya wig and ya man and ya nosey
That should be enough to keep a clown on her toseys
Look, Reddit, I gets my credit
I fleek my brows and I lay my edges
Keep my crowd and I pay my dues
Blood red bottoms, you da lady in the shoe
We pop the bottles while you getting all the booze
Every day I brush another nigga like rouge
I'll take the L that the chicken had to ooze
I ooze when they look at my boobs
Look at my ass
Look at my crew
Look at yourself now
Look at your goons
Look at all the views that I got on one tune now
Tell me who the queen and who making all the rules
Rock to my shit
Flock to my shit
This is my flow, putting a lock on my shit
Fuck all of the games, but I'ma bottle my shit
You never could step, hop walk to my shit
Big joint shit like it make big coin
Give a bitch a red dot, sharper than a pin point
Bring bacon back home like a big oink
Gold digger
Chewing out your pocket, that's a bit coin

Seems like you need some juice
All y'all should ween off pills
Somebody needs some chill
(Somebody needs some milk, hahaha)
Make hits, I drop it simple
My boys got white like dental
Your rhymes, you bought like rental
I don't make pop like pimple

She need milk
He need milk
Y'all need milk
Y'all need milk
He need milk
She need milk
He need milk
Need some milk
I don't make pop, I, nah
I don't make pop, I don't

// Niggas Ain't Shit //

Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit

Um, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause

Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (Your cousin)
Logical thinkin' is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fuckin' mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fuckin' job

Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib

We were playing the Powerpuff Girls and Buttercup was a monster and I played the Mayor and Blossom was Ms. Bellum
Then Buttercup wanted to pretend she was Blossom, but Blossom wanted to be Blossom, and I wanted to be Bubbles, but they told me I couldn't
And no one wants to be me!

You ain't team if you ain't popping like this
Bet you dream 'bout being popping like this
It's a shame you ain't popping like this

This don't come natural
Workin' hard on a 9-5 shift
Everyday's just another celebration
All you fakes need get how I live (huh)

Thank goodness, I found you!
Are you okay?
Did you stop the giant ant?
What's the matter? Why don't you say anything?
Oh, I get it! You're too cool to talk to a dork like me, right?

Coloring, coloring, coloring
Grab another color, doo dee doo!

Tell 'em kick rocks if they're training for a team
And if the sun don't rise
I raise my Tiffany's eye
Baby, I'm feeling just like I'm picking a lie
Gotta be tripping to get me sleeping at night
Baby, you can't shine like me
Swimming in the 24K
Caught winning in the party, aye
Once you get it you don't want no other way
No other way

Gal, your pockets looking famished
Pack a lunch before you pass out

If your diamonds sound like drool
You need to get a better jeweler

// Say So (Remix) //

[Nicki Minaj:]
Yeah, you know it
Mhm, this the remix
Doja! Rrr

[Doja Cat:]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Uh)

[Nicki Minaj:]
Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the Rams, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Geppetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan, send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made him more a fiend
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee

[Doja Cat:]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)

And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you (Like you, like you)

Like you (Real life ways), like you (End these games though)

I might keep it simple, to find out what you're here for
Just let me know
I know I'm quiet. I don't fight it every time you leave me crying
Out to the sky. You can tell me why
Love could be alive, if your love is not a lie, whoa
