// Beautiful //

Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
See you in that powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that

Hey, Nayima, 'sup Sabrina
Hey, Naomi, love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doing too much with your dude in the sheets
N-n-n-n-now you soft like 300 count
Little rubber band tuckin' 300 thou'
Throw it on the floor, make 300 bounce
Can you make a 16 come out 300 mouths?
(I might, I might, I might just have a)
'Cause I might have a check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny I am coming for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails

As usual I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticles
And boo, you should know I'm so doable
It's quite provable that we beautiful
That we beautiful

Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
See you in that powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that

Yeah, and it ain't about being good lookin'
It's your brains, how they working
Get that good sookie-sookie
I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-lookin'
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playing hookie
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you could call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty posting all them selfies, help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head?
'Cause maybe we can intersect
'Cause sexually you interest
Boy, visually you is a yes
(No respect)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you, too focused on the booty
You bastard bachelors is really acting like you're Clooney
Y'all truly won't be players 'til you learn to see the beauty
(Male groupies)
Can't say I blame you, if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
'Cause even if you think you knew me
A woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me

Powder, set, yes
Came out impressed
Kill them in that dress, kill them in that
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful
I'm beautiful, I know it's so
I'm beautiful

// Nunchucks //

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Baby, stand up
But don't pull them pants up
You're pulling off my shirt
But should I leave my hands up?
Expression of fandom
You know that I've been good
But you still tear the cat up
And when you provoke me
You do it at random
I won't lead you on
But I hope that you can manage
You don't want to man up
You don't want to plan up

But you call me wifey
So what's the big idea?
Do I need to sit right here and fill my ears
While bullshit come out of your lips? I hear
Got me searching for insight insight
Guess I need to call this night off
Riddle me, riddle me that
Mr. Unintentional Ass
And his every interval fast
Throw that cheese and dough in that bag
With that Little Italy swag
Nigga, riddle, riddle me that
Why my mental instantly crash when you enter into me?
Gentle then ya ease up
I'm day dreaming
But now, whoa, I never daydream
But you're jumping from rooftops
And searching and hunting, my ninja
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa

With the nunchucks
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
Feeling dumbstruck
I done been there, done that
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I've been there, I've been there)
Rolling in your hood
Ask a big bad wolf "what is good?"
(I wonder why, I wonder why, I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why) I wonder why
(I wonder why) I wonder why (I wonder why)
But I wonder why I still feel so alone

Blow, weed, coke, pop X
Speedin' up the heartbeat bangin' in my chest

Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh
Whee-ooh (no police) no police

They say I bang, they never toy with me
Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk, walk, but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak, bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease
How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?
All these bars, no police (no police)

(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
All these bars, no police
(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police

He calls me copper tone, smokin' ultraviolet
We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Uh, that's nasty, but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple Xannies for me quick

Pop a couple Xannies for me
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me quick
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop)
Pop a couple Xannies for me bitch

All these bars, no police
All these bars, no police
(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police

Yeah, yellow bars, get it in
Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in
Let it take you to a place you ain't never been
Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground
This kitty's hot, fan it down
Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
Them bars put ease to your crazy past so
Baby if you need it come and get it
Just can't hold this back from you
Now pop this with me

(Whee-ooh whee-ooh, whee-ooh whee-ooh)
All these bars, no police

Pop a Xanny - freak
All these bars, no police
