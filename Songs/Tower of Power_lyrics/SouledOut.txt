Album: SouledOut

// Souled Out //

There's a place where everybody's goin to
It's the place that's the place to be
It's the scene where everybody wants to be seen
If you choose to go and get your mind right, your body will follow
What you better be there, way ahead of time, uh, or stand in line

Everybody's gonna be there
There'll be party people everywhere
'Cause one thing you know for sure
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there

Late at night the place will be bumpin
So you better bring your dancin' shoes
Cause there's gonna be some hot, funky rhythm and blues
If you choose to go and make a standing, that's not hard just follow
But there's gonna be some competition there, uh, so beware

With a little bit of soul now
With some positive emotion
And one thing you know for sure
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
It's souled out
It's souled out
It's souled out

It's souled out
Party people everywhere
It's souled out
Throw your hands up in the air
It's souled out
Player got their dancin' shoes
It's souled out
Got no time to have no blues
It's souled out
Party people everywhere
It's souled out
Throw your hands up in the air
It's souled out
If you have the [?] T.O.P.
It's souled out
Somebody, everybody, come on and say oh yeah!
It's souled out

Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out
Got to get in, everybody got to get in
It's souled out
Got to be there, everybody got to be there
It's souled out...

// Taxed To The Max //

Politicians promise all they can
To get elected, to make a better land
In a smoke filled room, they're makin' all their plans
But when the smoke gets clear, you know it's just a scam

I'm just an average ordinary kind of guy
Punchin' in at nine, punchin' out at five
Doing all I can to pay the bills on time
No matter how hard I try, I just can't get by

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Weapon systems, national defense
Vested interests, it doesn't make no sense
What we think we get, ain't always what we get
They keep raising all our taxes, but we get deeper, deeper in debt

I'm just an average ordinary kind of man
Slightly underpaid, tryin' to understand
No matter what I make it's never quite enough
I want to do my share, but it just ain't fair

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

I'm just an average ordinary kind of guy
Punchin' in at nine, punchin' out at five
Doing all I can to pay the bills on time
No matter how hard I try, I just can't get by

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

Taxed to the max, but we can't get the facts
They just tell us what they think we ought to know
(We get) taxed to the max, but we don't get it back
Someone tell me where the money really goes

// Keep Comin' Back //

I've been to heaven before
But I must have been too young to realize
I would've stayed there
If I had known about my paradise

What a time to believe
I could make it on my own
What a lesson to learn
Widen up, you're all alone

I tried to run away but I just
Keep comin' back to you
I keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do
I keep comin' back to you

There was a time in my life
When everything was all about change
I'm not ashamed to admit
There's one thing that still remains the same

All the stars pave a way
All I did was think of you
All the love that I missed
Now I know just what to do

I tried to run away
But I just keep comin' back to you
I keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you, baby, baby
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Tell me that nothin' is changed
Tell me you want me to stay
I keep comin' back
Keep comin' back

I try to runaway but I just
Keep comin' back to you
Said, I'm gonna keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

Keep comin' back to you
Keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do

// Soothe You //

Whenever something's wrong
I will be there

When the whole world is on your shoulder
And you don't know which way to turn
Even though the rain is falling down
The sun comes through the clouds
And everything will be all right

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya)
Baby I will soothe you (yeah)
I'm gonna soothe ya (soothe ya)
For ever by your side

If ever there's a problem, inside you
I'm here to listen to your heart, yeah yeah
When you see the writing on the wall
That your world's about to fall
Baby you can talk with me

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya), mm
Baby I will soothe ya, sooth ya, sooth ya (yeah)
I'm gonna soothe ya (soothe ya)
If you think you had in mind

And just keep holding on
Until I see that sparkle in your eyes, yeah yeah
Open up the door
There must be a thousand reasons why
For woman cry

I'll soothe ya

Then I see the heartbreak you embrace
Written on your face
Girl I'm gonna take them being away

I'll soothe ya (soothe ya), ooooh baby, baby, baby
(Soothe ya, well) yeah well girl
(Soothe ya) Girl I'm gonna make you feel so good
(Soothe ya)
Yeah (for ever by your side)

(Soothe ya) Come on hold and let me run somehow I'll do
It for you baby (soothe ya)
(Soothe ya) I have it here on the table oooh woow I'm
Gonna make you real good (soothe ya)
(Soothe ya) And then we woke up and did the things we
Used to do make love to you all night alone baby
(That what you had in mind)

(Soothe ya) I will, I will hold you baby. Nobody has
Ever made you feel, the way that I make you feel ooooh
(Soothe ya)

// Do You Wanna (Make Love To Me) //

Whoa whoa, baby

Most of the time you can't make up your mind
And that doesn't really bother me
But when it comes to us, indecisions a bust
I just gotta know how it will be, yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm asking from you
I just wanna know

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Or do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's take a swim, shut the door, but let me in
Do you wanna make love to me? Oh yeah
(Do you wanna?)

Bet you didn't know that you're movin' too slow
For me to know to even be amused
You've got perfect etiquette, so politically correct
But I suspect that just some what could use

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm asking from you
I just wanna know

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna make ecstasy?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's just take a chance, cultivate some true romance
Do you wanna make love to me? Oh yeah yeah
(Do you wanna?)

Girl, it's not a lot that I'm askin' from you
So make up your mind, baby
We've come much too far, there's no turnin' back
I need you tell me

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Or do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
Do you wanna make ecstasy?

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you want me to set you free?
(Do you wanna make love?)
Now's the time let's just take a chance, cultivate some true romance, yeah

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
(Do you wanna? Oh baby)
Do you wanna make love to me?

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
([Incomprehensible] do you wanna make love?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(You and me baby, yeah)

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(Come on baby we've been doing this dance a long time)

Do you wanna make love to me?
(Do you wanna?)
(Do you wanna make love to me or what?)
Do you wanna?
(We've been together so long, I'm starting to wonder)
Do you wanna make love to me?
(I'm not goin to beg you, it's now or never)

// Diggin' On James Brown //

I've been through all them changes
A lot of stuff came down
I've dealt with all the issues
You might say I've been around
But back when I got started
There was a righteous sound

It doesn't matter what I've been through
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page

Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

I had an attitude adjustment
I did some psycho therapy
I helped myself to some self-help
I dabbled in some ESP
Though my world is ever-changing
And I move from town to town

It doesn't matter where I've been to
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page

Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

You got your rap and your disco
You got your drum machine
You got your R-rated gangster
You got your grungy scene
You got your state of the art
You got your digital sound

It doesn't matter where it's going to
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

Take it to the bridge
It'll get ya where ya live
When there's water all around
You can still get outta town
And still be diggin' on James Brown

Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page

Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

// Sexy Soul //

Remember when we met?
We'd listen to the radio;
Tuned in The Stylistics
And danced out on the patio.

But now we're always busy,
We never seem to get the chance
To spend some time together
To rekindle our romance.

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.

We'd drive up on the hilltop
Just to share the crystal view,
Diggin' Gladys and Aretha,
And then we'd swear our love was true.

But something came between us,
We never seemed to find the time,
And if we don't find the answer
It will seem like such a crime.

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.

We don't want to end up like the others do,
'Cause we've got something special and we both know just what to do:

Let's stay at home,
And listen to some sexy soul.
Just the two of us, alone,
There's nowhere else I'd rather go,
Let's listen to some sexy soul.

// Once You Get A Taste //

I'll tell you something that you wanna know
I'll show you the way that it's gonna go
Here's the story, it's a natural fact
Once you get a taste there's no turning back

It don't matter everywhere you been
It doesn't even matter the shape you're in
If you do the substance just jump back, Jack
'Cause once you get a tasted there's no turning back

Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
There's no turning back

People gonna give you all that free advice
They'll tell you once, they'll tell you twice
They'll give you no peace, they'll cut you no slack
Once you get a taste there's no turning back

It always will be and it always was
People always tryin' to cop a buzz
To the center of the earth in three seconds flat
Once you get a taste there's no turning back

Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back
Oh, there's no turning back

When you caught that plane, you missed the boat
End of story, that's all she wrote
You can get on the train but be off the track
Once you get a taste there's no turning back

Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
Once you get a taste there's no turning back

Once you get a taste there's no turning back
You can be on your own or you can run with the pack
But the time will come to clean up your act
'Cause once you get a taste there's no turning back

Ooh, there's no turning back, hey
Once you get a taste
You need to know there's no turning back
Once you get a taste, once you get a taste
There's no turning back

Once you get a taste, once you get a taste
Don't you try it
