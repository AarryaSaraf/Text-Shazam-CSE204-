// The Story Of You And I //

Oh
You, you took me to the cleaners
You hung me out to dry
(You) You really couldn't have been much meaner, honey
(Oh you) didn't even have to try
You made me buy your lies
About you and I (you and I)

(I) Oh I should have seen it comin'
(Oh I) I should have played it smart
(I) Oh girl, I should have hit the pavement runnin'
(Oh I) Oh I should have seen it from the start
It ain't no big surprise about you and I (you and I)

I was fooled completely
You acted oh so sweetly
For a minute
Oh, for a minute and a half
I began to wonder
I might have made a blunder
Were you in it
In it just for laughs?

That's the story of you and I
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

You really had me spinnin'
You took me for a ride
(You) made me think I was winnin'
(Oh you) said you'd be right by my side
You made me buy your lies
About you and I (you and I)
Ain't that a shame

(I) Oh I should have seen right through you
(Oh I) I must have been so blind
(I) hey I really thought I knew you
(Oh I) I must have really lost my mind
Girl, there's no surprise
About you and I (you and I)

I was fooled completely
You acted oh so sweetly
For a minute
Oh, just for a minute and a half
I began to wonder
I might have made a blunder
Were you in it
Were you in it just for laughs?

That's the story of you and I
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I
Help me

That's the story of you and I (you and I)
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

That's the story of you and I (you and I)
That's the story of you and I
Ain't much glory in the story
But that's the story of you and I

That's the story of you and I
I was about to lose my mind
The story of you and I
Yeah
That's the story of you and I
Oh, I was fooled completely baby
That's the story of you and I
Story
That's the story
So sad ooh

// Who Would Have Thought? //

I knew that something was missing
I knew that something was wrong
But I never knew that you wouldn't stay
Who would have thought it would turn out this way
I knew there were unanswered questions
And I knew there were unspoken words
But I never knew the right things to say

Oh, who would have thought it would turn out this way
(Who would have thought) it would turn out this way

Oh, I knew there were lapses in judgment
(I knew) I knew there were serious flaws
But I never knew that my blue would turn gray, no
Who would have thought it would turn out this way

I knew there was room for improvement
(I knew) I knew there was work to be done
But I never knew the price I would pay
Who would have thought it would turn out this way
(Who would have thought)
Who would have thought it would turn out this way

There's a long road to run
To lead my heart into the sun
Holding on would mean it's too late
I've still got time oh, but time won't wait
No

Now I know that life is a blessing
Now I know that life is a gift
I learned my lesson and my life is OK
But who have thought it would turn out this way
(Who have thought) it would turn out this way
Who have thought it would turn out this way

// Addicted To You //

Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) hey hey
(Addicted to you) addicted to you baby

The moment I laid eyes on you
I knew that my life had changed
There's no doubt that you felt it too
I knew we'd never be the same
Oh, thinking about it now baby
I get emotional inside
I love it when I get this feeling
It's such a supernatural high
Oh yeah
Girl I'm all strung out on you (on you baby)
There's nothing I can do

Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) I'm hooked on you, baby
(Addicted to you) can't help myself

It seems like only yesterday
I remember how you made me smile
And whenever you were far away
I felt like an abandoned child
I just couldn't do without you baby
I knew I had to make you mine
Now after all these years together
I still want to love you till the end of time, oh
Girl I'm all strung out on you (I'm strung out on you, baby)
What am I gonna do?

Endlessly in love
Hopelessly in love
Head over heels in love
Addicted to you Baby
(Addicted to you) Oh, I'm
(Addicted to you) and I just can't help it
(Addicted to you) I'm all about you baby
(Addicted to you) Hey, come on
What am I gonna do?
I'm hooked on you, baby
(Addicted to you, what am I gonna do?)
All about you baby
(Addicted to you, what am I gonna do?
Give it to me girl
(What am I gonna do about it?)

// Sleeping With You Baby //

I don't need for you to be here every minute of the day
And I don't even need you darling, to wash my blues away
That's not to say that I don't love you heart and soul, cause I do
And every night I want to be there next to you

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

I don't ever want you feeling that your dreams can't come true
And I won't ever stop you sweetheart from doing what you have to do
Just make sure that we don't ever let our love get off the beam
And we will always be together to share our dream

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

I just love sleeping with you baby holding you all night
Sleeping with you baby hugging you real tight
I just love sleeping with you baby next to you all night
Cause when I'm sleeping with you baby everything's alright

(Sleeping with you baby)

(Sleeping with you baby) you and me, baby
(Sleeping with you baby) ooh

// If It's Tea Give Me Coffee //

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
So there's less inequity
Still I hate paying taxes
So I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might believe that social justice is the way
It's meant to be
Still I'm hoping to get rich
I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

Even if it's not a party
Even if it's just a clatch
If you can't tell the difference
I wanna know how you gonna mix and match

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
For accountability
Still I hate that bloated government
So I might go G.O.P.
If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

Even if it's wishful thinking
Even if it's fantasyland
Someone's got to pay the tab
That's not so hard to understand

If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
I might become progressive
So there's less inequity
Still I hate paying taxes
So I might go G.O.P.
But if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

(Tea, give me coffee)
Come on
(Coffee, give me tea)
Said if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
(Tea, give me coffee
Coffee, give me tea)
Said if it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea
(Tea, give me coffee)
Alright
(Coffee, give me tea)
If it's tea, give me coffee
If it's coffee, give me tea

// Beyond My Wildest Dreams //

I've been looking everywhere
I felt lost and lonely
Out of nowhere
There she was in front of me

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

(I, I found a love)
I found a love
(She is good)
So good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

There's no looking back
I thought I'd lost my soul
Got my life back on track
And then I gained control

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

I found a love
She is good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

I looked in her eyes
I saw honesty
She took my heart
And she said won't you come with me

I found a love
She is good to me
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams

Found a love, woah
(She is good)
So good
Down deep inside
Yes it seems
That it's all beyond my wildest dreams
Yes so good
So good to me
I never, never in my wildest dreams

(Never, never never)
(Never, never never)
Never knew a love like this before

(Never, never never)
(Never, never never)
So good
(In my wildest dreams)
She's so good
(Never, never never)
In my wildest dreams

// Any Excuse Will Do //

It's as good as could be expected in these uncertain times
But there must be many reasons for our precipitous decline

Blame it on the white man, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the Arabs and you can blame it on the Jews
Blame it on the Chinese cause they're growing by leaps and bounds
There's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Blame it on religion, you could blame it on the press
Blame it on the bureaucrats I chalk it up to stress
Blame it on a mindset where waste and fraud abound
Yes there's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
When there's all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do
Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
When there's all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do

Blame it on the unions, or blame it on your boss
Blame it on inflation, blame it on the cost
You might blame it on a system that has clearly broken down
There's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Blame it on the others, blame it on the freaks
Blame it on the brothers, blame it on the geeks
You could blame it on the theory that money trickles down
Yes there's more than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
With all this blame to go around
Any excuse'll do
Any excuse will do, Any excuse'll do
With all this blame to go around
Any excuse will do

There's more than enough and plenty
More than enough and plenty
More than enough and plenty blame to go around

Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
We keep blaming this, we keep blaming that
Any excuse will do
Any excuse'll do, Any excuse'll do
I'm telling you
Any excuse, any excuse
Any excuse will do

More than enough
And plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
And plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
Plenty of blame to go around
More than enough
Plenty of blame to go around
