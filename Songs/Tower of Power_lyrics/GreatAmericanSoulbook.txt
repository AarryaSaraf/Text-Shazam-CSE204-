// You Met Your Match //

Hey, yeah

You were good at playing the fox, girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hound for nobody
Girl, just wait till I get you home

I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

Oh baby

You played around with Jimmy and Freddie
Tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Suzie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel, babe

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met your match
When you played with my affection
You met your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
You met your match
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell from the vine, vine, vine, vine

Your mama told me that I'd better be mellow
She said, "You're just a baby, maybe too green"
I told her, "Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and big Joe
They knew better, mama shake off that dream"

Hey, I told her that you really were cooking
My love is burning, for turning to steam
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match

You played around with Jimmy and Freddie
Tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Suzie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel, babe

If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Say my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you

Hey babe

You met your match
When you played with my affection
You met your match
When you tried to make me walk the line
You met your match
You met your match, you met your match
You met your match, you met your match, you met your match

// I Thank You //

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

Then you took your love to someone else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold it but you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you

Every day was something new
You pull out your bag and you're fine to do
You got me trying new things too
Just so I can keep up with you

You didn't have to shake me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to make it like you did
But you did, yes you did and I thank you

All my life I've been shortchanged
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame
And now I know what the fellas are talking about
When they say that they been turned out

I want to thank you, I want to thank you
I want to thank you, thank you, baby

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did and I thank you
You didn't have to hold me like you did
But you did, yes you did and I thank you

I thank you, thank you, baby
I thank you, baby, I gotta thank you
...

Hand in hand with you where all the lovers meet

// It Takes Two //

One can have a dream baby, two can make that dream so real
One can talk about bein' in love, two can say how it feels
Well, one can wish upon a star, two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark, two can make the light shine through

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery, yeah
Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar drinkin' all alone by herself
Two can make that lonely place seem like somewhere else

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

It takes two, it takes two baby
Just me and you, me and you
It takes two

It takes two

And one can go out to a movie lookin' for a special treat
Two can make that movie somethin' kinda sweet
One can take a walk in the moonlight thinkin' that it's really nice
Two walkin' hand in hand adds such a touch of spice

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you, just us two, us two
It takes two baby, it takes two baby
To make a dream come true, it just takes two

It takes two baby, it takes two baby
Me and you

// Me & Mrs. Jones //

Me and Mrs. Jones we've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafÃ©
Six-thirty and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands and making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones we've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We've gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations and so, so do I

Me, me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones we've got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now
No, no no, no, no, no

When it's time for us to be leaving
It hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
Now she'll go her way and sugar I'll go my way
Tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time

Me and, and Mrs. Jones we got a thing going on
Yes we do, yes we do
My, my, my, my lady Jones
I love her, yes I do y'all

We know, they know, you know and I know
We gonna have to talk it over baby
Talk it over
Mrs. Jones you're my lady

My, my, my, my, my, you're my sweet foxy thing baby
And you know I love you but miss that
We can't meet at the same time, at the same place, at the same cafÃ©
We better talk it over, we're gonna talk it over

You know I love you Mrs. Jones
And this is going on nowhere baby
You go your way and I go my way
Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
I love her, yes I do

// Mr. Pitiful //

Listen to this

Call me Mr. Pitiful, baby that's my name
They call me Mr. Pitiful, that's how I got my fame
But you see people just don't understand
What make a man feel so blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful 'cause I lost someone just like you

Call me Mr. Pitiful, this everybody knows
They call me Mr. Pitiful most everyplace I go
But you see nobody seems to understand
How can a man sing such a sad, sad song
When he lost, when he lost everything
When he lost everything he had

How can I explain to you
How somebody could be so very blue?
How can I tell you about my past
If things won't even last?

Mr. Pitiful that's my name
They call me Mr. Pitiful, that's how I got my fame
Some people won't understand
What makes a man feel so very blue
They call me Mr. Pitiful because I am in love with you

Can I explain to you?
I've lost everything I had
Everything is going wrong
Just trying to get back to you

I have to sing this sad, sad songs
I want you, I want you, I want you
Get back, I've got to have you
I want you, I want you, I want you

// Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel //

Heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

Your kiss filled with tenderness, I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes with showers
And every hour of the hour you let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder
When you came my cup runneth over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear a cryin' from above

It's 'cause heaven must be missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

It's like heaven, it's like heaven
Oh, it's like heaven, now it's like heaven

I'm captured by your spell, you're different girl, I can tell
When you're layin' on my pillow baby
Above your pretty head there's a halo, that's why I know

Heaven missin' an angel
Missin' one angel child 'cause you're here with me right now
You're heavenly baby, heavenly to me baby

It's like heaven, girl you're like heaven
Oh, it's like heaven, in one night you're like heaven

My pretty baby, you're my darlin' angel
Oh, it's so beautiful baby, girl you're like heaven

She's so good, she's so good
I know, I know, I know, I know I love her so
Baby, baby, baby, baby you're so good

Good, she's so good, lady you're so good
She's so good
You're my sunshine on a rainy day
You're my sunshine on a rainy day

She's so good, she's so good
You're my heaven, you're my heaven
My, my pretty angel
You're my little angel

// Since You've Been Gone (Baby, Baby, Sweet Baby) //

Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips, but not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray, darlin'

Hear me now (Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Hear me)
Got to get you back somehow (Hear me now)

I'm trying
Take me back, consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Well I've been so lonely

Baby baby baby, sweet sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips, but not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray, oh babe

Do you hear me darlin' yeah (Hear me)
I don't know what I'm gonna do (Hear me)
Got to get you back somehow (Hear me now)

Oh baby
Take me back, consider me please
If you walk through my door
I can get up off my knees
I just feel so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it? Why'd you have to do it?)
I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet, so sweet darlin')
Since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet, so sweet darlin')

// Who Is He (And What Is He To You)? //

A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you, you looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?

Something in my heart and in your eyes
Tells me that he's not someone passin' by
And when you cleared your throat was that your cue?
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?

Now when I add the sum of you and me, dig this
I get confused 'cause I keep coming up with three
Well listen, you're too much for one man and not enough for two
Dag gummit, who is he and what is he to you?
What is he to you? I wanna know

Now tell me you that man don't have much intuition, no
Is that what you really think woman or are you wishin'?
Listen, before you wreck your old home be sure about your new
Dag gummit, who is he? What is he to you?
What is he to you? Someone, somebody say it

Say it again baby
Woman respect yourself, respect yourself
Who was that man with you girl?
What is he to you? 'Cause who was he to you?

What is he to you?
Tell me who are you lovin'?
Who is he to you, baby?
Respect yourself, respect yourself
Who was he to you?
Who was he to you lady?
I gotta know right now
Just tell me
