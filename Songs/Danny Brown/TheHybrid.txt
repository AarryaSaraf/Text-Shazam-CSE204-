Album: TheHybrid

// Greatest Rapper Ever //

My homie's a magician with the tec
Make your chain disappear and reappear on his neck
I ain't tricking with you hoes, but shit don't ask him
Only thing I give a bitch? A fucking orgasm
I'll throw you in the river, hands tied tight
Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight
I'm spitting that dope shit, smoking on regulars
Writing 16's like internet child predators
Rocking that 10 deep, but I stay dolo
You wearing polo, who are you, Young Dro?
I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio
Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario
Dawson, awesome, hit the head, mario
Sorry yo my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets
She gave me that Becky, I gave her that yoshi
The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif
Go and sell a beat, you never sold a rock
Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch
Could've signed to The Roc, nah I'm signed to the streets
The D is the only thing that's profiting for me
Feeling like big meech, when we're about to cook up
But not the one from BMF dawg, the one from Lynwood
It ain't a nigga I know
Three years straight
3 dollar blows
Good any hood, anywhere I go I'm straight
Nigga hit me with a hundred cause the look on my face
Mama I'm honored to be your son
Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one
Used to be in a rush, to finish off my sack
I was so thirsty dawg, sold a pregnant bitch crack
Let her pay me extra, smoke it in the back
Then she came back
Tities on smacking herself on the back
Talking about something crawling on her
Looking like the world's falling on her
And I pushed it
You rub the foots of the bitches I mushed
Funky ass cutlass 3 deep, blowing kush
[?] got her shook
Started reading once the judge threw the fucking book
But the block was off the hook, said fuck class
Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast
Young buck, look, now a grown up
Now I pop those same pills, listening to Donuts
I rap like I bet my life because in all actuality, nigga I did
You rap like you used to hit the pipe
Nah nigga that ain't crack, that's crack head shit
Rep that shit, Will tell a bitch
You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick
You trick on the bitch, dawg you ain't rich
Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib
You seeing Brown? Nope, never
About to live the title of the greatest rapper ever

// Need Another Drink //

Hybrid

[Hook:]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 1:]
I see a lot of hoes
They all on my dick
Bunch of player haters want to front for a bitch
If a bitch want to fuck me
Then let her do her thing
Just step the fuck back and let her give me brains
I'm insane like who'm sayin'
It's like I got two brains
See my shoe game
Hate'm shit's butane
Y'all niggas too lame
My bill game like poon tang
Nine niggas on a track like Wu Tang
Shoot like two God from too lame
Big ving-rang niggas at the door like... like... like... you rang?
No need for ID
Walk straight past security they don't search me
Put three numbers in my phone for RS-VIP

[Hook: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

[Verse 2:]
On the block (On the block)
And on the street (On the street)
They keep banging
They keep banging them trees
No seeds in my cigarillo
We be blacker than romillo
Tasting like Sugar Hills
Let me pop another pill
Silver eighteen hundred
Kryptonite (Yep yep yep!)
I'm on it
No not superman you can call it x-clan
Black red and green to see
All my bitches eat pussy like missy
But they look like Chrissy
From Three's Company
Roll another blunt for me
Smoke so much weed like I'm trying to live my memory
Like I'm trying to smoke away my mad thoughts
Blunt gave 'em up, a bit too bad go
She wanna hit it (hit it)
And I do too
I ain't talkin' bout the weed bitch
I'm talking 'bout you!

[Hook: x2]
When It's Hot
You need another drink
What cha' think
A nigga gonna do
Go outside
Smoke a blunt in the car and come back
And get some love in the club

// New Era //

[Verse 1:]
Niggas out here snitchin, do my dirt all by my lonely
I been in the D so long that I don't even like Coney
And you could never be my homie
I'm a Linwood nigga that was raised up on bologna
Say we over here (hustlin), over there (grindin)
Calculator wrist watch, multiply my timing
I be with your girlfriend, say she like my rhymin
Dog, I shine so hard that I don't need no goddamn diamonds
I'm up in Eastland, just to hit Lids
Walked up in the store, you know just what I did
Lookin at the wall, you know the other half
Blue tiger fitted in a seven and a half

[Hook:]
And I rocks that shit any climate and weather
In my brand new blue tiger-fitted New Era
And I reps that shit right now forever
(Old English D on a blue New Era)

[Verse 2:]
So fuck who you are
I been in the D so long when outta town your store barred
And you could never be my man
Fuck a turkey on Thanksgiving niggas lucky to get ham
An every hood I'm in niggas greet me with what up doe!
We call fiends "custo's" freak hoes "custo's"
If we say the hook then we really mean the po-po
If we say that's bold then we mean that's fucked up, bro
Niggas don't know gotta put 'em on the slang
Out of town niggas lost hip 'em to the game
You know where I'm from, no matter where I'm at
Cause of the logo on my New Era hat

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Ain't heard it like this in a while
I been in the D so long that I don't go to Bell Isle
Now do I look like your [?]
If I ain't got no Newports I'm a freak a Black and Mild
Say I'm riding down (7 Mile) bout to hit the Lodge
You front I put a knife in you like you a shish-kebab
Your baby mama slobber put my palm up on her bob
She go (up down, up down) oh God
We headin downtown, ridin through the tunnel
Smokin on some [?] keep it a hundred
Where the hood Crip niggas don't know how to act
You look up in the car all you see is D hats

[Hook]

// Exotic //

[Verse 1 - Danny Brown:]
I blow three blunts before lunch and turn a rapper into dinner
Serve the east side taught me Bel-Air Shopping Center
The west side, these niggas call me Green Field Plaza
You ain't got no connect nigga, you coppin' from El Blaga
Continue on the saga
Your mouth is Fierce as Sasha
Makin' millions off the girls, I'm Beyonce's father
I'm sittin' in the Charger
You niggas Lady Gaga
Left my car charger, CD changer no Carter
Dwayne or Shawn, Sean Price mixed with Lil' Jon
Off the fifth of rum
Piff in my lungs
Fuckin' two Asian bitches till they couldn't cum
And when them hoes squirt it's like Hong Kong Wonton
They said, "Oh my, biggest dick I've seen."
Showed her on the webcam, she start lickin' the screen
Next week we party puttin' coke all up in her nose
Just me, my nigga Luke and a house full of hoes

[Hook - Danny Brown:]
And it's coke on the corner
Guns in the closet
Pills on the table
Blowin' on exotics
Money on the mantle
Fuck direct deposit
Old school Chevy next year we roll exotics

[Verse 2 - Dopehead:]
That cutty steering wheel all wood like a beaver bed
Your bitch neck move faster than cheetah legs
Nike 6.0's look like Zebra heads
Wack MC's, I eat 'em like pita bread
Rappers
I voicemail your best bitch
In the hood, hoes give me more throat than neck strength
All I want is money
Cash no checks
I swear the sight of kushy makes her pussy so wet
(I say)
My flow cold as the walls in the precinct
I'm a monster
Eat pussy like Wheat Thins
I'm a rock star
Without a guitar
My chocolate melts in your girl mouth, Mr. Goodbar
(And its)
Weed on the corner
Guns on the target
Shawty goin' crazy, sniffin' coke in the closet
While I'm sittin' on the toilet puffin' on exotics
Bitch busts in the bathroom and fuckin' vomits

[Hook]

// I'm Out //

I had to be like 15
My dawg ain't have his ills but copped a Cutlass Supreme
Clean from an old white dude, he got a deal
And at the gas station where he got killed
Late night filling up
Niggas shot him up
Asleep when the call came, news when I woke up
17, carjacked, dead at the Mobil
I swear I shed a tear every time I see a photo
Now I'm all grown up same spot [?]
Old school Chevy check the rear view mirror
Give a bum a buck, show the hood niggas love
Pocket full of kush so I hit them with a nug
My homie left the hood, I ain't seen him in a minute
Pull up smoking reggie with his bitch in a rental
He said "I just got out" and can I let him hold something
I told him that I'm broke, man I ain't got nothing

[Hook]
And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush the color Minnesota Viking
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night end
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]

See this is all we know
Just running round the hood dawg with nowhere to go
Wanna grab some swishers but the narcs at the store
So we parked at my man's, put the chronic on hold
So now we just posting, drinking on some 40s
My nigga got his 40 said drop him at his shorty's
Told my nigga chill, about to roll one with hash
Soon as the hook leave then my nigga we can smash
All in rotation, puff puff passin'
Eyes like cherries through magnifying glasses
Think I got the munchies, my nigga, you hungry?
Bout to ride to courttown grab us some munchies
The blunt turned to ash, gave a [?] and laughed
Drunk the rest of the 40, threw the bottle in the trash
Made sure I had my phone, grabbed a square out the pack
Gave my homie that, jumped in the Cutty and I smashed

And I'm out (aight then)
In a '87 Cutty about to go pick up a light skin
And I'm out (aight then)
Blowing on some kush [?]
And I'm out (aight then)
Catch me swooping up a freak and I'm knowing how my night ends
And I'm out (aight then)
Saying killa has some lightning [?]

// Re-Up //

Used to get domed up by crackheads,
And still got my balls licked by pretty bitches,
Sack n the Scottie Pippen's, Kid on the Gotti mission,
But seen his down fall is your best friend snitching
I'm in the kitchen with the mcspoon and lactose,
Rat bitch rubbing on her titties on the row
Nigga come down, listen for the doe,
I know my baby momma bet not call no mo,
Bitch talking Pampers, no she's full of shit,
Impossible for babies 2 take that many shits.
Rapping about bricks but I ain't never seen one,
I think I've seen like three hundred bo's once,
Fuck 'em with 'em addicts, holding automatics...
Dog I ain't lying even served a Dramatic,
Used to bring the lettuce then I had to dead it
Ass tried to song every time he wanted credit

[Chorus:]
And I'm trying to make re-up
Fuck around, put a G-up
And blow a blunt with my man,
See I'm just trying to make re-up.
Fuck around and put a g-up,
And drink a fifth for my niggas,
See, I'm just trying to make a re-up.
Fuck around, put a G-up
And blow a blunt with my man,
See I'm just trying to make re-up.
Fuck around and put a g-up,
And drink a fifth for my niggas!

Christmas every year come faster and faster
New Year come around claim my baby on your taxes.
Dog I kno connects, you middleman taxing,
3 gram dimes of green, u was rocking chloe glasses
Did for the Jordans for what you feel important
I'm 02 my weed increased the dropout rate at northern,
Senior bitches skipping, get em weeded out,
And take her in the back room, my nigga smut em out,
Hoodrat bitches putting blunts in they mouth,
Smoke some weed, order coney time 2 fuck it out,
Rock a fit 4 3 days then go and cop a new one,
Rode a bike to linwood just to give away my ones,
Hopping out the cab and when I step out,
First thing they say I ain't kno them came out,
But nigga I ain't trippin I'm grinding on a few bucks,
Really ballin and I'm trying step it up.

[Chorus:]
And I'm trying to make re-up
Fuck around, put a G-up
And blow a blunt with my man,
See I'm just trying to make re-up.
Fuck around and put a g-up,
And drink a fifth for my niggas,
See, I'm just trying to make a re-up.
Fuck around, put a G-up
And blow a blunt with my man,
See I'm just trying to make re-up.
Fuck around and put a g-up,
And drink a fifth for my niggas!

// Nowhere 2 Go //

It's Detroit Stand Up!

I'm in the truck sitting high like proper etiquette
Iller than I ever been
Blowing on that medicine
Used to have dreams of copping cribs on Edison

Now I'm doing shit thought I never could afford
Art on the wall like science project boards
Parquet floor
Green like Celtic
Furniture you touch be like what's this velvet?
Used to play the block with the sack by the pelvis
Fiends O.D.ing on they toilet like Elvis (eww)

So now I kill beats
So much coroners pick up notepad sheets
Bullhead skinnies Hilfiger fleece
Sort of like a futuristic 1993
A lot my niggas dead
A lot my niggas locked
A lot my niggas left and moved on from the block
Some of my niggas here
And some got guap
And some may gotta piss in a motherfucking pot
We used to play the block
We never get old
The fridge ain't got shit but the bread with the mold
And some ain't got shoes just the ones with the holes
The one you call talkers with the fucking plastic soles
So now we change the system
To shit we can't afford and
Check from Mickey D's can't buy a pair of Jordans
And hotboys gotta get it how they live

[Hook:]
Close your eyes I'm bout to take you to a city, it ain't pretty, it ain't nowhere to go
Run and hide when you on the other side it ain't easy it ain't nowhere to go
Land of misery a place full of history but seriously it's nowhere to go

I seen my nigga Luck before he went up for life
He said Brown you nice and nigga send your sacrifice
Chill on the streets it ain't here for ya
Cause when you get locked don't nobody care for ya
Did a little time ain't make a phone call
Book stay thick like a church going broad
Locked in the county ain't never seen a thorough
Now I hit the thrift stores cop a vicious polo
Never talk loud to get my point across
The only alligator that I rock is LaCoste
Detroit player word to my nigga B.I.G
Play this type of shit while you rockin up for B.I.G
Cause I blow 2 blunts before I brush my teeth
Ain't seen what they looking like but I'm smoking good
Eating Better
So I stay full
J stay paid
Brown do too

[Hook]

// Shootin' Moves //

Piranhas, stay on my toes like orthodontists
Dopeman Nikes, George Costanza
Nigga it's colonic when I vomit
Get in niggas ass
You's a fag just for thinking gay
Nigga you ain't Andre
Better get an Hors D'ouvre, nigga you a cold sore
Lips of a prostitute, buff ass nigga
Having trouble with the childproof, nigga outlined you
Don't make me go back to that, nigga on a mongoose
Rest in peace Ron Gook, sitting in a old school
Smoking on some Goku, buds like Dragon Balls
Tequila with the lime juice, times two cyborgs
Smoking on some grapefruit, hoes come twice
But it's three if I eat the cooch
Peach coupe, no roof
When my hoes coming through
My bitches rap better than you
So quit worrying about what I'm gon' do
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doin'
I'm shooting moves...

[Hook:]
So nigga quit worrying, about what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga I'm shooting moves...
So nigga quit worrying, about what I'm doing
Cause I could give a flying fuck about what you doing
My nigga I'm shootin' moves

Used to wait for the Dexter, smoking on that Newport
Stacks in the phone posit, work in the Jansport
Prayin for a personal, every time I go to court
Eastland shopping bag, ho's at the food court
Around the time you got your sounds put in that mammoth
I was on Clairmount, 3 for 10 slangin'
Shining like the silver on a Air Max '95
Took this rap shit serious about in '05
Got these niggas scared, ask them if I'm lyin'
Because I shit on niggas bar for bar without trying
Ain't in your top three? Then bitch you can't count
Only thing that makes sense is dollar amount
Ounce to the face, stank go to waste
You still tryna find a place to record your mixtape
...this ain't here for ya
Even Jesus tried to break the teeth for droppin' vocals

[Hook]

// The Nana Song //

Tell me why my dimes look pregnant
That niggas know my connect Mexican
Hoes with light completion little to no melanin
Smoking on the purple the herbal is so elegant
(In-ta-legend?) bitches from college that study medicine
Drop it in they face like visine medicine
In your hood liquor store cop a slice of pizza
Skinnys on playing with the rockets like Ariza
Nigga don't confuse it think it's just music
Niggas think Hip Hop is book-bags and chew-sticks
Things out front (beckbachains?) for our rows
Ain't talking about flowers let them hold a couple dollars
It's like it's Catch Phrase, roll a sack of haze
Fuck tomorrow dog we ain't promised today
So tell me what's the reason these niggas eating
I feel like the whole damn industry teasing
These niggas eatin?
I feel like the industry teasing

[Chorus:] (Nana)

I used to cop a nick bag & pull 2 out it
Man these rap jury niggas ain't looking to cloudy
Sitting in the Audi LA at the do over
Throwing up the middle finger yelling "Fuck Oprah"
You in the hood nigga, trying to get your buzz up
I'm at the Standard nigga 2 bitches with they tops up
And watch em treat each other like the buffet
While you doing calling orders at the Cony
Hoes say the dick so huge that you can package pre-orders up through the roof
So keep sleeping on me I'm a wake up with your bitch
Rolling over asking her, "Know how to make grits? "
Nigga I'm the shit, so homie don't piss me
Eat pussy so good none of my hoes kiss me
Lick ya bitch or I'm a be eating
The next time you call that ho a be teasing like

[Chorus:] (Nana)

// Guitar Solo //

My little nigga fourteen...
Got his hand on the forty with the infrared beam
His daddy locked up and his mama is a fiend
Catch her trickin' on the corner, knees dirty on her jeans
At night he never dreams cause he hardly ever sleep
Layin' in the bed facin' someone else's feet
So late night he creep, walk around these streets
With the same hoodie on, he been wearin' for a week
He wants something to eat, and his sneaks so scuffed
Just lookin' in his eyes, you can tell he livin' rough
Standing outside a gas station puffin' on a loosie
Dropped outta school cause his peers appeared bougie
And they wear gucci, and shit that rappers talk
Robbed an old lady but his ass got caught
Will he get out, man I really don't know bro
I hope I'll find out after the guitar solo

After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...

This little girl pregnant man she only fourteen
Bust in by an older nigga, lack of self-esteem
Her mom's a gold-digger, and her dad is not around
Last time she saw him he took her to Belle Isle
A child with a child and her mama don't care
Another bridge card gon' put her on welfare
Baby daddy say he got her, prolly won't succeed
Cause he bought a pair of cardi's 'stead of reing-up the weed
His dream is a cutty with some rims on that bitch
Is that the type of man you want raising your kids?
So now you ditch class cause your belly getting bigger
And every other day yo' mama fuck another nigga
So what she gonna do is find herself a drug dealer
Her dream and goal in life is to be saved by a nigga
And will she get far? I really don't know bro
I hope I find out after the guitar solo

The guitar solo...
After the guitar solo...
The guitar solo...
Guitar solo...

// White Stripes //

Check
Nigga get a life, ten deep crewneck
Blunt to the face nigga, never ask who's next
Homie, I ain't two Tecs, that's BIG homie, ay
Where the fuck was his gangster ass out in LA
A Bay Bay, this is a not a dis
But your bitch look like Hurricane Chris
And nigga it's fact,
That what you rap fiction
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Your bitches do my braids, say dog I be hittin'
Never knew my dick be where you be kissin'
When I shoot missions, gotta keep a clip in
Or roll deep like roaches in my kitchen
Dog, I ain't trippin', but they never gone
They don't even run when I cut the lights on
Homes what's the biz? Nigga watch yo' kids
Ya bitch say my dick bigger than John Holmes'
Limes in Corona, 2 for 18,
Might pop Adderall, I don't fuck with no lean
Didn't at a mall, nigga fuck 'em all
Walk in thrift stores now watch daddy ball
Vintage ass fleeces, skinny, no creases
Me and these is like ETs and Reeses Pieces
Layin' on beaches, ho's toe's pedicured
Bitch gave me head 'cause she liked my metaphors
Bout gettin' head, isn't that ironic like Alanis Morissette?

Check
Tight like corsets 'round the waists of S&M bitches
Bitch ass fat like Delicious is
Hoes say I'm inconsiderate
'Cause I make 'em treat my dick like licorice
They can get a pack of Twizzlers on me
Light skinned bitch, that I call darkie
Always in beef like Eek The Cat & Sharkie
So I ate the cat, now she heart me
Roll another spliff, pop another pill
Live every day like a nigga goin' away
Window didn't lock, fuck 'em with the pot
Gotta nigga two hots and a top cot
So niggas like to plot, I move on instinct
Nigga I could walk down a year on the precinct
And these bars'll still be hotter than your new shit
Why you tryna keep it warm like somebody else piss
In that drop on the way to the P.O.
You talk shit, turn his bitch to El Nino
Red jalepeno, flow Neo-Geo
Rock like Lil' John "Bia Bia" live in Rio
Nigga, you a peepshow, fuckin' quarter freak ho
Hit you with the psycho, now you el finito

// Juno //

Detroit so crazy, feel like Pac

Put you on child support now you got to go to court
Now they hit your checks to take care of that (baby)
Thought about abortion but she couldn't afford it
And you was locked up, fighting them charges
Now you on the street, diapers ain't cheap
And you slang weed to take care of that (baby)
No education, the odds are slim of making it
So now you'll fuck with any nigga that'll bring the bacon in

Detroit so crazy, feel like Pac
Brenda's got a (baby)
Everywhere I look, young girl up in them books
Virginity took, now she 'bout to have a (baby)

'Cause nobody else care, 'cause 2Pac ain't there
Dropped outta high school, tried to go to night school
Got a GED to take care of that (baby)
Now she smoke blunts on the block and her feet ain't never washed
Tryin' a get someone to watch her (baby)
Have a baby in your teens, grown nobody want ya
Because ain't nobody tryin' a be a damn step-father

So watch what you do, burns out at twenty-two
Any man you meet don't give a damn about you

// Thank God //

Ain't no more food stamps, man they been stopped that
Give it to you on the card if you follow these steps
And my girl got one, mean we gon' eat good
A week out the month mean we gon' be full
And it's so hard, we depend on that
But who cares if generic brands in the cabinet?
So I'mma hit the hood, and see what's up though
Maybe try to cop some gan, hopefully I serve some custos
But if it don't work, I ain't gon' trip
Cause when my girl get off of work we got to hit the market
And I got to help her with the boxes out the car
Yeah boxes, boxes out the car
And it might sound hard but the stakes so soft
And I love the way she cook, hook the rice up with the broth
Yeah, pour another glass of pop y'all
And thank God for a Bridge Card

[Hook x2]
Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save A Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card (hey!)

They say the hood starving, but we be eating
Frying wing dings with the fake Lawry seasoning
Yeah Larry's, but it's still good though
Just one swipe, we barbecuing in the hood, bro
Eating cheese doodles, don't let the size fool you
Tonight we eating shrimp, take a break from the noodles
Yeah, and you know we out of place
When welfare the only thing that put a smile on her face
So baby cook some breakfast, I need my energy
I hit the block fresh, time to serve these fiends
Just trying to catch sales, you know how I do
And she got the WIC Card, so that's mad Juicy Juice
And I pipe her, call me the plumber
Even let me hit the store, told me her PIN number
Took the kids with me, told 'em go hard
Yeah, and thank God for a Bridge Card

[Hook x2]
Let's bow our heads, hold hands, and thank God
Let's hit the market my baby and go hard
Let's hit Save A Lot and we can buy it all
Thank God for a Bridge Card (hey!)

// Drinks On Me //

[Verse 1:]
You got your neice to babysit ya baby
Toes lookin' right cause early you got a pedi
You ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy
Go out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday
But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think
Just let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol
You ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow
Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends
Start being in thoughts cause the party never ends
I.D. say 22, forever 21
Best friend 30, she forever 21
Goin' down the same path, take another sip
Pour another glass, take another hit
I tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did
Probably why it ain't a pop around for none of yoгк kids
Sorry for puttin' out ya biz
But right now I can't stop lookin' at them tits
And grabbin' on that ass, fillin' up the glass
Get you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task
And she really helpin', bein' a real sport about it
Full cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it
20 minutes later, man, she really all about it
20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me

[Hook:]
Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your I.D. hangin' with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Hennessey and Grand Cru for me
I take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me
So don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees
I said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me

[Verse 2:]
Say my auntie sort of like an alcoholic
Been drinkin' since the teens, shittin' blood in the toilet
Started real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her
Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I took showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinkin' on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of Keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, lookin' towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow
Live where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow
Say fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me

[Hook]

// Generation Rx //

[Verse 1:]
Lookin' at this pill in the middle of my palm
Pop it, sip some cola, thirty minutes, it be on
Staring at the sidekick, words come to me
Rolling up the swisha, puffin' on the loosie
Got a nigga focused feelin' all right
With this type of feelin' I can write all night
I never had a problem with payin' attention
Popped the adderall then I wrote a verse in minutes
Play this in your ipod, noddin' on vicodin
Man, this shit legal, it must be alright then
Nigga, yeah right, this shit even worse
When doctor wrote prescription, your addiction was birthed
Turn your kids to fiends with a drug called ritalin
This is for my niggas popping xannies not rememberin'
What they did last night
Pills and orange tubes got the government right
They say there's no stoppin' from starting oxycontins
They in trailer parks sniffin' it with rolled dollars
All about a dollar, baby killers in the world
The ones that supply you when you gotta fuckin' cold

[Hook:]
I can't feel
When I'm off this pill
No doubt I done them all
Xanny bars, adderall
My mind drifts
Let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowin in the wind
Eat pills and vicodin

[Verse 2:]
They say I might go out like heath ledger
Laughin' at the joker of an antidepressant
And if you can't sleep
They got a pill for that
Brown good in poppin' enzyte to get my dick fat
Fags take hormones to grow a set of titties
Got a pill to make your dick hard when you're sixty
Now tell me do that add up, g, when they lock your ass up
For a dimebag of weed
Teen girls take birth control killing off the seeds
Got her lookin' twenty when she only fifteen
They got illegal ones like x and mescaline
In my teens my homie took one, he did fifteen
My granny turned out on them blood pressure pills
And if she don't pop em, she might not be here
But is it really helpin' make a nigga shed a tear
I wonder, do they make a pill to take away your fears?

[Hook:]
I can't feel
When I'm off this pill
No doubt I done them all
Xanny bars, adderall
My mind drifts
Let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowin in the wind
Eat pills and vicodin

// S.O.S. //

[Verse 1:]
I act like I'm that baby Brenda threw away
But I shine like I never seen a rainy day
Kinda cloudy like them diamonds that them rappers wear
Clownin' like jesters that be in front of kings chairs
But they don't make a crown big enough to fit my head
My self-esteem high, see it can nest eggs
I'm sipping vodka straight, eating on fish eggs
Cashmere, and the color pastel
Used to have that crack like the liberty bell
But now I hit chicks with lips like Estelle
New SL, lights like fish eyes
Bitches say the dick good like Mickey D's French fries
Y'all never held weight sorta like a [?]
Think you're doing bad? Think about Apartheid
Look in a narc's eyes, ask him why he flicked me
Said, "Brown, I had to; just look at your history"
Tried to tell the dude the truth
He still reminiscing when he used to lock me up for curfew
But I was just a young nigga staying past street lights
Kinda fascinated finding out what the streets like
Learned my lesson, for sure changed my ways
But the hook still treat me like the kid I was yesterday

[Hook:]
And I'm still that nigga
We just getting started, roll another swisher
Crack another brew, cop another fifth
These rap niggas trash and all their beats filth
I pull up on them, my hat on tilt
The cutty sitting high like Shaq on stilts

[Verse 2:]
It's like a unidentified foreign object
How you describe Brown as simple as a clock tick
But his beats harder than a witch nipple
Crazy as a hippie with a rifle sipping ripple
Beat you with a mini bat 'til you reconsider that
That chain looking rusty dog, get rid of that
I'm a pirate with the pyrex
Might fuck a bitch raw, Magic ain't died yet
Y'all niggas flow like cable, just the basic channel
Dough in front the fireplace, stack center mantel
Pleading guilty to anything they offer us
Copping out like quitting police officers
But we off it bruh, cases we forfeit
6's high, hope the 24's fit
Instigate beef and we all get torched
In the middle of the bull, like united center half court
Blow newport, laughing at you hoes
Hitting y'all raw like wetting Gizmo
After twelve, how can I excel
In the city where niggas don't know what's real

[Hook]
