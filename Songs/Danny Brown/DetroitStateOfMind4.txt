// D-Boyz //

[Wajeed:]
W-A-A-J-E-E-D, ha ha ha ha ha, yeah, yah
It's serious, go ahead
C'mon now down in Detroit

[T3:]
See where I'm from, niggas will smoke you for small paper
It's dangerous in the D, beware of 7 Mile players
East don't like the West, the West say the East is some haters
Gator haven, old school whips, chrome plated
Color-coordinated fabrics, Cartier glasses, yes!
It's the home of them dudes that's fantastic, yes!
They'll bust in your attic and start blasting
Looking for that ganj' you better have it fast
Bitch-ass, we ask last and then smash
Pass the cops, I don't give a fuck I'm playin'
Conscious niggas hold pistols in Detroit
This ain't Orange County, nigga, this is Detroit
And I'm a D-boy I'm building the "estroy"
Home of the Lords and the motherfucking Cheddar Boys
Hex murderer, trick-trick
We click-click, boom
And let the pistols clear the room, I assume
Come to my city, you better holla
Or watch out for my niggas creeping in Impalas

We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
You probably wouldn't get it if you come from out of town
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
We're getting all the paper, man, we're spreading it around
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
They call us Jenny Craig the way my niggas move pounds
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
We shoot this fucker up and make a nigga run a mile
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz

And we roll deep, ask some motherfucker about we
We on our feet
Sorry, hardly got me acting rowdy
Just enough Bacardi but this is how we party
Probably step in the joint for some Henny and some Coke
Part of my code, I prolly got a nina in my coat
Gucci [?] heads up on my toe, I'm a goat
Plus the cash that I throw is like it never touch the floor
[?] Yeah, such a professional
The blow and the 'dro in the floor near the dresser drawer
Take us as jealous, ho, dare you to touch it, though
Violence start piling we ain't smilin'
Don't you hear them violins, somebody must have died and
Nobody couldn't survive that moment of silence, uh

[Danny Brown:]
Got my D fitted like Magnum PI
Keep the Big Mac on me, for you small fries
Blowing on haze, four deep in the Mercury
Y'all niggas gay like Eddie Mercury
Baby momma going down slow Ron Burgundy
Forty cal. wake niggas early like courtesy calls
Y'all on my balls like Pilate class
Shotty blast, ring of fire, like Johnny Cash
I don't eat rappers, I eat baby mommas
You at Mickey D's while we at Benihana's
Every time you call she tell you "low cell"
And when you call back it's straight voice mail
Cause she's with the G's, me and T3
SB, Nudie Jeans, you look tacky
Y'all fake like Jackie
Talkin' 'bout murder but we know you just rapping
Talking gun play, but you never made it happen
Talking 'bout work, but your never sold a capsule
Now, is it just me or these niggas bars gay like that one on Police Academy
Actually, these niggas just dumb
Hoes in the village when we walk through the slums
Where me and 3 from, keep a gat
So I guess that's where you at

[T3:]
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
You probably wouldn't get it if you come from out of town
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
We're getting all the paper, man, we're spreading it around
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
They call us Jenny Craig the way my niggas move pounds
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz
We shoot this fucker up and make a nigga run a mile
We're some D-Boyz, D-Boyz, D-Boyz

[Waajeed:]
I dare you come on, yo
One, two
And we're killing this rap shit
Black Milk, Guilty Simpson, yeah, Slum Village, Elzhi, yeah
You know how we're doing this shit, fat cat
One, two, Detroit

// Keeps It 100 //

And I ain't no super-thug, nothing like that

Niggas come around with all that pussy ass frontin'
Nigga you'll get stomped, pushed with the pump
Beat, stripped ass ho naked in the trunk
Bitch you in the back, nigga we in the front
Fully automatic MP5 I'm a thug
Got a problem with the D? Then I'm suggesting you jump
We gon' keep it 100 leave you with 100 lumps
Now you walk around sick looking like you've got the mumps
Stanky bitches you running with, them niggas punks

See niggas is hard heads until they get taught
A motherfucking lesson then they ass get caught
For thinking that it's sweet like Mickey D's sweet tea
And you gon' see how easy I squeeze
This ain't no rap shit this more like a letter
To any stupid nigga that don't know better
So you gon' learn, get taught a quick lesson
Get your ass burned, bullets will have your flesh melting
You know I'm a G, you can see it in my eyes
You come to the D you'll get young burgularised
And that ain't no threat it's more like a promise
I'll put that on coupe, I'll put that on my Mama

I keeps it 100, 100 on the streets
Pay a couple hundred get a nigga put to sleep
I keeps it 100, 100 on the tree

Pay a couple hundred get a nigga put to sleep

// Gametime //

Before a blunt I blow a newport like an appetiser
Grab a mic' and get vexed, blow your amplifiers
Can't find me in the hood without a kush stick
That's like Cornel West eating out a white bitch
Rap's Robin trying to give to the poor
But these batty man Robin Givens
Never slipping on these bitches I ain't tripping
[?] like a wack transmission
I saw the signs like the Ace of Base in it
Opened my eyes like I was surprised
I rep the D' with a whole lot of pride
And do that until the day that I die
Fashion that's influenced by the skaters
SB's, Levi's, capital E's
White girls on me, and I'm a take advantage

Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time
Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time

It's like that, you know it's like that
Number 10 white Jordans with the grey and black
When I attack they need more than a ice pack
If you come back and fuck around and have an eye patch
This rap shit is more than my hobby
But iller than a convict who killed for one
Blowing blunts with my nigga and we still ain't done
Smack any motherfucker who says hustling's fun
Trying to chill from going nuts
Planning to get piff while listening to Donuts
[?] hold up, bitch nigga run it
Kick it in your stomach like you've got a baby in it
Why you so timid? I'm ready for action
Bumping Electric Relaxation what's happening?
What's with all the hating?

Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time
Dawg you got another square? Get the fuck up out of here
It's game time, it's game time

// Black //

Dawg you ain't know I'm on some other shit
Not like no nigga, I'm a psycho like no nigga
That don't keep no rifle nigga
Michael Tyson mind-frame when he won the title nigga
Knock out ya grill like you was chewin' loads of peanut brittle
Bitch look like she seen a whistle
Wanna' slurp and lick on me like I'm some sort of popsicle (popsicle)
Tickle me she said I look like Snoop Dizzle
Asked me if I wanted head I said "Fo' shizzle nizzle'
Back up on my grizzle grizzle, pistol and an instrumental
This a detrimental utter lack of fundamentals
You ain't never seen probation, you ain't never seen parole
I rock 'em, sock 'em robot nigga
Keep it moving, toe to toes, broke the mould, poke your holes
Poke your nose and polar flows
Twist a nigga leave him salty like a bag of Rold Gold
44 cold blows, all it took was low blows
Now a nigga fucked up morning toilet seat cold

Used to be fucked up rocks in dunta-dun-daduns
End of money credit living waiting on the first to come
Nigga I will run up on [?]
Now you got tubes in your mouth, Roger Troutman
Nigga you ain't got a choice, used to sound like Barry White
Now it's T-Pain voice
But where Berry Gordy used to crack the top 40's
Now we crack 40's telling yesterday's stories
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo, been on the Calico
In results of taddle-toe
Jump [?] from Mighty Joe
Hidey-hidey-hidey-ho
Cab Calloway ya ho
'Bout doe, if you ain't about money what you came for?
Surgery with chainsaws, nigga I will bang y'all
Catch a nigga Christmas Eve, head leaking Eggnog
Bite a nigga jaw off, while I got the sawed-off
Because you ass and pussy like a bitch with her drawers off

// LoL //

The present like December 25th
Getting cookies out the oven with the Louis V oven mitt
Sold work, now I'm working with the choruses
Professor X-Man would say I'm Vanglorious
Put patterns together with words I crochet
All-Madden with the flow, y'all so so gay like
Dance... dance revolution
I'm for the advance same as Kwame restitution
Eating good in the booth like wassup
Y'all in the booth sounding like potluck
We don't know what we gettin'
Brown like Pujols, always hittin'
Your bitch like a cue ball in a pool hall
We all hittin'
No kiddin', no bullshittin'
Pull my dick out and she just start lickin' like
That was her secret ambition
Put my dick on her nose now she look like Pippen

Niggas hit the text, say it's light on the scale
I text back LOL
Another nigga trippin', said he middleman his sales
I text back LOL
SMH, LMAO
Don't text Danny Brown if it ain't about dough
LOL, LOL
If it ain't about money, TTYL

Nigga hit me on the Sidekick saying he gon' shoot me
Sounding like a real groupie
He a bitch with a heater like Lara Croft
He gone get his ass wet like Noah's Ark
Got the chopper, won't hesitate to squeeze
Get his ass cut like a whopper with cheese
Give his ass some beats, no need for MPs
Now he's in the ER hooked to IVs
Doc saying that it's over
When I watched G.I. Joe, I used to root for Kobra
Used to watch Scarface and root for Sosa
And laugh myself to tears every time the movie's over
To me, that's the perfect endin'
All my niggas sinning for the rims that be spinnin'
And did I mention that jails to us like after school detention
So revolvers, we spin them
Text a nigga like, "Come through, end him"

Niggas hit the text, say it's light on the scale
I text back LOL
Another nigga trippin', said he middleman his sales
I text back LOL
SMH, LMAO
Don't text Danny Brown if it ain't about dough
LOL, LOL
If it ain't about money, TTYL

// On My Shit //

Yeah, you know I'm on that
You know what it is nigga
It's Danny Brown
Denmark Vessey what's good nigga, yeah
You know I'm on my shit right know, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's the hybrid, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the middle right now, feelin' myself, yeah

I fly like paper, I'm high like Louis luggage
Drunker than a motherfucker, overcoat Brook Brothers
Dog I'm on my shit, fresher than a motherfucker
Man I got a lot of kicks, way more than your older brother
Don't she suck a lot of dick? We call her the applepucker
When she bomb you up, look like she sippin' applepucker (applepucker?)
Applepucker, mixed with some vinegar
If that ain't fact, mister, that don't say sinister (sinister?)
Sinister, nigga we live by that
Nigga why you hatin' I could make your brain pop out that
Tiger fitted cap like a fuckin' toaster strudel
Man I peel yo' top like a cup of ramen noodles
I speak soft so the clothes look loud
And you might got swagger but you ain't got style
Don't rock bling bling, the bitches like, "wow"
Versace lookin new, I ain't worn this in a while

And I'm on that
You know I'm on that
On my shit, I'm on my shit

Yeah, it's true, it's true
Ain't that right
Nah

Long as the sun shine, the hybrid got rhymes
Used to have them trays like the school lunch lines
Gourmet rhymes, yours like school lunch
Drunk the bottle on my own just like can of punch [?]
At the school dance nigga Ima start a fight
You wanna pop yo ass and I'm fucking up yo night
Best dressed, class clown, nigga you a fool
This rap shit to me sorta light high school
Fuck the crack game if you ain't got muscle
Whoever said that, man they could not hustle
Around my hood, nigga what's good
Rep 48206 Linwood

// Bag Back //

I lived my whole life for a green piece of paper
Results of chasin' that
Raiders on respirators
Wanna make a deal?
Gotta talk to ya later
They say I'm immature like babies in incubators
Motherfuckers I'm a don
Hood phenomenon
Game so tight I can serve Farrakhan
A bacon double cheese burger, nigga that's unheard of
Koch that, pop that, you never heard of cause
I'm all about murder
Bloody bloody murder
Pound flipper, bitch getter, four clip inserter
Chase the thunder bread like Urkel did Laura
You get in my way and an oceano snorkel

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

I'm in the hood all day
Where the fuck are you niggas?
Glennwood stove
A loosie and two swishers
And what you don't know
I'm about to teach ya
For them Ben Franklin's niggas singin' like Aretha
Smokin' sour diesel with this bitch named Keyshia
So much lip gloss she fuckin' up the swisher
I'm a real nigga
And nigga you ain't
You a bitch ass nigga, nigga I ain't
Unforgivable
Nigga you bit the fo'
Give it to a nigga now he bleedin' like menstrual
Cycle, you might grow, shoot like Ivo
Monster and the letter man, Thriller like Michael

And I dog these hoes like a Georgetown Hoya
When I get locked you gotta talk to my lawyer
So be cool nigga, sit back, relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"
I just talked to him give him 15 minutes
So please have patience, dawg we gon' get it
So be cool nigga sit back relax
Don't worry that bag will be
"Back, back"

// Contra //

From the hood where them niggas pack fullys
Turn an ounce of reg to a cutty
Count money with a 10 deep flannel on
SB's lookin' like they been painted on
Jeans fittin' like they was made for me
Your pants lookin' like, they was hand-me-downs from your Daddy
Get at me, my fit worth a stacky
I'm in a caddy getting head in the back seat
Rubbin' on her yakki
Then it start rainin', when I start cummin'
So now I'm brainstorming, on how I'm gon' run it
And ya'll like fags, pussy you don't want it
Gosh darn it, got heat like furnace, and I raise it like thermostat
Rollin' that Thundercat kush look like Panthro
Heard you grab your ankles, take it in your manhole
That's so disgusting, I think I just threw up in my mouth
Can somebody pass me a towel?
A wetnap or something? Nigga is you frontin'?
I beat you in your face, now your head like a pumpkin
Jack-O-Lantern, I'm Danny Tanner
Watchin' that white girl, you a dry jheri curl
You worthless piece of shit
Your baby mama begged me to suck my dick
And I ain't gon' let her, she look like Predator
You a gay boy like David Archuleta
Contra, where niggas pierce armor
It's two niggas, two guns, blowin' out your conscience
You see them chrome fourty-fours, in this bitch with thirty men
Ya'll niggas know the code like...

Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A B A Select Start
Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A B A Select Start

Yo, when I write ya'll, I blackout like nightfall
I'm never shitted on like that blight stall, that's quite small
You wouldn't like me when I get gutter, it's the legit cutter
And you ain't sharp enough to split butter
I stack riches, throwin' niggas in black ditches
You wack bitches, while you mixed up like when the track switches
Hand on my nuts like my sac itches
Lookin' like The Mack, hitting 'lac switches
Hiding guns in my Abercrombie
With a dime piece, gettin' more brain than a zombie
Times 3, Ladies Love Cool J
I need a bitch with more class than a school day
I heard a fool say I wasn't in his top 3
Stepped off with a broke arm and a popped knee
See me & Brown is no regular team
We make the whole planet flip like Omega Supreme
Yeah, make 'em hype, yo I murder with this tight flow
You a typo, plus you suck like lypo
I keep bodies hid, fuck a John Gotti bid
Talk money, then we can chop it up like the Karate Kid
But don't think I won't clap and merk 'em
Infrared, beam 'em up, I will Captain Kirk 'em
And turn 'em to a brainless dodo
And break 'em both, legs one and two, like when Kane was solo
I'm snatchin' up his chains and Polo, the flow's fitted
To pose with it in the strangest photo
I'm bumpin' blue genie, if your stacks is too teeny
First you see me, and then you don't like I'm Houdini
Nigga

// Fruit Cocktail //

Tryna get high to forget that I'm broke
Tho it's high tide still gotta stay afloat
Sweater over hoodie used to be my winter coat
Dish detergent liquid when we ran out of soap
Walk in to the store plastic bag filled with bottles
Stolen basic cable on our ol' floor model
Check in the fridge, nothing to eat
Baby mama killing roaches with her bare feet
My nigga hit me off I fucked up the sack
Trip to Coney Island fucking with a hood rat
Now a nigga back, right where I started
Real true livin' definition of an artist
So now a nigga old but ain't shit changed
Hid this morning when the light people came
Now point me to heaven cause this sure is hell
Tell me what's the difference from being in a cell

Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

I got locked up, I came back home
Takin' county chances, just to keep my phone on
My baby mama trippin', that bitch don't even work
Stress a nigga out, got me payin' child support
I'm flirtin' with the Beam, I got a date with death
38 revolver, got two bullets left
Sometimes I daydream, about puttin' in myself
Runnin' up to heaven, trippin' up the steps
My nigga want a square, only got one left
So I'm a bust it down with you
If I had it dog, I'd blow a pound with you
My nigga understand, that's just how shit goes
That's why we get high, cause we feel so low
And tho we livin' fast, the money comin' slow
Got a lid up on my nigga, cause his time goin slow
Said a pray for him quick, fans gotta let him know

Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

Mama in the kitchen, scrapin' up a dinner
Daddy play the lottery, hope he got a winner
My brother on the block, tryna catch sales
Sister on the pole, shake her fruit cocktail

// Counterfeit //

I'm feelin' kinda sick
Shorty cause my last flip got hit with some counterfeit
Whole damn hundred
Must of been desperate
Be out here bein' greedy, so the line I didn't check it
So I'm sittin' in the spot
Countin' on my knot
Pistol on the flo' while I'm sittin' on the couch
Then I heard a knock
I know this bet' not
I was so damn excited I forgot to grab the Glock
Snatched open the do'
Gave my dawg the nod
And pieced his ass up while he was reachin' for that do' nob
Grabbed his head and kneed him in his chin
Put 'em in a headlock, kicked him in the shin
Got him on the ground
Hands on the throat
But guess what the fuck this nigga started reachin' fo'?
Lucky for me my nigga peeped him, changed the moment
Cause at that very point, shit went in slow motion
Picked up the heater
Cocked that bitch back
Squeezed two times saw a real bright flash
"Tat tat"
Then the fiend started screamin'
Ran out the apartment with his right calf leakin'
Then we chase after
Heater still smokin'
Caught him in the alley and let that bitch open
"Tat tat"
He squeezed two mo' at my man
And next thing we heard he gettin' picked up in an ambulance
Next day
Chillin' feelin' proper
We just smokin' some Mustafah
Hash in it, and we ain't even mention it
Around this time playin' 2K1
We were so young and dumb dawg we even kept the gun
And if we got caught dawg we would've got hung

// The Wizard //

[Sample from the motion picture The Wizard]

It ain't even a question will I pop off
Hot like the chicken of the grease with some hot sauce
Used to play the block with the Carhartt
For breakfast it was blunts, bout to get a couple Pop Tarts
Used to ride around with the heckler
Lil' nigga on his grind, Ryan Sheckler
Stash in the dresser
So fuck a school lecture
From professors
Like a teacher I test ya
Never smoke regular haze in a swisher
Runnin' through snow like blades in the winter
Now I treat beats like crack on broke mirrors
Slow like a gem star, nothings been delivered
And now you're all high
So you can thank I
Fuckin' with Brown cause I keep a good supply
I know a lot of fiends that say they can't cry
Cause they sniff so much that it dried out their eyes
And that's real shit

"They makin' money yo that shit is a waste"
"While you lames tryin' to stay in the game we playin' to win" - [Phat Kat 'Get It Started']
"Major players gettin' paper by the layers" - [Kool G Rap 'Fast Life']
"Sinnin' at the club in Detroit"
"Now that's game, now I hope y'all listen cause" - [Hot Rod 'Be Easy']
"Signed or unsigned, MC's get dealt with" - [Planet Asia 'Pure Coke']
"I've been too nice, too long"

You ain't gotta answer, "Am I real nigga?"
I was sellin' crack back when it was Tommy Hilfiger
Used to keep revolvers in the Nautica
Now I just send a text, niggas come through, offin' ya
Niggas blowin' horns at your burial
Choir singin' loud and in stereo
Your spirit's gone aerial
Your family will miss you
When we hit you
Real nigga saw the bitch in you
Different individual, not what you're used to
One Danny Brown equal the whole Juice Crew
Nigga you doo doo
We all can smell it
Chronic I smoke, I bail it then inhale it
Pint of gram brew got a nigga on loose
Shawty got a bubble and she said she comin' through
Bitches on my dick cause a nigga so fly
And I fuck so much when I nut my dick cry
And that's real shit

"They makin' money yo that shit is a waste"
"While you lames tryin' to stay in the game we playin' to win"
"Major players gettin' paper by the layers"
"Sinnin' at the club in Detroit"
"Now that's game, now I hope y'all listen cause"
"Signed or unsigned, MC's get dealt with"
"I've been too nice, too long"
