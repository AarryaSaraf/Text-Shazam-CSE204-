Album: TESTING

// Distorted Records //

I can feel the bass, from the ceiling to the basement
I don't feel a thing, get the fuck up out my face, bitch
I don't feel a thing, yeah I'm faded, yeah I'm shaded
I don't feel a thing, I can feel the bass, I can feel the bass

Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records
(What more distorted records do you have?)

First things first, I done heard the worst things
Like if I'm in your top 10, mine's better be the first name
Out your mouth, ain't even worth saying
Little niggas is my offsprings

They deserve a nigga first name, middle name, surname
From another planet, birthplace, Cloud 9, hello earthlings
My newest President an asshole

I guess that's why I'm leaving turd stains
My ex used to chill with bad tings
All they talked about was bird things
Tried to put them on to Bad Brains

But bird hoes got the bird brains
Everything I do groundbreak
Big body make the floor break
Big bass make the world shake
Flacko out here causin' earthquakes, uh

Uh, I can feel the bass, uh, I can see the fakes
Word to T.D. Jakes, uh, word to Pastor Ma$e and Kirk Franklin
Fuck what niggas think, I'm about the bank
Comma, dollar signs, I'm about my Franklins
I can feel the bass

Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records

// Fukk Sleep //

[FKA twigs]
Oh, yeah, ah-ah

[A$AP Rocky & FKA twigs]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it (Oh, yeah)
Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, CÃ©line, Tiffany, she flossy (Oh)

Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (Brrr)

Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)

Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

[A$AP Rocky:]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

[A$AP Rocky, FKA twigs:]
I remember I was poor and
When I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens
Eyes lookin' like he rollin'

Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags

Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (Sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "Son, you the boss" (Ah)
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment (Ah)
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen

[A$AP Rocky:]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

[FKA Twigs:]
They called me a witch, burned me like saffron
My matter is golden
A child of the Odyssey
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden

He told me when I'm present, chosen
So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden

[A$AP Rocky and FKA twigs:]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
(Golden)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going (Ahh, yeah)
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies

// Praise The Lord (Da Shine) //

[A$AP Rocky:]
Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans

Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded
Diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open

Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs

The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine

I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze

I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[A$AP Rocky & Skepta:]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain

They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage

My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

[Skepta:]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays

We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues

Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but

I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[French Montana:]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P

Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you

Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'

Still, I smile
The kids will be alright, just fine

All the colors are alive
No longer black or white, ahh

Uh, kiss the kids, call your baby daddy
Tell 'em who's daddy
Call your pappy, tell him that you happy
Shout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly
Inside sunny energize
Think about it like you feelin' alive
On the mama boy, she swear to God

Lady said that she ain't into guys
Brand new 'cedes with the intercom
Table made is for the dinner vibe
Ain't a killer so don't kill the vibe
Disrespect them, that's a different side
Adderall and alcohol (yeah)
The teachers called, the doctor called

The block too hot, the marshall called
See 'em grow and watch 'em crawl

Parents test the wine
The kids do the lines
Ahh, alright
Ahh, just fine
The kids turned out fine
The kids turned and run
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind

All year long bruh, stuck up in my zone all by my lonesome
Pay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war, I brought my own gun
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome

Nigga say I switched up like I'm on some
Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out, couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days
143rd in front on Minisink, Cam'ron had us wearing pink

From the cradle to the grave, put in work
Hustled 'round the corner where my nana stay, couldn't work
Open up shop in front the corner store, make 'em renovate
Where the killers stand, fuck a lemonade
But they cook it by the Minute Maid
Couple niggas hate

[A$AP Rocky:]
With my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball

Never had a job, but I kept a broad
When I went in Saks, went and copped it all
My cougars had me lit, kept a PYT

Your mama on my dick, prettier than a bitch
And I'm overseas, and I had a ball
Seein' overseas hoes (Really litty lit, uh)

Where your hoes? Why your chain don't spin?
Light them up, really like 'em all
Nigga like it all, nigga like it, tell her get like me

// Changes //

[Part I]

[ASAP Rocky & MGMT:]
Changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Always changin' faces
I'm goin' through phases
I'm goin' through changes
Changes
I'm goin' through changes
All those changin' faces
I'm goin' through phases

[A$AP Rocky:]
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me

Love comes with a price tag and a barcode
Still love you when we part though
Blame me like it's my fault
Still o-, still okay
Walk around like your heart cold
Hop around like your parkour

Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay (changes)
Still o-, still o-

[A$AP Rocky & DevontÃ© Hynes:]
Look, I got a text from this girl I used to see
Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"

Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (Feel it)
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' (Livin')
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'

Like fuck all the other tenants (Runnin')
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' (Runnin')
Rich niggas in their feelings (Runnin')
Bitch niggas in their feelings (Woo)
Bags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home
They ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more
I was on the road on tour (Tour)
She just said I changed for the worst (She just said I changed)
Rain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, I guess you need it more

[A$AP Rocky and MGMT:]
I'm going through changes
Sweetest smile
Always changing phases
Upside down
I'm going through phases
I'll be cruel to you
I'm going through changes
Don't know if you love me or not

[Part II]

[A$AP Rocky:]
These ain't monkey bars from no fuckin' kiddy parks
Itchin' with the chicky pox, nigga
Shittin' on 'em, need my litty box
Mink on, see the fox

(Oh, that's how you feel, nigga)
'03 Bentley Park, by the candy shop, Vicky, Vicky Fox
Time to give them what they want
Rakim Allah mixed with Biggie, Pac

Weird nigga from the block, ugh
Square bitches give me box, ugh
She pussy pop to Iggy Pop
You pussy niggas really pop

[A$AP Rocky & DevontÃ© Hynes:]
Thanks for the light, waitin' for the light
Changes
Change for a lifetime (What a wonderful life)
Thanks for the night, drinks for the night
Changes
Waitin' for the right time (What a wonderful life)
(Changed for the better changed for the worse)
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes

[Part III]

[A$AP Rocky:]
My biggest distraction is that I get distracted
People suing me for shit that didn't happen
I wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me
(Fuck this shit)
Wake up to my explore page
See my exes engaged, or either gettin' married
Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months, post-natal, postin' up that little nigga papi
I wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me

[A$AP Rocky & MGMT:]
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I've seen her, she can feel a change in me

[A$AP Rocky:]
Changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changes

Stuck with bros, stuck the code (Yeah)
'Cede emblem on the fender (Yeah, yeah)
Couple fans in the hood I got no choice but to vent
Going in front to back

Know when that ring involved, know that it married (Yeah)
Fuck views and opinions

But when I'm inside pretendin' to smile
I feel the same high from the vengeance (Check it out)

Goodbye to the correct way
The picket fences, kids in the kitchen
Stuck in this world, I feel lost
I'm feelin' trapped in my thoughts (Yeah)
I don't know who to trust (Yeah)
Just got my word and my balls (Yeah)

This is hell in a hole
I know this the life that we chose

Save me the tux
Save me the tux for the endin' (Save me the tux, save me)
Endin'

// Purity //

[A$AP Rocky:]
I've been busy (Busy, busy)
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute (Hold on)

[Lauryn Hill, A$AP Rocky, and Frank Ocean:]
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(Ooh, going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(I'm going to find)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(Yeah)

[Frank Ocean:]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure

Born before the virus was cured
Pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford

Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the FÃ¼hrer

I rewind, Nas track 6
Rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me

Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'

Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woofâdogs in the place, loose toothâlost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, BrÃ¼t champagne

Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep

I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P

Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth
Chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you're overthinkin'

One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

[Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and A$AP Rocky:]
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(Oh, oh)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(You make my desire pure)
"I gotta find peace of mind"
(You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"

[A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill:]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab

"I'm undone because"

Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold thatâ) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough
Tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro
Ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool

Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like

"I'm undone because"

Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief
I share with you my peace

[Lauryn Hill:]
"I'm undone becauseâ"
"I'm undone becauseâ"
