Album: LongLiveAap

// Long Live A$ap //

I thought I'd probably die in prison
Expensive taste in women

Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision

This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis

A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition

For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans

Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

Riding through your city like that motherfucker mine
Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine

Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)

Cause there's killers in my town (Uh)
Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)

Corrupted little minds (Yeah)
8 and 9, finna shine (Yeah)
On the grind
Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya (Uh)
Where they shoot without a purpose

Services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it
Can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, RIP to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live

Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Oh, yeah, oh, right
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off (Right, right)

// PMW (All I Really Need) //

[A$AP Rocky:]
All I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

[Schoolboy Q:]
It's A$AP Q, where the bread at?
Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungee cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80
Turn a baby into a lady, now here go the keys to my new Mercedes
Cause shawty she a stripper, all you got to do is tip her
She like ballers with some money screaming fuck them other niggas
Now do A through Z for a G, panties go down to her feet
Pussy get wetter for me, smackin' that ass to the beat, give her that Diggity-D

How 'bout me and you and you and I
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on

So I say pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
Pussy, money, weed
That's all a nigga need

Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag

Get the news flash, that the truth back

Nigga make way for the new jacks

Yea, uh

It's Mr. Pistol Popper screaming, "Fuck a copper"
I just bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck your block up, blocka!
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hating
I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch, I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, "Where the cash at?"
I see dead people, I need dead people
Lord Pretty Flacko, bitch, I behead people
Kneel and kiss the ring, all hail the King
Long Live A$AP put that on everything

[Haim:]
Alright, mothafucka
Alright, A$AP

All you need is love

// Hell //

[ASAP Rocky:]
Uh, uh

We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules, I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun, then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swaggin' in philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting, yeah, I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze (Achoo)
There your reasons go, bitch
I got some tissues for your issues, tell 'em blow this
Bitch!

[Santigold:]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?

[ASAP Rocky:]
Roger, Roger, tell 'em roger that (It will hit you on the head)
It's the gold teeth, French braids, call me Project Pat (You don't even gotta hate me now babe)
With the stocking cap, Jason mask on, probably strapped (Just as sheeps get led, ohh)
It's the Rocky cat, turn my swag on, holla back (You could see where I'm going, ohh)
Throw a dollar at a bidd-itch, tell 'er suck my di-dick
Cause they hatin' on my clid-dick
Cause we made it when we did it, hate it cause they didn't
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, hoopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin' like a drippin' smoothy, no coaster
The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers
Cuz Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title
For now I'm po-pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

[Santigold:]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down, waitin' on me long
You know your way? Where you headin' now?
Me I want everything (Bitch!) it won't take me long
Make my money, walk straight ahead now

You don't even gotta hate me now babe
Just as sheeps get led, ohh

You know your way? Where you headin' now?

// Pain //

Uh, pain

[A$AP Rocky:]
So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around

It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action

Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (You love, you love it)

The future will be televised, haters getting genocide
23 and 43, I'm talking my Margiela size
My niggas is hella fly, you over accessorize
Dead alive, it's in my repertoire, forever ever high
I never lie, never tell a lie, I would testify
Set aside dreams, I'm a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced, fat ass, and a nice set of thighs
Rihanna weave, I need a umbrella, ella, ella, ah

[Kent Jamz:]
Everybody knows me, shit, still ain't got no cash
Bitch, hit that flash quick, post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram, match a gram, Mando
Royal blue Foams, getting head in the red Lambo
Media take me out, TMZ all in the V.I.P
Bitch I'm hard and my Loop Concrete
Too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame, but she came with money
I got two bad bitches, haters wanna take 'em from me

It was a lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action
Lights, camera, action, lights, camera, action (you love, you love it)
Lights, camera, act-, light, lights, camera, action

[Tube:]
Tryna get on in this industry, acting like you're (Ruthy)
Breaking down cocaine with the EBT (Oh yeah)
These male groupies doin' it however
Whatever they seein' on the box
Everybody spit, everybody hot
Everybody's an artist (Everybody not)
S-O L-O-S-T, niggas talking dollars, getting change
In a minute I'ma lose my cool, Sprewell one year before '98
Like fuck coach, I'm cutthroat, so what goes
Do you have for the year they say might be the end?
Better look within

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, glitz and the glamors, we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me, they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me, pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry, get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper, that Bathing Ape camouflage
Brands from Japan, you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants, bitch it's Hammer time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Li-life is what you need, won't you take a Z? Feel the breeze
Smoke the Sour Diese', hit that shit and please, act at ease
What you wanna be, like? The Black Eyed Peas, all these steezs
S-T-A-R-S, Hollywood, won't you rest in peace?

So big you are, shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground, back against the wall
Tell me who you call, when no one else around

Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'

// Wild For The Night //

Wake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I â my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy, I'm a block boy, I'm a D boy, I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy
Drunk as fuck, and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night, fuck being polite, boy

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends-es
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es

Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep, and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack, it's a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Ou-Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies, tell 'em where we goin'

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

// 1 Train //

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyarâ
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Joey Bada$$:]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Yelawolf:]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' upâwait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella showâYelawolf

[Danny Brown:]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Action Bronson:]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

[Big K.R.I.T.:]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, "How you ask for that?"
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist

Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan

// Suddenly //

I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it

I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly

It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$AP

// Jodye //

Bitch motherfuckers trying to fake it trill
Sneak diss you just to make a bill
Now the world won't take you serious
When I met you, you was painting nails
Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course, you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my niggas
I'll die for my niggas, man, fuck them other niggas!

Lord, please talk to me Lord
I am here for you Lord

Gettin' faded, hair gettin' braided, Sophie sniffed a line of ye
Playin' spades, bumpin' Jimi Hendrix "Purple Haze"
A 40 to the face, call my homies from around the way
Give me that pussy, I'll be on my way
But grab the Jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me
Pretty nigga, I'm a jiggy nigga, ask about me
Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

Let the Lords toast with the Lords
Toast to the Lords
When come gods, come Lords
Lords! Lords! Lords!
Oh, Lord! Toast to the Lords!
As we live this day, please pray for us
When comes the saints, comes the evils, brings the Lords

Whip-whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (Uh)
Before I get aggressive forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (Uh)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll-rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports (Uh)

Since Rocky spit like AndrÃ©
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrÃ©e
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a 9?
Damn, look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga

// I Come Apart //

[A$AP Rocky:]
I thought you said you'd never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back, ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

[Florence Welch:]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever

[A$AP Rocky:]
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured

[Florence Welch:]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever

You're the eye, but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

[A$AP Rocky:]
You made a bet with me, now you're in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It's ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I'm in her heart on her left titty

[Florence Welch:]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can't last forever
Can't last forever

Stack a lot of bands and I serve a lot of grams (Skrt!)
Thirty-six O's, stamped with the dragon
Brick Squad, Bird Gang, yeah, we got them Falcons (Skrt!)

[A$AP Rocky & Pharrell:]
If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up (Skateboard)
If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch, get your mothafuckin' hands up (Ya heard?)
I rock Chanel nigga, and BAPE fish lures
If you a trill bitch, get your mothafuckin' hands up

[Pharrell Williams:]
Your girl hold my dick like a Wii controller
Where's your bitch, nigga? We control her
The weed, she holding while she be over
And when she saw my mothafuckin' keys, it's over
And when I start it up, she like, "Lean me over"
Cold heart, warm dick, momma, we be polar
I wore Louboutins before they knew what they was
They like, "Louis Vuitton? Naw, uh-uh, cuz"
That's when I realized they didn't know what they was
Them niggas act like I fuckin' stepped in blood
'07 to '11, man, I put out duds
And ate space cakes that was filled with bud
And now 2012, nigga, look at these Scuds
Green hair, money on my mind, hip-hop grunge
You wear a cross, I wear a Cartier nail
You niggas ain't fuckin' with Ph'rell
My wrist sizzle hot like it's stuck in the chair
My jewelry's so loud, it's got something to share
Like a conspiracy, like it's ACHAP
Everybody on my dick like Ahab
Wait, did I say that? First, pause, then play back
Recognize nigga, A$AP

[A$AP Rocky:]
If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up
If you a trill nigga, get your mothafuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch, get your mothafuckin' hands up
If you a trill bitch, get your mothafuckin' hands up
