// Been Around The World //

Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not 'cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
You're crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck, you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not 'cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along, forever making scenes
You're crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this surprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high 'cause you like my drift
She know how I do it 'cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter 'cause I'm pimping bitch until the end

'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, 'cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

// New York Bittersweet Symphony //

Yeah this is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it

Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm Tryna fly to the stars
Smooth on the moon and I be mobbing to mars
Niggas say I'm ill, y'all ain't telling me shit
Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic

If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace

// Purple Swag //

Smoke, Ty Beats
Better do it 'til we get right, uhh

This is for my niggas getting high on the regular
This is for my bitches getting high on the regular

Purple drink, I still sip, purple weed blunt still lit
Real nigga, real bitch, purple swag, that trill shit
Them candy cars, I'm coming down, that paint drip, I still tip
That pimp shit, she ain't plan to fuck, I pick up, I still hit
That's swag, bitch

Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing steel, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me coming
Robitussin, quit discussing, ASAP tell these niggas something, swag

Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

// Get High //

[A$AP Rocky:]
Hey lady, got something for you to buy now
Something cool, something new, something for you to try now
I know you feel alone, but I'm gon' get you high now
Now that you high, take your clothes off, and lie down

We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

[A$AP Ferg:]
Come, listen, yeah I can be your E-pill
Better yet your He-pill, when it come to tricking D-pills
She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle
She need ill, to stay alive, keep my crack in between her thighs
When she smoke she feel her high, delicate enough to make her cry
(I think she need new lungs, cause my bitch she get)

We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

[A$AP Rocky:]
I can be your pusher, know you need your pusher
Get it how live it when you know you need the hook up
I can get it cook up, know I got you shook up, ooh
I'm your pusher, but I don't be on no corners
Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia
O.D. and fuck around and slip into a coma

We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high (She said)
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping

// Uptown //

[A$AP Rocky:]

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[A$AP Rocky:]
A$AP, where my crew at
Swag so sick where the birds caught the flu at
All the hoes know me, don't need to ask, "Who that?"
Or where the heat at, my nigga, 'cause we do that
And pistol popping get it popping, niggas better move that
Cause we get a Glock and with the stock and he ain't scared to shoot it like
4 G's: blew that, G4: flew that
I'm the shit, you must admit, true that
Yeah I'm so uptown
Niggas know we get it for the low uptown
Uh gold, got 'dro, got snow uptown
Bitch-shit niggas scared to go uptown
Money making Manhattan, whip game proper
Them might be the product of the locker
A$AP, know I'm gonna prosper
Don't care, cause I'm only straight as my posture

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[A$AP Nast:]
Boom, nigga, Nast in the house
Flow like a drug, pass it around
Fag, you're a doubt, what you rapping about?
A$AP nigga, trash on the couch
Glass to the mouth, Patr√≥n in the system
Tool on the waist just in case I gotta fix 'em
Bullets like fiends just dying to hit them
Nigga did I mention, swag house nigga
Get slapped in your shit if you badmouth nigga
Left the Range in the garage and brought the Jag out, nigga
Nast be the shit that you brag about, nigga
I ain't even tryna hear about your hereabouts, nigga
Weird-ass nigga, scared-ass nigga
I'm done with this track, did you hear that, nigga? (What?)
[?] and I did wrap niggas
Try to step on my throne?
Bitch, this is my home

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

[A$AP Twelvyy:]
I'm a uptown blood slime, balling's in my blood line
Pants sagging real low, I'm running from the one time
Free Church boy, yeah, my nigga caught a gun crime
Mobbing on Lenox and I'm grinding 'til the sunrise
I'm really getting dope, boy, free my nigga Dough boy
Catch me on Broadway, we got it for the low, boy
And I got flow, boy, in other words, hoes, boy
Body after body, yeah, you already know boy
I'm bumping "Oh Boy", classic Harlem shit
True Religion, who you kidding? Nigga started this
Young Twelv' get it gang, got the hardest shit
Polo down to the socks, looking marvelous
I'm from the home of the free S
I'm Grade on the West like I'm Gucci on the ES
Aura like GS, stepping out the GX
A$AP up, y'all niggas kill me with the BS... P.S.:

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm so uptown
And mothafucka if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah

// Grown Up //

Uh alright, (Alright)
(Maybach music)
Uh, uh, uh
A$AP

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure enough, sipping on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah, I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my visions on a blimp
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are the breaks
My Christian Louboutins got nails, give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision, I'm grown

I don't do kid stuff much
Niggas say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up, tough luck

[Seth Narley:]
Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Picture this: being 21 with a gift
Bamas don't understand how I'm swift
Or I'm MJ-nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, little homie, that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa, and all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink
I'm dreamin all this within, Young Leo, Inception
Come again? No offense
But fuck whoever said wearing slims was a trend
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
All grown up, nothing like before

// Been Around The World (Chopped & Screwed) //

Yeah, last track on the mixtape
'Preciate everybody listening, you know what I'm talkin' bout?
And we'll see you on the next one, you know what I'm talkin bout?

Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me

Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean

'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me

Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimping bitch until the end
