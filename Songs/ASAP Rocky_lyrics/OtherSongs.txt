// A$AP Forever //

[A$AP Rocky:]
Gang! Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang! They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang!
They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans

Gang! Gang!
Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game!

Come fuck with the Mob
Shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi

My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms

Margiela Madman
With cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiÃ³s, vÃ¡monos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plÃ¡tanos

Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains

I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back

Gang! Gang!
Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)

[A$AP Rocky + Khloe Anna:]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame

But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

[Khloe Anna + Moby:]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie

// Above //

Walls slowly closin' in
I feel the time slowly runnin' out
I think my mind slowly losin' focus
Lately I've been through the motions
I'm on another level this time
Levels in my bezel, rich time
They ain't on my level this time
Think it's time we settle this right now

And if I keep goin' back to fuckin' with her, with her
I'ma end up with her, oh
Always first to finish last, time to quit her, quit her
Time to give up, bitter, oh

This time, I'm...
This time...
I'm your first, I'm your last
I'm the best thing that you've ever had
This time...
This time...
Last time...
I'm the best of all time

Uh
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes

Baked potato on that Draco, new bandana on my face
Ain't no stains up on my drapes, squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, no dentures please
Princess cut, no dentist, please

Say cheese for the cameras (Ayy)
Eight Gs for the dancers (Ayy)
Benjis in the safe (That's right, ayy)

Bentleys for the phantoms (Uh)
But they all go to waste (Uh)
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace

The scar on my face
But w-wait
(EcafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)
The world is yours, Scarface, nigga
(EcafracS ,sruoy si dlrow ehT)

I ain't duckin' niggas, I ain't duckin' bullets either
Shit, I ain't duck sauce since I became a vegan
Nigga, Flacko Jodye season
Prada pants before the season

Probably ducked off in a quiet place wit' ya breezy
Prada shades, that's probably why you couldn't see him
Shittin' me? (Boy)

I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars on the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

Uh, fuck no, this ain't no hookah
Smokin' while I'm strollin' down Wooster

Buck fifty, my babushka

No pistol poppers and prostituters
Card scammers and the Prada boosters
Low top, yeah, the powder blue ones

Robber too, huh? Power to ya
Hallelujah, better pray to God

I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate this
To the scar on my face
Many stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

Uh, pearls and diamonds, that's excessive
Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes
Pearls and diamonds, that's excessive

Money, power, that's excessive
Money problems, that's expected
Marijuana, ass, and breastes

// Back To The Future //

Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I'm hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we've been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I'm her drug and she get high off me
Now I'm back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly

Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future's always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

Back through the door, back from the store
Back to the wall with my back to the wall
Rollin' up a blunt, passing it off
Ass on the floor, cash back on the floor
Mack with the broads, chat to the whores
"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I'm back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past

Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future's always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

// Bad Company //

[A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna:]
People think you're stuck up, but we're all super good friends
It's only natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends
Um, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um
I'm above average

[A$AP Rocky:]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

Bad company's bad for your company
Bad company's bad for your company
Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me

[A$AP Rocky & BlocBoy JB:]
When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad

Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc (Brrr), "yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app"

[BlockBoy JB:]
I need money and company, nah nah
Bad bitches, I don't even know the company, hahahaha
Youâyouâyou can't hang baby, we don't want you 'round here
Iâice on my neck and it's froze, Santa's reindeer

Yâyou got bad bitches, hella hoes, Iâiâit's the same here
You bad company, lil' bro, you can't hang here
Gâgâgâgettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'
Phâphâphoâphoâphone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'
Thaâthaâthat nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money
Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'

Whyâwhy these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches

[A$AP Rocky:]
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?

Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees

Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me
I'ma come clean, I got hella beef

Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze

I'm above average

[Gucci Mane & 21 Savage:]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky

[21 Savage & A$AP Rocky:]
I got so many M's in my bank account, I can't even count 'em
Too many whips, way I switch my car, I can't even mount 'em
Too many zeros with Versace pillows in my Phantoms

Too many bad bitches, I don't cuff 'em, I just hand them (21)
Off like a lay-up (lay-up), I don't got time to lay up
Met my accountant at Ruth's Chris, she told me that I'm way up (21)
I already back for seconds, I ain't even clean my plate up
Ran me up a hunned M's and then I put my bay up (21)
Way out in the hills, I just sign the deal
I ain't take no advance, so you know that split was real (21)
All my diamonds carats, them lil' pointers be too lil'
Glaciers in my ear, I need a cup, they 'bout to spill (Uh)

[Gucci Mane:]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky

[A$AP Rocky:]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I feel like I'm Rocky
Huh?
How you gon' play D? Can't even take D
Too many fake me's
Way too many fake daps, way too many fake '$APs
And I put it on me and I want another ring
Girlies buckle at the knees, swerve 'em like the other team (Skrrt)
You can still hear the sneaks (Woo, swoosh)
Ballin' in some Dungarees
Make a cheerleader cream, so what she on the other team?
For the cameras say your cheese, rap game like the league
Heard you the nigga overseas, but that's only overseas
I'm the one who oversees shit, "Oh man, it's him again"
I'm up in the rim, Gatorade and M&M's
Ball on you in my favorite Timberlands
My girlfriend got a little friend
All the way on the other end
'Cause she don't deal with the middle man
Harlem world stole my flow, friends and my foes
Got my hoes in my clothes, they want ten like my toes (A$AP)

[Gucci Mane:]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby , I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky (Yeah)

Just pass me the rock and watch him go
Just run me the play and let me know
With a broken leg, I let it go (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know (Woo)

[Gucci Mane:]
Gucci is materialistic, he's too fuckin' flashy
He smoke when he wanna smoke, think the world is his ashtray
So, so deaf to these suckers, I'm like JD in '03

My ho said that I'm too cocky, I don't play nothin' but me
These girls got nothing to show you, I'll give you something to see
These dudes keep comin' up short like they a pair of capris
Don't group me with these rappers, these boys embarrassin' me
Them dudes ain't got nothin' on me, I got a money disease
I'm too cold for these suckers, they ain't got more money than me
I wear my mink in the summer when it's a hundred and three (Burr)

I make a bitch feel self-conscious like she too shiny for me
I know that bitch want to fuck me, but she's too tiny for me
It's my way or the highway, you either like or leave
This Rollie cost us the G's, a couple bricks on my sleeve (Yeah)
When I first fell on the scene, I drove a Cutlass Supreme
A half a brick, a pint of lean, and a new money machine
It's Wop

Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky (It's Gucci)
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky (Wizop)
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky (Damn)

We got London On Da Track

Bad girls wanna have fun
I don't want no goodie two-shoes, no nun
I ain't no priest, I ain't gon' preach
I don't want no goodie-goodie, but she still praise Jesus

I share my clothes with my bitch like she my sis
I don't beat my bitch, I need my bitch
She clean my crib, she feed my friends
She keep my secret, she keep my fridge packed, my freezer lit
That's how deep I get, negative degrees

She got big accounts, too
With big amounts, shit you couldn't count
Just pick a number that you couldn't count to
Like her atitude, curve a nigga when she didn't have to
Around the the Lords like the British Council
With all these sticks around you
We could build you a wooden castle
Got a penthouse, see the Bronx zoo
Got a townhouse with a town view
Got surround sound with the top down
Run Allerton up to Soundview
I was lost then, but I found you
Little slim thick with a bounce, too
It's your tough love that I'm bound to
I fuck it up then it's round two

Electric charges flowin' through your fingertips
When your hands on my thighs

Do you feel this energy when I'm near you?
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?

Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see

Energy undeniable
Chemistry so reliable
Memories reifiable
Match lit, don't forget the lighter fluid
I just pray my heart is fireproof
Got thick skin 'cause it's bulletproof
And you sendin' shots 'cause you vulnerable
Like I'm tired of fightin', shit, let's call a trucee
I'm just tryna get back on your good side
Stay on the right path full time
Watch for the camera now, big smiles
Bad boys wanna have a good time
Plans made in advance
Let's make some babies, that makes us parents
Nah, Im just playin', ain't it apparent?
Make no mistake, I'd impregnate if I had the chance

As I maneuver through the streets
A policeman and then they seize bodies of those who disagree
(Like, fuck them all)
I pray the soldiers get release
The price of grief wasn't cheap
Hoped you kept to your receipts
Where there's beef
On the side of the feast, I'm a beast
Said it's me now, hold your peace
Don't hold your breath
Load your piece
And then squeeze
Then release
(Hail Mary)
Rest in peace
No relief
And that's why
The fucking martian to the fucking fucking, nigga

And force apart his ligaments
Be sure to wipe your fingerprints
Restore back to your innocence
And reminiscing ever since you feel the sentencing before the sentence ended
I'm in the slums my nigga
Not just for bragging
I'm in the field my nigga
This shit for practice
This shit is trill my nigga
Kill or be killed my nigga
Cops is killing children
Get off, only get suspension
Man, this shit's suspicious
Consequences never in this
Fur these fucking pigs and dirty politicians
Dirty money, wash the business
It's them early birds that'll prolly get it
Pull up on you, shut up
Shut the fuck up
Learn how to run or mind your business

Rental cars, hop out of it
RIP to the opposites

[A$AP Rocky:]
To the hating hoes, tell 'em ride a dick
White hoes love chocolate

// Hear Me //

[A$AP Rocky:]
First of all, I would like to start by saying
I'm the motherfucking man, just thought I'd let you niggas know, hear me?
If the shit hit the fan and these rappers start
The pen coming at you niggas' throats, hear me?
Do it big out in Cannes
At the film festival, nigga, every year I go, hear me?
Big dick, that's my man
Keep forty bitches round, bring 'em everywhere I go
Hear me? Hear me? Chilling on a boat
In the south of France, island happened off the coast
Saint Tropez when I'm waving to the folks
Got the young trap lord with me looking like the Pope, hear me?
Grew up living broke
Before we'd seen it all, niggas had to dream it all

Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they feel me
They don't feel me but they feel me, they hear me

[A$AP Rocky & Pharrell:]
Hear me?
Young niggas doing what it takes to survive
Hear me?
Young niggas only pay attention if it's fly
Hear me?
All I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive
Hear me?
If they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side
Hear me?

[A$AP Rocky:]
Black dark shades, black leather jacket
Bad chick on my arm got me looking like The Fonz, hear me?
We the champions and about to get a ring same size as LeBron's, hear me? Hear me?
Yeah, life is a bitch and it's no holds barred, every man for themselves, hear me? Hear me?
And if you ain't a man and your name ain't Solange
Keep your hands to yourself, hear me?
But I don't know them grown folks' business
The thoughts that they plant like it's photosynthe-sis
In your bits, put their nose all in it
I bring 'em to the light with my photogenics
Hear me? Fuck all those critics
If Flacko on the booth, that mean a killer on the loose, ooh
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they feel me
They don't feel me but they fear me, they hear me

Hear me? Hear me?
Young niggas doing what it takes to survive
Hear me? Hear me?
Young niggas only pay attention if it's fly
Hear me? Hear me?
All I ever hope to do is prosper when I strive
Hear me?
If they ain't playing in the game then they hating on the side

Uh, third verse, turn to third gear
I left a couple things out like the third wheel
These niggas lying on tracks without a third rail
Cause yeah, I'm only stating facts when I'm saying on wax
In your ear like I'm cleaning out the wax
They don't hear me like they're deaf, "it was wack", was dirt there?
Hear me? Yes, I gotta talk about the trap
Matter of fact, let me talk about rap cause I've served here
Yeah, hear me? Hear me?
Man, fuck the bullshit cause now I'm in my zone, hear me? Hear me?
I hear the same bullshit in every other song, hear me?
So I try to give 'em something different, listen when I'm on, hear me? Hear me?
Saddest thing about it is they only pay attention and they miss you when you're gone, hear me? Hear me?

Herojuana blunts
Cocaine up in her veins

Smokin' blunts, rollin' paper planes

Uh, I'm the nigga, jump up out the Porsche
Lil' nigga wearin' big shorts, playin' sports
Uh, all up on my court, uh, Porsche
What I thought up in my thoughts
Now I rolled up and boarded, I'm a boss, yes
Niggas know they lost, in the sauce, why you forfeit?
And you know it's ours, it's legit, I'm the toilet bowl
Cocaine up in her veins
Actin' strange, she do it and they smokin' Mary Jane
Herojuana blunts, nigga
I ain't never flexin', never stuntin'
Cocaine up in herâ
Cocaine up in her veins, watch her do her dance
Twenty thousand dollars, what you want?
A whole kilo, a brick-uh, a shit-uh
She took a, a sniff-uh, a quickie, a hit-uh
Her favorite, want to be her, her liquor
I seen her, a twister, I'm in her, I'm in her
I mean she dancin' like cocaine up in her veins
Watch her actin' strange
Vampire teeth, you should see her golden fangs
Cocaine up in her veins, while she gettin' brains
Sniff a line up on my dick
Herojuana blunts, nigga, I ain't never stunt
Herojuana blunts, twenty thousand dollars, what you want?
Cocaine up in her veins

Ain't a damn thing changed
Gettin' faded on the tame
Gettin' faded off the thing, yeah

Don't take drugs

Yes, mother!

// In Distress //

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the God in me, no telling what I'mma be

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

I foresee the jealousy all in your eyes for sure
Sure, they don't want to beef with my physique or my .44

Sure, life is sweet, I'm by the beach, sand all on the feet
By the seat, the time we meet, we'll leave em' by the shore

Waiting for her to get left
On the same place, dead bodies get left on
But woke niggas get slept on

Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose

Marble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Play that French Montana song, the one with Ross (Haaan!)
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store

Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls

Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke

My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams

Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my hand

Yo, listen

Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs

I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses

Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris

[A$AP Rocky:]
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers

In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze

But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food

That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel

Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?

I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge

I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed

But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahaha, yeah!

K shiz, what up, nigga!

// Pussy, Money, Weed //

All I think about is life, nights, sippin' on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little arguments in the fist, don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R Kelly hoes gettin' pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice
Young nigga cold like he sit on ice
Fuck broke, tryin' to be rich all life
I could've been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hangin', my top back
Hoes screamin' that Pac back
Throwin' Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, gotta Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all in my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white, but my cock black
Purple drink, got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk somethin'
Bounce on me, bitch, hurt somethin'
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth somethin'
So shawty, she a stunna and daddy, he a runna
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shakin' it fast and then makin' the stacks
And I'm takin' it back and I'm takin' her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kickin' her out

How 'bout me and you, and you and her
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
So I say

Pussy, money, weed (Yeah)

Uh, smokin' out, pourin' up
Purple drink up in my cup
Bitches actin' Hollywood
In my hood they wanna fuck
Purple stuff, yellow tuss
Yellow stuff look like a bus
She look like the type to front
But most likely the type to fuck
Make a buck, catch a nut
This shit be that trill livin'
Show you how the trill get it
Nigga, Pimp C gone, but he still livin'
Cause I'm still sippin' and my grill's glistenin'
Got me gold grills, shinin' and I'm still tippin'
Cause I'm still pimpin', but it feel different
Cause it's trill pimpin', nigga deal with it
That's all a nigga need, that's all a nigga need
Got a bitch up on my shoulder, got another on my sleeve
I said these bitches know my steeze
WV's, weak in the knees
Got them bitches movin' them keys
Rollin' the weed, duckin' them G's
Got a bad bitch from Belize, another overseas
If she don't wear no weave, then her hair down to her knees
Got my wifeys smokin' trees, my bad bitch on that E
But that pussy, money, weed, shit that's all a nigga need

How 'bout me and you, and you and her
Take a ride to make this high
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on
So I say

[A$AP Rocky:]
Niggas pistol-poppin' like it's 1999
I was nine, maybe ten, then again, never mind
Press rewind, back in time
Before rappers droppin' dimes
Trap or die, choppin' pies
With clichÃ©s all in they rhymes
Now it's Gucci, Prada and anything designer
Money, power, the whole enchilada
Commas, dollas, the greens and the guava (oh)

They serve you to your flocka
If you disrespect that blocka, blocka
Choppas on eavesdroppers
Fuck these choppas, I'm about it
Grindin' like 2Pac or Biggie Poppa
Yeah, you outer, but I'm hotter
Car jackin', pistol-packin'
Mothafuckin' choppers clappin'
Metal jacket, automatic magazines, head-on traffic

Fenders smashin', windows crashin'
Pants saggin', fuck your fashion
Yeah, a nigga run Manhattan
Back in Cali's where it happen
They fit Gucci, Escada and anything designer
Groupies, poppers, they all gonna swallow

It was probably the robbers
The goons and the goblins (oh)
They hatin' a lot, medulla oblongata
From New York to San Andreas
And all around the world

Going back to Cali
Going back to Cali
New York to San Andreas
I'm screaming, "Fuck the world!"
I'm going back to Cali
Going back to Cali (Uh)

Fuck killin' these, cuz, I'm on the set, cuz
We killin' everything, anything movin'
Shit, I'm shootin' at niggas on the sight, cuz
You already know, yeah

He ain't copped that, fuck that, Blood
Niggas slippin' on the cuz, cuz
I had to make that happen with this solo

[A$AP Rocky:]
Maserati, like Atari
With no car keys, push to start it
New Bugatti, two Bugattis
Testarossa, blue Ferrari
Lamborghini, system bumpin'
Me no worried; Rastafari

This the hardest, supersonic
Systematic, too retarded
New Versace, new apartment
Bigger closet, newer carpet

Hit departments, cooler garments
Set my goal up, new accomplish
Shootin' targets, you the target
Movin' targets, new accomplice
Killed the game and still regardless
Beat the charges, do the honors

// Rich Nigga Problems //

'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
But when that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
All your friends hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

Got a mink doormat that say, "Nigga, we made it"
Got all white neighbors and most of 'em racist
They put your name and faces when you goin' in places
Then black ain't enough, you just don't wanna be famous
Real talk, real rap, look, I can't deny shit
Couldn't afford shit, but always was attracted to fly shit
Guess that's why I buy, won't invest or capitalize
But expectin' to die rich, just a rich nigga mindset
That's why I'm packin' up my shit, like I'm back at the mom's crib
Like I'm back on my grind, like it's a nine-to-five shift
'Cause nothin' was handed to me, uh, go in and hand it to me
Like I'm Puffy in '96 (Gimme the loot, gimme the loot)
Let's hope that she really for me, most hoes couldn't handle me
I'm postponin' a family, work hard so they know what I stand for
Just have 'em, the GRAMMY, me, damn, have 'em, GRAMMY, me?
Damn, just don't wanna be famous

And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

Uh, look at me, get what you see, envision me
Brazen chains, is he Pusha T or Mr. T?
No hookah smoke, no niggas, please, no liquor, please
A different me, I'm in this bitch and I'm sippin' tea
Uh, but never spill the tea, most of you niggas sick of me
What would she do to get to me? Get off the tip of the dick of me, please
Another victory, be flawless like the skin on me, please
Don't compare him and me, you offendin' me
This ain't a diss and we ain't enemies
They concerned with breakin' hits, I'm more concerned with makin' history
Loudest nigga in the room the weakest
Them quiet dudes just probably need better speakers
This ain't a modest way of livin', I ain't hungry
Just did a demolition to my kitchen, it was ugly
Cash rules everything around me, get the money, funny
How they got twenty-twenty vision but don't see a nigga vision 'til 2020? (Wow)

'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
