// Find Yourself //

All you've gotta do is find yourself
You lose all the time you wasted
Something yeah, oh yeah
Love if you think straight
There's no reason why you shouldn't find yourself

A jealous mind
All it does is corrupt your time (Corrupt your time, blow your mind)
A heart full of hate, oh yeah
Can be a bad mistake
There might come a day
Well, that you fail to see
A better idea in life
[?] better day

All you've got to do is find yourself (Well, well, oh yeah, yeah)
Find yourself (Oh baby, oh yeah)
Find yourself (Oh)
All you've got to do is find yourself

If you find me, you better listen well
You can find [?] situation gettin' better every day
All you've got to do is find yourself
Find yourself

You can sit down and cry your eyes away
Until your tears have all gone
But when you realize
That you didn't want to stay
Get your head on right, you can't go wrong

You've got to find yourself, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
You've got to find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself, yeah
You've got to find yourself
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Yeah, yeah
Find yourself
All you've got to do is find yourself
Find yourself

// All These Things //

The touch of your lips, baby, next to mine
You make me excited, and you make me feel fine
The touch of your hand, your sweet hello
And the fire inside you when you're holding me close
It's your love so warm and tender
God knows the thrill is so divine
It is all these things, yeah, that make you mine

If you would leave, lord, I know, I'm gonna die
Cause when you were ten minutes late mine, you don't know if what you make a grown man cry
And I've got it bad, but that's alright
Just as long as you're near me every night
Cause it's your love, it's so warm and tender
Girl, the thrill, thrill, oh, is so divine
It is all these things, my baby, that make you mine
Say you gonna be mine
I just love you, lord, I love you, lord knows, I love you, yeah
Baby... why... can't you see, I love you...

// Trick Bag //

Twelve o' clock at night
You walked out doors
You told me baby
You were gone to the drug-store

Momma in my mind
I knew you was lying
'Cause the drug-store closed at a quarter to nine
Said I saw you and Willy 'cross the fence
I heard you telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You tryna put me in a trick bag

Walked in my front door
I heard my back door slam
I peeped out my window
Somebody's taking it on the lam
Now we had a fight
Momma you got mad
You jumped on the telephone
Called your mom and dad
They come running down
With big old bats in their hands
Told me don't you hit the girl no more
Don't you understand?

But I saw her kissing Willy y'all
'Cross the fence, tried to tell him
Heard her telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
The way she's been acting is such a drag
She tryna put me in a trick bag

You give me wrong
Momma, I know I'm right
No it wasn't I now
That started the fight
"But she's my daughter
And I'm her pa
And you ain't nothing
But a no-good son-in-law"

But I saw her kissing Willy
'Cross the fence
I heard her telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
Hey the way she's been acting is such a drag
She done put me in a trick bag
