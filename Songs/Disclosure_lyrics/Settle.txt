Album: Settle

// Intro //

How do you stay motivated in the midst of everything that's going on? How do you build your personal momentum and how do you get in the zone? Right? And I'm glad you asked. (Okay)

Three things, you better catch it. My mother used to say, people love watching fire burn! Alright? Okay, that's one thing I know about life, one thing I know about life is a guarentee, right? Change is inevitable! And listen to me, as much as you like to be in your comfort zone, as much as you like to be stable, as much as you like to control your environment, the reality is: everything changes

Alright here's my last one, my last one is make, Carl you gotta give me that term again, it's spontaneous combustion I think is what they call it and what happens is...

// When A Fire Starts To Burn //

When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gonna bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing with their life
[4x]

When a fire starts to

// Latch //

(Never [3x])

You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down (never)
You, you enchant me even when you're not around (never)
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down (never)
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found (never)

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch (never)
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch (never)
How do you do it, you got me losing every breath (never)
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest (never)?

I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you (never)
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never)

Latching on to you (I'm latching on to you)
I won't let go of you (never) (No, I won't let go)
Latching on to you (How you wanna get down)
I won't let go of you
(I won't let go, I won't let go)

// White Noise //

I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes its fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me, onto one
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back
Back, back, back
Back, back

Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

Only you can look at me the way you do
You always tint me tint me black and blue
Such a shame, you frame me with such disdain
You got me washed out, washed out colour drained
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
Lately I've been thinking if you wanna get tough, then let's play rough
I don't need you, giving it straight to me, giving it straight to me
Just gonna get my back
I don't need you, telling me how to be, telling me how to be
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Just gonna get my back
Back, back, back
Back, back, back
Back, back
[Echo]
All I hear is...
[Repeats]
Just noise, white noise
Just noise, white noise
I'm hearing static, you're like an automatic
You just wanna keep me on repeat and hear me crying

(Hear me crying)
(Hear me crying)
(Just noise)
(Just noise)

// Defeated No More //

Defeated no more
I just feel I let you go
Been cheated, I've been fooled
But you're my heart and glow gone

Gotta let this fire keep burning
Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
Cause I won't let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on [2x]

Defeated no more
I still watched you take it all
I'm healed and I'm reborn
But my heart's taking off the cold

Gotta let this fire keep burning
Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
Cause I won't let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on [2x]

I can feel it working from the last you know
I can feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think you're hurting but can you love?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I can feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you thinkâ¦
Can you love? [4x]
Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've faded and I fought
But now I know I make the rules

Gotta let this fire keep burning
Cause I can't seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
Cause I won't let this take control
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
[3x]

I can feel it working from the last you know
I can feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think you're hurting but can you love?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I can feel it working, but can you?
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you thinkâ¦ [x2]
Can you love? [4x]

// Voices //

There are voices in my head
And my heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They've enticed me into what they're all about

Willpower slips away
And I'm weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my fate
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased up from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
To bring out the good girl side of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Throw the sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I knew

My head became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we're not okay
The feeling brings me pleasure all the same
All the same

You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased up from a place that I can't reach
I would love to practice what I preach
You bring out the good girl side of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
Disconnect [x5]

// Second Chance //

Try me
Look, I I I Iâll be
The one that makes you happy

// Grab Her! //

Yea, grab her [7x]
Yea
Yea, grab her [6x]

Grab her, yea [8x]
Grab her [3x]
Yea, grab her [8x]
Yea, grab her [2x]

// You & Me //

I'll be giving up, oh
Home is where the heart is,
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it's tarnished
You told me it's the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don't be giving that out easily
With my deepest dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me

So please don't let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don't let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who and me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be
We're meant to be

Rolling with the punches
So they won't get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted,
But your arrows are soaring through my chest
Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

So please don't let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don't let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It's gonna be you and me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who and me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be

In your big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will
Know you will
I know you will

// January //

Tell me just what I should be expecting
Cause here I am on my own free will
Fortune favors the brave,
So they say

I might as well fix up and play your game
Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I: we fell behind
But found a way to justify

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that

Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?
Show me something you prefer today
Yeah yeah

Or maybe you're grown up and I'm the same
That amnesia gave you freedom
Or maybe you're the kind that tells a lie just to lie
I never have to say goodbye

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that

// Confess To Me //

I can help you run away for good
Overtake what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all, don't question if I would

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you for nothing
I'll fulfill your desires for you [3x]
[2x]

I can take the lo out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Don't get lost in if you only tell me
I will help you slip and turn it round

Only not to worry
No time left for me
Only not to worry
No time left for me
[2x]

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don't resent it
'Cause I can't stop you for nothing
I'll fulfill your desires for you [5x]
[2x]

// Help Me Lose My Mind //

Talk to me and watch me crumble
You will see me come undone
Faithfully I will look over
There I'll find what you've become
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?

Jealousy will be washed over
Carefully we will come through
Could it be easy to start over?
Somehow I will bring you too
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?

Waiting, waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting
I've been waiting waiting waiting

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind, make me wonder
What I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer?
Who've I been waiting for?

// Boiling //

Somethin' is boilin', boilin' in me
Someone is toyin', toyin' with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out

I need it now, eyy
I need it now, eyy

I need it now, eyy
I need it now, eyy

Someone's ignorin', ignorin' defeat,
But the taste of your poison,
your poison is sweet, so sweet

He won't give up, and I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, and I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave

He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough

I need it now, oooh ohhh
I need it now, ohh whoa-oh
I need it now, ohh whoa-oh
I need it now, eyyy

Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are setting
There's no choice I could do
I've become so reckless
All my love's affected
With the remnants of you
You

I need it now, eyyy

Ohh

// What's In Your Head //

(What's in your head)

Wow, what's in your head
Inside your eyes, feel
Wow, what's in your head
You're the silent head
[6x]

Yeah

Wow, what's in your head
You're the silent eyes, feel

// Tenderly //

Just thinking about you
Just thinking about you
Just thinking about you
Just thinking about you

You just give me this feeling

// Running //

Keep me running, you keep me running...

I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you

Whoa, would you hold my hand lightly ever so gently here
Never give up, never give up
Whoa, would you pull me closer and nobody knows we're there
No one can find us

I'm lost again, it's happening
When you're around I just go weak
All I wanna know, is it mutual
Then I never want to leave
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all
Then I'm ready to run, ready to fall
Think I'm ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you
You keep me, keep me running, me running

And I'm lost again, it's keep happening
But when I'm around you,
when I'm around you
I just go weak
And I wanna know, is it mutual
Am I'm ready to run, am I ready to fall?
I think I'm just ready to loose it all

Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running
Keep me running, you keep me running, you
