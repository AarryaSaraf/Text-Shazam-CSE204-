// Boss //

Yeah she's the boss and I'm an old romantic doing favors, don't look good on paper.
But when she looks behind these eyes girl I can see the psychic, and baby I like it.
[repeated]

// Feel Like I Do //

One, two, one, two, three, four

I feel like I do
(Like I do)
I feel like I do
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
All the years, I, I see
(I, I see)
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
Let me know how you feel
Let me know how you feel
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
I feel like I do
(Like I do)
All the years, I, I see
(I, I see)
I feel like I do
(Like I do... do)
(Like I do)
(Like I do)
You got me now
(Like I do)
(Like I do)
