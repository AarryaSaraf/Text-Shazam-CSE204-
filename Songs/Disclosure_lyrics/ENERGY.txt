Album: ENERGY

// Watch Your Step //

I've been workin' and I spent my time
Dreamin' about how I could ease my mind
Breakin' dance, feels like I can fly
Give me some space so I can close my eyes

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights go down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

I'm free tonight, don't want this to end
I'm here alone and you can leave your friends
Breakin' dance and we don't pretend
Chain linked together, now our rhythms bend

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights go down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)

(Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights come down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)

Eye for an eye make the whole world blind
Don't fuck up my high
High as Hell with your YSL
Drip's on, looking like a Mademoiselle
See you pretty in pink, can I tickle you?

// Who Knew? //

Who knew? What you'd do to me
I can't fake it
I can't break this spell I won't let go
Who knew?

Was out there by my own
You help me get to know me
You know me well I owe you
I know I won't hold back
I know I can't hold back, babe
Who knew what you do?
I just can't time waist
I'm in my bag way back when nigga didn't no have sense
You was a Faberge egg then much to delicate
I could not fathom breaking bread then
Now I'm breaking bad habits
Had to face the backtracking
Had to face it and ask
Who knew?
Who knew?

I could grow, like the trees
I could show you, I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand
I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
(And we'll be gone off that in 10
That's when the vibe start setting in)
I could grow, like the trees

Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?
Alright, look, look, look, look, look
Just in case you ain't got it by now
Listen to me, bring it in
If you are alive
I know you ain't reach your best yet
You got more, you could do more
You could see more, you could be more, alright?

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look

Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearing me?

Ah-ha!

Now we gon' take it to another level

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look
Ah!

A lot of you, you're not where you wanna be
You thinking of negative stuff
You talking negativity
You in that negative zone
I need you to do me a favour
I need you to know that
In order for you to get to that next level
The one thing you need to do
To go where you've never gone before
Is to change the way you think

Where your focus goes, your energy flows
Are you hearing me?

Right now
You should feel invincible
Powerful
Strong
Look
Ah!

// Thinking 'Bout You (Interlude) //

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Where do I go) When you're away?
(What do I do?) Think of you
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

Thinkin' of you (Thinkin')
Here by my side
Wanting just to touch your face and hands
(Thinkin' 'bout you, ba-)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

// Birthday //

Oh babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wonderin' what you would say
Or would it be a big mistake?

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

Yeah
I ain't even callin' for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time
To give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out of the way
But it can't hurt to check up on an ex, not to flex
But to put the hurt to rest, put maturity to the test
So I'm callin' to say "Are you okay?" on your special day

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

If I called you on your birthday?
Would it be worth it?
Should I call you on your birthday?

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

But is it working?

// Reverie //

Slipped into a reverie, I can see a better me
Things that's heavenly, like love and melody
Fly high, my wings propellin' me
To the heights of angels that dwell in me
These are the flights that I take with family
They keep me grounded by understandin' me
I stand under the rain, it feels powerful
Same force that make all the flowers bloom
Same force we come from, me and you
The same force that made you so valuable
I say, "Don't let the world take it out of you"
I say, "Don't let the world take it out of you"
We living in times, tryin' to hold on
Sayin', "What's Goin' On?" like the old song
People feeling naked with their clothes on
They wanna go home, I tell em', "Go strong"

A lotta sayers, we need more doers
Stay true to the one that run through us
Hold on when they try to subdue us
Old mind-state, they never really knew us
Innervisions, reminiscing
Mourn our conditions, no pot to piss in
We the children of a mission
When freedom calls, we gotta listen

// Know Your Worth //

He keeps leaving you for dead
I don't know what you've been waiting for
So you've got your love locked up instead
But something better's waiting at your door

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you feeling down
You keep strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

(Find someone who loves you at your worst)

Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

// Talk //

Can't we just talk?

I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', yeah

Started off right, I could see it in your eyes
I could tell that you wantin' more

There's no reason we should hide
Tell me something I ain't heard before
Ooh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on, so stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can't we just talk?

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin', oh now
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock
Ooh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can't we just talk? (Ooh)
Can't we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost
Lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowing
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far

Can't we just talk?
Can't we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

// Birthday (Disclosure VIP Remix) //

Oh, babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wondering what you would say
Would it be a big mistake?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay?
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay?
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

Yeah

I ain't even calling for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you've been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time to give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out the way, but it
Can't hurt to check up on an ex
Not to flex but to put the hurt to rest
Put maturity to test
So I'm calling to say
Are you okay on your special day?

Can I call you on your birthday (Your birthday)
Just to make sure that you're okay? (Okay)
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday (Can I call you?)
Just to make sure that you're okay? (You're okay)
Got the number to your old phone (Oh yeah)
But is it working? (Working, working, oh)

If I called you on your birthday, yeah
Would it be worth it?

Should I call you on your birthday?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Till you deserve it

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay? (You're okay)
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost (Go ghost)
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay? (Make sure that you're okay)
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

But is it working?
