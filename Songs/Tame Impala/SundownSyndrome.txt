// Sundown Syndrome //

Please don't get answers from eyes
You know that mine can't lie quite as well as yours
Just let the spare moment flow
Rounding steps as I go through the open doors
Please don't deflate from a sigh
I'd hold still every time but I'd start to shake 
I wander around for days
Wondering what I'll say when they want the truth

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me

You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
You will never know how hard I try
To keep from waning while waiting at the start
The depth of every touch is real as you need
But words don't do any favours for me
