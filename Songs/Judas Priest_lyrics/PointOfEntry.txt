// Heading Out To The Highway //

Hit'em boys!

Well I've said it before, and I'll say it again
You get nothing for nothing: expect it when
You're backseat driving, and your hands ain't on the wheel
It's easy to go along with the crowd,
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
Oh that's the way to find what you've been missing

So I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!

You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your bidding
Now, wherever you turn, wherever you go
If you get it wrong, at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together!

And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothing to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall!

On the highway! On the highway!

Making a curve or taking the strain
On the decline, or ut on the wain
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights, we'll square up and mend.
Back on your feet to take the next bend!
You weather every storm that's coming atcha!

And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm gonna do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
Yes, I'm heading out to the highway,
I got nothing to lose at all.
I got nothing to lose at all!

// Don't Go //

Come on, come on now what you say
Somebody say you leave today
What's this thing you're doin' to me
What's this fool you're tryin' to be
You're talkin' nothin' but a load of guff
You're tryin' to put somethin' in my lap, lap

Don't go. Please don't leave me
Don't go in the mornin'
Don't go. Please don't deceive me
Don't take it away

I do, I do anything for you
You make my stormy clouds blue
Inside out, I'm upside down
Back to front I'm all around
Don't cha leave me by myself
I don't like it

Don't go. Please don't leave me
Don't go in the mornin'
Don't go. Please don't deceive me
Don't take it away

// Hot Rockin' //

I've done my share of workin' out.
I wanna go some place, where I can scream and shout.
Show me the lights, where I can find
The only thing I need to give me peace of mind!

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'

Where is the spark that kicks the air?
Where is the energy that charges everywhere?
I see the crowd, I hear the roar!
I feel my body to leave the ground and soar!

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'!

I'm goin' out in search of the bright lights.
Somehow I feel that tonight is the right night!
I'm almost there, I've got the vibration.
It's coming strong from this generation.
My blood is hot, from now on I'm set free!
My pulse is hot, so don't try to stop me!
Cuz this is it, and I'm Hot Rockin'!

Don't let it stop, don't let it end,
Please let it carry on and on and on again.
I get so high. Knocked off my feet, yeah!
This is the only way I want, I want, I want

I wanna go, I wanna go, I wanna go Hot Rockin'!

It's all I want, it's all I crave.
I just do want to go Hot Rockin'!

// Turning Circles //

Change, change, it's all rearrangin'
Lookin' around at the situation
Go back, see what you're doin'
The way you're takin' life, you're goin'
To rack and ruin

I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got somethin' wrong to say

Slow down, see where we're headin'
The way things are goin' now
Your life it ain't pleasin'
Had my share of up and down
Don't spend time, don't spend time
Rushin' around.

I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.
Uh-uh... uh-uh...
Uh-uh... uh-uh...
I'm turning circles, so stay away
We've all got somethin' wrong to say.
Uh-uh... uh-uh... (turning circles)...
Uh-uh... uh-uh... (stay away)...

// Desert Plains //

Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I heed your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

// Solar Angels //

Golden halos radiating higher
Diamond visions softly breathing fire
Sky processions we are watching you arrive

Silver crystals arching beams below
What light spirals lifting up to go
Glass formations solar angels spread their wings

Spectral gliders drifting in the air
Wheels of wonder floating everywhere
Draped in rainbows gently we ascend

// You Say Yes //

Say you want to rip it up
Paint the town red
Wanna do the hot spots
Get it in the head
You drive me crazy
I know your game
You done it all before
You'll do it all again

You say yes, I say no

My blood's on fire
I grit my teeth
You're nothin' but a teaser
Gimme some relief
I'm lookin' at the bottle
Sinkin' to the floor
I gotta white knuckles
Can't take it anymore

You say yes, I say no

What do you treat me so
What I do, I do for you

// All The Way //

Alright baby. You know how to have a good time don't cha
It's the way you stand
You're always attracting attention

Now with your hands on your hips, and a
Snarl on your lips
Your eyes wore the look of danger
There's a lion in your heart,

That's set to quick start,

To a glance from any stranger
You give as good as you get
No one's beat you yet
You take the lead
You never need
You know all the moves you've got to make

You take it all, you take it all the way

Ya never do things by half
You're a man with a reputation
You never shy when the problems fly
You can cope with any situation
You take the wheel and crack the whip
You never slip
You rule the roost
You always boast
Yeah you're lookin' after number one

You take it all, you take it all the way

// Troubleshooter //

You've got it, I want it. My little Troubleshooter.
I need it, you feed it. My hunger drives me to ya.
You bring me round with your velvet hands; you're gettin' new life to me.
You put me back to promised land, just where you know I should be.

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down

You're givin' I'm gettin'. I'm gettin' satisfaction.
You're makin' I'm takin'. I want some heavy action.
You're bendin' and I'm mendin', gettin' back together.
You really got what it takes to make a bad man better.

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down.
Right down, right down, right down....

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down.

You've got it, I want it. My little Troubleshooter.
I need it, you feed it. My hunger drives me to ya.
You're bendin' and I'm mendin', gettin' back together.
You really got what it takes to make a bad man better.

You can take me
You can shake me
You can break me down.

// On The Run //

I'm rollin' and ridin' away
Cause I'm a reelin' and feelin' o.k.

Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run

I'm a rockin' and sellin' my soul
Cause I'm livin' for rock and for roll

Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run

I'm shakin' all day and all night
Yeah I'm doin' what I know is right

Forget about tomorrow
Go for it today
Cause I'm on, on the run

// Thunder Road //

Red light, green light
I'm coming home tonight
Burning the freeway
Out of control

Red light, dead lines
We streak from town to town
I's too much, I need your touch
I've been away too long

Out again upon the thunder road
Driving back to you where I belong
I've had enough
Dreams can wait
I'm coming home

Spotlights, wild nights
I know it wrong from right
Places, the faces
All look the same

Hot wired, so tired
Living from song to song
The madness, the badness
It's just a game

Watch the sunrise
From coast to coast
That's when I need your loving
Oh! That's when I need it most
Can't explain, it's something in the blood
Wouldn't change it even if I could

// Desert Plains (Live) //

Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I need your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
