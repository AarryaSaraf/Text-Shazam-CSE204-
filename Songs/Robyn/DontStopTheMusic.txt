// Don't Stop The Music //

This little girl didn't care what anybody said

She got the whole world dancing to the music in her head

They loved to trash her bad, laugh at her and call her names, aah yea

And now they all try to copy her, isn't that a shame

It always made her stronger

[Chorus:]

Don't stop the music 

The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and 

Don't stop the music 

People keep dancing

You can do it

Baby come on

Baby come on


He knew that he was different

This sucker couldn't win

They didn't dig his vision

They tried to fit him in

But there's no room for loosers

Until they make you change 

And then you laugh at them

Tell me how much longer...

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]

You've got a perfect body, you've got a perfect smile

You're unlike anybody, got your own shine come on

If you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no pain

Baby it's your decision, only you can break the chain


So all you gotta do is dance, come on


Music like love floating in the air

You can reach out grab it everywhere

Showing you you're special loved

You were put here on earth to make goodness for people

Better make it worth living while the world still spinning, come on!


Don't stop, stop the music

The world will keep turning if you use it, Baby come on

Don't stop, stop the music

Keep on dancing, you can do it

Baby come on

Baby come on

Baby come on


Don't stop, stop the music

Keep on dancing, you can do it

Baby come on

// O Baby //

[Chorus:]

O baby you're making that mistake again oh why

O don't you understand, everytime you do you make me cry


I see those tears and it hurts so much each time you say you're sorry

cause no more words or regretful touch could change the way I'm feeling

You're doing me wrong again and again you say that you will but you won't

[Chorus]


I stayed up late every lonely night waiting for you to call me

I used to think if I gave you time ooo baby you'd find a way to make it right

You're doing me wrong again and again you say that you will but you won't 

[Chorus]


Don't explain and don't ask me why oh baby please stop crying

We've been through this one too many times so baby don't you put me there again

Cause no matter how hard I try to believe this tiem I know that I won't 

[Chorus]


Don't wonder why, baby don't cry, let's say goodbye

// Blow My Mind //

Straight up from my heart you're my number one

And hey here's the part I'm still having fun

It's like you're the cloud underneath my feat

And you're the reason that breathe


Because you blow my mind

Because you blow my mind

And the way you're talking baby you're so cool

I'll do anything for you...


Hey baby ravish me, love me till it hurts

Don't you dare to leave , button down my skirt

Kiss me quick I'm about to burst , patience ain't my thing

And you're the reason that I sing


Because you blow my mind

Because you blow my mind

And the way you're talking baby you're so cool

I'll do anything for you...


Unbelievable, ooo it's such a rush

So incredible, boy you make me blush

Just keep doing it , throw me into space 

And I'll be floating there for days


Because you blow my mind

Because you blow my mind

And the way you're talking baby you're so cool

I'll do anything for you...

// Moonlight //

Oh baby no, don't you go, let them wait

Oh baby no, don't you go, baby stay...

[Verse 1:]

Don't know the time but I feel you're getting out of bed

The way you felt last night I wanna feel it again


Oh baby no, don't you go, let them wait

Baby don't leave me alone, please stay

[Chorus:]

Through the moonlight, sunshine

We can go on and on, I'll be holding you close

Through the moonlight, sunshine

Here in a world of our own

Baby don't go

[Verse 2:]

You say you've got things to do gotta get on with your day

I say but think of the things we could do if you stayed


No I don't wanna be on my own

Baby don't leave your baby alone

// Breakdown Intermission //

Hey my friend I thought you knew it's all an illusion

And nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view?

It goes on and on and on and on and on. BREAK OUT!

[Chorus:]

If you wanna dance better take your chance (suckers)

Don't be scared cause I'ma show you how

We can learn to boogie

I'ma break it down turn this world around (suckers)

If you wanna follow DO IT NOW

Gotta learn to boogie DO IT NOW


All the things they're selling you makes you think you need them

Pretty pretty girls with witty witty words

I don't know what you think you heard (suckers)

and nobody knows what to do, what's your point of view

It goes on and on and on and on and on. BREAK OUT!

[Chorus]

// Ain't No Thing //

[Verse 1:]

Boy you gotta want me, really really want me

Boy you gotta need me cause baby I can't get enough and I

I'm trying to catch the feeling of how we used to be and 

How it used to feel back then

[Chorus:]

I'm saying that it ain't no thing for me 

Baby if it ain't no thing for you 

But baby if is a thing for you

There'll be nothing for me and nothing for you


Said you might wanna write this down

[Verse 2:]

Boy you know i want you, really really want you, oh really need you

But I don't wanna pick up your socks

And maybe it's a really silly thing but baby

It would just be nice to compromise

// Big City //

Lately shit's been driving me crazy

Won't you take me outta this city

Streets too busy

Men too old and the girls too pretty


I see that you want me

I'm needing somebody

Don't ask me no questions

There's really no reason

You look like your ready

To run from the city

I'm feelin the same way

Just wanna get away


Met you on the corner of my favorite shop

I don't really care if I know you or not

All I really need, someone to hold me tonight

Doesn't make a difference if its wrong or its right

Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you

And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you

But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got

See I don't really care if we make it or not


Lately shit's been driving me crazy

Won't you take me outta this city

Streets too busy

Men too old and the girls too pretty

Baby won't you come and save me

Won't you make my world less chilly

Don't need pitty

Just your arms around my body


Won't you come and take me

Away from the city

Let's do it today

Just want to get away


Met you on the corner of my favorite shop

I don't really care if I know you or not

All I really need, someone to hold me tonight

Doesn't make a difference if its wrong or its right

Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you

And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you

But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got

See I don't really care if we make it or not


Lately shit's been driving me crazy

Won't you take me outta this city

Streets too busy

Men too old and the girls too pretty

Baby won't you come and save me

Won't you make my world less chilly

Don't need pitty

Just your arms around my body [X2]


Can you do that for me....

// Psycho //

Psycho


Just woke up

but it's not a dream

you're still and I'm freaking

don't wanna know 'bout your plans

don't know how this shit began


Psycho


You say you love me

I bite my lip

But inside I am screaming

This is it I'm about to flip

You're staying But I wish you were leaving


You're P-S-Y-C-H-O

I thought that you ought to know

why can't you just let me be

You're turning psycho on me

You better rethink your life

I'll never be your wife

I feel just like deadly

You're turning psycho on me


Whoa baby

no baby

don't wanna know baby

leave baby

You're turining psycho on me


You call my house 

you ask my friends

you wanna know how I'm doing

Real cute stuff but I call the bluff

You bitter you don't think I know it

So wipe the tears out of your eyes

The guilt trip thing isn't working

get your tounge out of my mouth

It's more then just a little disturbing


You're P-S-Y-C-H-O

I thought that you ought to know

why can't you just let me be

You're turning psycho on me

You better rethink your life

I'll never be your wife

I feel just like deadly

You're turning psycho on me


Whoa baby

no baby

don't wanna know baby

leave baby

me baby

You're turining psycho on me


psycho

psycho

You're P-S-Y-C-H-O

I thought that you ought to know

why can't you just let me be

You're turning psycho on me

You better rethink your life

I'll never be your wife

I feel just like deadly

You're turning psycho on me


Whoa baby

no baby

don't wanna know baby

leave baby

You're turining psycho on me


you better rethink your life

Don't come back here no more

knocking on my door

I don't want you around

Just leave me alone


Whoa baby

You're turining psycho on me

// Still Your Girl //

Did you think I'd leave you down

I know you didn't think that I was gonna change I know, I know

It's still the way you make it sound

Like I was gonna put somebody in your place I won't, I won't


Cause you and me in misery can never mix and never meet

The way it is, just like a kiss between our lips there's only bliss

And even though I let you know when things are bad just let it go

It's not the end I'm still your friend, I'm still your friend, I'm still

your friend


If you're looking for somebody to take away your heartache

let me be the one you've got when you need to free your heart

and no matter what they say I will guide you on your way

Yeah baby I just wanna make it alright, make it alright


I don't wanna steal your crown

I just wanna let you know that i'm around when things come crashing down

And even when it's pain you feel

I just wanna keep it real, don't you know, don't you know


Cause you and me were meant to be eternally, trough anything

And anytime and any place, an empty room, you fill the space

And when at times you feel like crying just let it go, it's not a crime

It's still our world, I'm still your girl, I'm still your girl, I'm still

your girl


If you're looking for somebody to take away your heartache

let me be the one you've got when you need to free your heart

and no matter what they say I will guide you on your way

Yeah baby I just wanna make it alright, make it alright


I can see it in your eyes, someone took away your shine

Though your heart's in a prison you still got it inside

So when you build a wall around, I'm just gonna break it down

Though I can hurt you at times don't deserve you

It's still our world and I'm still your girl
