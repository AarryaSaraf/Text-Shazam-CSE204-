// Autumn Leaves //

The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow longer
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

Since you went away the days grow longer
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

// Blue Moon //

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "Please, adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "Please, adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

// Candy //

"Candy"
I call my sugar "Candy"
Because I'm sweet on "Candy"
And "Candy" is sweet on me

She understands me
My understanding "Candy"
And "Candy"'s always handy
When I need sympathy

I wish that there were four of her
So I could love much more of her
She has taken my complete heart
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

"Candy"
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my "Candy"
And make him mine all mine

I wish that there were four of her
So I could love much more of her
She has taken my complete heart
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

"Candy"
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my "Candy"
And make him mine all mine

// Chetty's Lullaby //

VeglierÃ² questa notte sol per te
Dolce bimbo ti dirÃ² che presto tornerÃ²
Senza te sento gelo nel mio cuor
Cerco solo l'illusione di averti qui con me

Torneran per me le stelle
Nel mio cielo senza piÃ¹ nubi
Sogni d'or
Scendon lievi verso te
Dormi caro che domani
Col sol ti bacerÃ²

Torneran per me le stelle
Nel mio cielo senza piÃ¹ nubi
Sogni d'or
Scendon lievi verso te
Dormi caro che domani
Col sol ti bacerÃ²

// For All We Know //

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know

// I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You //

I need your love so badly
I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

I thought at last I'd found you
But other lovers surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true

But what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming
Cause I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you

// I'm Thru With Love //

I'm thru with love
I'll never fall again
Said I do to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
That's why I'm thru with love

I've locked my heart
I keep my feelings there
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire
For I need to care for no one
That's why I'm thru with love

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared
You didn't need me
You have your share
Of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion
Emotion

Did you good by the spring
And all it meant to me
A good neighbor
The things that used to be
For I must have you or no one
That's why I'm thru with love
That's why I'm thru with love

// I've Got You Under My Skin //

I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I'd tried so not to give in
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin
And I like you under my skin

// Il Mio Domani //

Cerco te, soffro tanto senza te
Chiamo te, se non vieni morirÃ²
La primavera che per me non tornerÃ  mai piÃ¹

Ma perchÃ© il destino separÃ²
Te da me non lo so ma ti vorrÃ²
Felice sempre qui con me per non lasciarti piÃ¹

Quando nel ricordo del tuo viso
Sogno sospirando il paradiso
Scordo la tristezza della vita
Dolcemente cara tamero forse

L'alba giÃ  vedo sorgere per me
PorterÃ  la speranza nel mio cuore che
Sempre vorrei te vicino per non piÃ¹ soffrir

// Imagination //

Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
Makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
"What to do, what to do?"

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine you want me, too

Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again?
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine you want me, too

// Line For Lyons //

Listen to them play our song
How they shock my poor brain
With that electric refrain
I hear a buzzin', just like a dozen doorbells

Every time I hear our song
I get weak in the knees, my heart pumps up a breeze
Sending a stream to every extremity

Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly

Even on a violin
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song

Parts of my anatomy are not controlled by me
The music's magic spell
Leaves me a mess of quivering jelly

Even on a violin
How those sweet dulcet tones pull marrow out of my bones
I must confess, it leaves me a mess, our song does
I love to hear our song 'cause
It grooves me so, our song

// Moonlight Becomes You //

Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

// Motivo Su Raggio Di Luna //

Un eco dolcemente dentro me
Ripete delle note che non so
Risuona questa musica nel cuor'
Eppure mai nessuno la cantor'

CercherÃ² quel motivo
Perche non dormerÃ²
Fin quando saprÃ²
Raggio di luna

Che me porto
Quel canto che la notte
Fa sognar'

Meravigliose labbra
Che non ho
Meravigliose labbra
Che non ho

// My Foolish Heart //

The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart

// My One And Only Love //

The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips, so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

// Spring Is Here //

Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me

Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

// Walkin' //

Love is quite the joker
He likes to have his fun
Set you down in clover
'Til he wins you over

Then suddenly leaves you flat
Just like that
Here's your hat
Start walkin'

It isn't easy
The way love plays his game
You can think you're winning
'Til the final inning

But if there's a change of heart
On his part
Might as well
Start walkin'

When things are moving
Then love's a happy child
But if nothing's doing
You got troubles brewing

As soon as his interest lacks
Hit some snags
Pack your bags
Start walkin'

Cause love's a joker
Who likes to have his fun
Set you down in clover
'Til he wins you over

Then suddenly leaves you flat
Just like that
Here's your hat
Start walkin'

// Whatever Possessed Me //

Whatever possessed me
Came from the blue
Drew me closer to you
And with an electrifying
Sweet surprise
I really knew
That loving you
Possessed me

Down to my toes
Blessed me
And heaven knows
Whatever possessed me
In its magic skim
My life's a wondress dream

Explain to me
How every noon
Some morning moon's
Stands by
And why those clouds
Of almond blossoms
Swirl each midnight sky

Whatever possessed me
Goes all the way
Love me
And need I say
Whatever possessed me darling
Darling don't ignore
While you possessed me more

Whatever possessed me
Goes all the way
Love me
And need I say
Whatever possessed me darling
Darling don't ignore
While you possessed me more

// You Go To My Head //

You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head
