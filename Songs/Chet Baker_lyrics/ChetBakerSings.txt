// That Old Feeling //

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

Once again, I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart

// It's Always You //

Whenever it's early twilight
I watch till the star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

Wherever you are you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

// Like Someone In Love //

Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
Feeling like someone in love
In love

// My Ideal //

Long ago my heart and mind
Got together and designed
The wonderful girl for me
Oh, what a fantasy

Though the ideal of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy

Will I ever find the girl in my mind?
The one who is my ideal
Maybe she's a dream
And yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass her by
And never even know
That she was my ideal?

Will I recognize the light in her eyes
That no other eyes reveal?
Or will I pass her by
And never even know?
That she is my ideal

// I've Never Been In Love Before //

I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you for evermore

I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score

But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour

So, please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour
So, please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

// My Buddy //

Nights are long since you went away
I think about you all through the day
My buddy, my buddy, nobody quite so true

Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

Miss your voice, the touch of your hand
Just long to know that you understand
My buddy, my buddy, your buddy misses you

// But Not For Me //

They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

// Time After Time //

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time
You'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

// I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes) //

I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you, just like I should

What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon
What's in store
Should I fall once more?
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except perhaps in spring
But I should never think of spring
For that would surely break my heart in two...

// There Will Never Be Another You //

There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever, be another you?

Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never, ever, be another you?

// I Fall In Love Too Easily //

I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love so easily
I fall in love too fast

My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
But still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
