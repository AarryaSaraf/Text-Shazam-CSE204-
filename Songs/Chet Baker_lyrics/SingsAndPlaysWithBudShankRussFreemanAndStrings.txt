// Let's Get Lost //

Let's get lost
Lost in each other's arms
Let's get lost
Let them send out alarms
And though they'll think us rather rude
Let's tell the world
We're in that crazy mood

Let's defrost
In a romantic mist
Let's get crossed
Off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Mmm, let's get lost

Let's defrost
In a romantic mist
Let's get crossed
Off everybody's list
To celebrate this night we found each other
Mmm, let's get lost

// Long Ago & Far Away //

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Long ago and far away
I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed
You're here at last

Chills run up and down my spine
Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago
Was you

// Just Friends //

Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends but not like before

To think of what we've been
And not to kiss again
Seems like pretending
It isn't the ending

Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart

We loved, we laughed, we cried
Suddenly love died
The story ended
But we're just friends

Two friends drifting apart
Two friends but one broken heart

We loved, we laughed, we cried
Suddenly love died
The story ended
But we're just friends

// I Wish I Knew //

I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer

If you don't care, why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so
Should I keep dreaming on or just forget you?
What shall I do? I wish I knew

If you don't care, why let me hope and pray so?
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so
Should I keep dreaming on or just forget you?
What shall I do? I wish I knew (Yes, I do)
What shall I do? I wish I knew

// Daybreak //

Daybreak, another new day
The mist on the meadow is drifting away
'Cause it's daybreak, the sun's in the sky now
And flowers break through their blanket of dew

Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on to the blue
At daybreak, I daydream of you

Sunrise, how lovely it seems
To see from my window a sky full of dreams
As the white clouds sail on to the blue
At daybreak, I daydream of you

// You Don't Know What Love Is //

You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

// Grey December //

Shadows pass my window
Dark and lonely forms
Memories of a fire become an ember
Grey December

Listen, can't you hear it?
Silent and listless tread
Shapless dreams I try hard to remember
Grey December

Couldn't you play the role lovers do?
And stay just for this moment
But love wasn't meant for sorrow and lament
So I'll do my dreaming alone

Softly now, I see them
Lovers' arms entwined
Shadows of a love I can't remember
Now or never
Grey December

Softly now, I see them
Lovers' arms entwined
Shadows of a love I can't remember
Now or never
Grey December

// I Remember You //

Was it in Tahiti?
Were we on the Nile?
Long, long ago, singing our song
I recall that I saw your smile

I remember you
You're the one
Who made my dreams
Come true
A few kisses ago

I remember you
You're the one
Who said
I love you too
Didn't you know?

I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all

Then I shall tell them
I remember you

I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain
Out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me
To recall
The thrill of them all

Then I shall tell them
I remember you

If they should ask
I'll gladly tell them
I remember you
