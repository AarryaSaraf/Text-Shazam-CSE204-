// Trav'lin' Light //

I'm travilin light
Because my girl has gone
And from now on
I'm travilin' light

She said "Goodbye"
And took my heart away
So from now on
I'm travilin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories

Some lucky night
She may come back again
But until then
I'm travilin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories

Some lucky night
She may come back again
But until then
I'm travilin' light

// Easy Living //

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

I never regret the years that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand
They just don't understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

// There Is No Greater Love //

There is no greater love than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone...

There is no greater love in all the world
It's true
No greater love than what I feel for you
