// How Deep Is The Ocean? //

How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

// If You Could See Me Now //

If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you

If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you

You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now

// Oh, You Crazy Moon //

When they met, the way they smiled, I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon, what did you do?
And when they kissed
They tried to say that it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon, look what you've done

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

There they are, they fell in love
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart

Once you promised me, you know, that it would never end
You should be ashamed to show your funny face, my friend

And there they are, they fell in love
I guess you think that you're smart
Oh, you crazy moon, you broke my heart
