// Born To Be Blue //

Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few
And clovers being green
Is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue

When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view
But moonbeams being gold
Are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But there's nothing that strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, well

I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue

When I met you
The world was bright and sunny
When you left the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh
But nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel, well

I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more
Than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue

// Everything Depends On You //

I could sing a new song
Never sing a blue song
Everything depends on you

I could end my dreaming
Lonely nights of scheming
Everything depends on you

Mountains may be high
Oceans may be wide
But I'll reach the sky with you by my side

I could end my story
In a blaze of Glory
Everything depends on you

Mountains may be high
Oceans may be wide
But I'll reach the sky with you by my side

I could end my story
In a blaze of glory
Everything depends on you
Everything depends baby
Depends on you

// The Touch Of Your Lips //

The touch of your lips
Upon my brow
Your lips that are cool
And sweet
Such tenderness lies
In their soft caress
My heart forgets to beat

The touch of your hands
Upon my head
The love in your eyes ashine
And now, at last
That moment divine...

The touch of your lips
On mine...

The touch of your hands
Upon my brow
The love in your eyes ashine
And now, at last
That moment divine...

The touch of your lips
The love in your eyes
The touch of your lips
On mine...

// You're Mine, You! //

You're mine, you
You belong to me, you
I will never free you
You're here with me to stay

You're mine, you
You are mine completely
Love me strong or sweetly
I need you night and day

Arm in arm, hand in hand
We will be found together
Heart to heart, lips to lips
We're chained and bound together

I own you
I don't need to buy love
You're a slave to my love
In every way, you're mine

Arm in arm, hand in hand
We will be found together
Heart to heart, lips to lips
We're chained and bound together

I own you
I don't need to buy love
You're a slave to my love
In every way, you're mine

// Sweet Sue, Just You //

Every star above, baby
Knows the one I love:
Sweet Sue - just you!

And the moon on high, baby
Knows the reason why:
Sweet Sue - is you!

No one else it seems
Ever shared my dreams
Without you I don't know what I'd do

In this heart of mine
You live all the time
Ooh, Sue - just you!

// A Taste Of Honey //

Winds may blow over the icy sea
I'll take with me the warmth of thee
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine

I will return
I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

I'll leave behind my heart to wear
And may it e'er remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine

I will return
I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

He ne'er came back to his love so fair
And so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss of honey
A taste more bitter than wine

I will return
I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
I'll come back for the honey and you
