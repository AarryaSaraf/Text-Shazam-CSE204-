// While My Lady Sleeps //

The moon will rise
But all in vain
For there's no use in shining
While my lady sleeps
The breeze will sing
A sadain
Because of heart is pining
While my lady sleeps

Starlight and moonlight
And every melody wasted
What can they mean
When I'm yearning for kisses never tasted

The night may hold a million dreams
But when her eyes discovered
Just a lonely lover
She will hurry on
With a sight to the dawn
While the world weeps
And my lady sleeps

Starlight and moonlight
And every melody wasted
What can they mean
When I'm yearning for kisses never tasted

The night may hold a million dreams
But when her eyes discovered
Just a lonely lover
She will hurry on
With a sight to the dawn
While the world weeps
And my lady sleeps

// Do It The Hard Way //

Do it the hard way
And it's easy sailing
Do it the hard way
And it's hard to lose
Only the soft way
Has a chance of failing
You have to choose

I tried the hard way
When I tried to get you
You took the soft way
When you said "We'll see"
Darling, now I'll let you
Do it the hard way
Now that you want me

I tried the hard way
When I tried to get you
You took the soft way
When you said "We'll see"
Darling, now I'll let you
Do it the hard way
Now that you want me

// I'm Old Fashioned //

I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon my window pane
The starry song that April sings

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs
Holding hands
These, my heart understands

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs
Holding hands
These, my heart understands

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned
With me

// You're Driving Me Crazy //

You, you're driving me crazy
What did I do? What did I do?
My tears for you make everything hazy
Clouding the skies of blue

How true were the friends who were near me?
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you

Yes, you, you're driving me crazy
What did I do to you?

How true were the friends who were near me?
To cheer me, believe me, they knew
But you, were the kind who would hurt me
Desert me when I needed you

Yes, you, you're driving me crazy
What did I do to you?

// It Could Happen To You //

Hide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble
Someone drops a sigh
And down you tumble

Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to me

I'll keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to me

// My Heart Stood Still //

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

// The More I See You //

Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

// Everything Happens To Me //

I make a date for golf, and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party, and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life, just catching colds and missing trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing, I've had the measles and the mumps
And when I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool, who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me

At first, my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this heart that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned and sent an airmail special too
Your answer was goodbye and there was even postage due
I fell in love just once, and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

I've telegraphed and phoned and I sent an airmail special too
Your answer was goodbye and there was even postage due
I fell in love just once, and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me

// Dancing On The Ceiling //

She dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above

I whisper, go away, my lover
It's not fair
But I'm so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

I whisper, go away, my lover
It's not fair
But I'm so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

// How Long Has This Been Going On? //

As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's

So my dear I swore
"Never, never more!"
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Listen, you, tell me true:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then again
What a dunce I was before
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep
That divine rendezvous
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?

// Old Devil Moon //

I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love

// You Make Me Feel So Young //

You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Runnin' across the meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young
