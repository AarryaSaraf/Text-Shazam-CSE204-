Album: EmbraceableYou

// The Night We Called It A Day //

There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day

I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer was he than I

The moon went down stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

// Embraceable You //

Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me

I love all, the many charms about you
Above all, I want my arms about you

Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa, do
My sweet embraceable you

// They All Laughed //

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?"

// There's A Lull In My Life //

Oh, there's a lull in my life
It's just a void and empty space
When you are not in my embrace

Oh, there's a lull in my life
The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day

The clock stops ticking
The world stops turning
Everything stops, but that flame in my heart
That keeps burning
Burning

Oh, oh, oh
There's a lull in my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end

The ache in my heart
The call of my arms
The lull in my life

// Come Rain Or Come Shine //

I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

// Little Girl Blue //

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue

When I were very young, the world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
