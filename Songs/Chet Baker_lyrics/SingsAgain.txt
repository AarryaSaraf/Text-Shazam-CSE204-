// Someone To Watch Over Me //

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know that I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To her heart I'll carry the key

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

// My Funny Valentine //

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart

Your looks are laughable
Un-photographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay little valentine
Stay
Each day is Valentine's day

// Look For The Silver Lining //

Look for the silver lining
Whenever a cloud appears
In the blue
Remember somewhere
The sun is shining
And so the right thing, to do
Is make it shine for you

A heart full
Of joy and gladness
Will always banish
Sadness and strife
So always look for
The silver lining
And try to find
The sunny side of life

A heart full
Of joy and gladness
Will always banish
Sadness and strife
So always look for
The silver lining
And try to find
The sunny side of life

// All Of You //

I love the look of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you, for I love all of you

// Body And Soul //

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
