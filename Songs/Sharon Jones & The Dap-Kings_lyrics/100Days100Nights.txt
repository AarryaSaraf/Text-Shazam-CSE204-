Album: 100Days100Nights

// 100 Days, 100 Nights //

100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
And a little more
Before he knows his own

You know a man
Can play the part
Of a saint
Just so long
For a day comes
When his true, his true self unfolds

He maybe mellow
He maybe kind
Treat you good
All the time

But there's something just beyond what he's told

100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
And a little more
Before he knows his own

Wait a minute
Maybe I need to slow it down just a little
Take my time

I had a man
Tell me things
Made me feel
Just like a queen
And I thought
He was the one
I would hold
Oh yes I did
But one day
I looked around
That old man
Was nowhere to be found
100 days for this heart to unfold

100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
100 days, 100 nights
To know a man's heart
And a little more
Before he knows his own

// Nobody's Baby //

I done left you here
All you by yourself
But it ain't my fault, baby
You treated me like a fool
It ain't my fault, baby
That you treated me so cruel
But you know what?

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one

It's a matter of fact
I expect I can't tell you that
I said, if what you need is a good little soldier
Well, I guess you better look again
Well you know, I ain't nobody's solider, oh lord no
I'm a bona fide cap-I-tan!
Cause I...

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one
You better get yourself a new one

Get it, get it, get it, get it...

// Tell Me //

Woo!

I been away too long
I've come from searchin' Hell for you
But while I've been away, each and every day
My heart was really next to you

Oh yeah

Now I'm here at last
And I mean to stay
Look into my eyes, then you'll realize
There is only one thing left to say

Whoa...

Tell me (tell me you love me)
Be right there (tell me you care)
Tell me, tell me, tell me baby (tell me you love me)
Come on, come on (tell me you care)
Oooh (tell me you love me)
I really love ya! (tell me you care)
You know I need ya! (tell me you love me)
Come on, baby now (tell me you care)

I'm not asking for much, yeah
Dreamin' and wishin' you know
If you some sweet feelin', I'm ready and willing
To take you where you wanna go

Tell me (tell me you love me)
Come on, come on baby (tell me you care)
Let me hear you, let me hear you now (tell me you love me)
Ooh yeah, yeah oh! (tell me you care)
How sweet do you want it? (tell me you love me)
Come on, baby! (tell me you care)

// Be Easy //

Some people say
You've got to fight for a love that's true
Climb every mountain
See every trial and tribulation through
I'm here to tell you
That's only half the lesson
Now if you want a girl to come to you
You've got to leave a little room for guessin'

Oh, just be easy baby
That girl will come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
She'll be easy, too

Don't you know it's just a fool who plays the part
Running a girl down like she's a game in a school yard?
Now if she waits, you should turn and let her alone
And she'll come to you just as sure as you're born

Be easy, baby
That girl will come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
She'll be easy, too

Don't you know
A woman don't want a man down on his knees
Running her down like a mouse at the cheese?
You've got to be mettle if you want her affection
Get too excited, and she's off in another direction

So be easy, baby
That girl will come running to you
If you just be easy, baby
She'll be easy, too

// When The Other Foot Drops, Uncle //

All the way you lie to get your tales, uncle
All the things you lay to waste
But every dog has his day, uncle
And it just can't go on, it just can't go on this way
For the day will surely come
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna pay for all you've done
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
There won't be no way to run
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna be found out of room, yeah
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You can bet you're gonna lose your cloud
You've been trapped in around this world
Like you're the only one livin'
But soon enough you're gonna get back
Some of what you've been givin'
The lies that you've been spinnin' up
Are runnin' out of thread
And your crafty little pencil
Is runnin' out of lead
The happy day is surely gonna come, yeah
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Yeah, your alibis will fail you
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Ain't nobody, nobody gonna make your bed
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
Ain't got no place to hide
(When the other foot drops, uncle)
You're gonna pay for every time you lied
Yes, you oughta be ashamed
For all you've said and done
But before the cop's around the table
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
Get yourself together
(You better pack up and run)
Oh, and pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
You better pack up and run
(You better pack up and run)
Get yourself together
(You better pack up and run)
Run on, run on, run on
You better pack up and run

// Let Them Knock //

Let them knock upon my door
Until they hit them black and blue
I'm not answering for no one
Until my man and I are through

When we're makin' love
You know the world ain't got nothing, oh nothin' to do
Cause when we're makin' love
I don't answer to nobody but you

No, nobody but you babe
Not gonna answer to nobody, no, no

They can call me on the phone
But no matter how times that phone rings, baby
I'm not pickin' up for no one
Until the fat lady sings

When we're makin' love
Now you know the world ain't got nothing, oh! nothing on you
When we're making love
I won't answer to nobody but you

Oh, no

Listen now
People, they ask a lot of me
Alway want more than they got of me yeah
Let them say I'm hard to find
I know what I've got to do
And bring it all home to you
It's your love I got on my mind

Let them wait, let them wonder
Where I go and what I do - yeah yeah
I'm not answering to no one
Until you and I are through

When we're makin' love
You know the world ain't got nothin, oh ain't got nothin' to do
When we're makin' love
I won't answer to nobody but you

Nobody but but you

Nobody but you
I ain't gonna answer to nobody but you baby
Oh no matter how many time the phone rings or who's knockin' at the door
I'm not gonna answer, no, no, no, no, no
I ain't gonna answer no, no, no
Ain't gonna pick up the phone, don't even try
No, no, nobody, nobody, nobody
But you...

// Something's Changed //

Something's changed in you eyes
I could see it when I walked through that door
Something's changed in your eyes
I can tell you and me ain't right no more

You curl your lip into a smile
Even though you've known awhile
You ain't that glad I'm here

Now can't you see I'm getting wise
To what you're hiding from your eyes
Our situation is clear to me

Something's changed in your eyes
I could see it when I walked through that door
Something's changed in your eyes
I can tell you that you and me ain't right no more

The way they won't regard me, those two eyes of yours can only
Do me no kind of wrong
Well once again your eyes are red, in my heart I'll feel no pain
No, all of that is gone

Something's changed in your eyes
I could see it when I walked through that door
Something's changed in your eyes
See... I can tell that you and me ain't right no more

Whoa you don't look at me the way you used to look at me, no
You don't kiss me and hold me the way you used to, no
Something's changed, you don't even talk to me the way you used to talk to me, whoa
You changed, I changed, we changed

Something's changed

// Humble Me //

Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am

When I start talkin' down
Like I'm hovering above, oh yeah
Like I'm made of something better
Oh, than what you're made of
And when you hear me asking
For all kinds of fancy things
Things you've never had, no
And things you know you can't bring

Don't be afraid to...

Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am

When I start demanding more than the rest, oh yeah
And when I start moaning that I didn't get the best
Just remind me of the man
Oooh with nothing to eat
And remind me of the other man
With no shoes on his feet

Who let me be wasteful?
From all that I've seen and all that I have
And everywhere I've been

Make me grateful for my voice
That I might lift you up
And my legs, oh these old legs, yeah
I might jump and run to you
Make me thankful for the music
That puts my soul on high
And grateful for you people
Who comes out to hear me every night

Whoa, please...

Humble me, humble, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am
Humble me, humble me
Don't let me forget who I am

// Keep On Looking //

Once I had a good man
Once a good man, he had me
A happy do right good man
Made me sing sweet melodies
Happiness was around me
You know I had to mine twice
No sorrow will surround me
Once a good man you know he did me right

Treated me good, made me happy
But then one day he left me
There's something I must confess
When he left, I was in a mess

Ooh, let me testify, let me rectify
And explain how he did me wrong

Ooh, he left me all alone
Whoa one day that good man was gone
Whoa he left me all alone

Is there such a thing as true love
Between a woman and a man?
I guess I got to keep on searchin', yeah
Ima keep on searchin' till I find that man again

I got to keep on lookin

I'm gonna look high
I'm gonna look low
Everywhere I go, got to keep on lookin'
Hey, for my true love, yeah

Let me find that true love again
Break it down, break it down

Gonna keep on lookin'... for that true love again
