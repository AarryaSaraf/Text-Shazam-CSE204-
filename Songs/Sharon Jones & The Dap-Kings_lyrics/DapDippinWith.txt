// Got A Thing On My Mind //

I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it

Don't let nobody tell me
My thing it won't come true
Cause I ain't lying down 'til I get my dues

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

Now good things don't come easy
The lord knows that I'm trying
Cause I got what I got
Cause better folks have died

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

Some folks talking
About a war on crime
I'm talking about a city y'all
Where brothers don't have to steal to make a dime

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

// The Dap Dip //

Hey, Band
What, Mickey
Did you hear about the new epidemic going around
Every man, woman, and child is catching it
It's spreading from town to town
It's called the dap dip
And they say you get it in your pants

Oh hell, Mickey
That ain't no epidemic
That's a brand new dance

Don't be too shy
Baby push it to the know how
Everybody gather round
And let me show how

It ain't no thing
But a drop of the hip
Just put some soul in it
You're doing the dap dip
Dap it, ya'll

Walk around
All proud and tall ya'll
Like you ain't got no care
In the world at all, ya'll

Once you got that feeling
You just can't snip it
Just come on with it
Funky town

Just let yourself go
On this funky, funky trip

Up in New York City

// Make It Good To Me //

Don't want to know
Where you been all tonight
Ain't no words you can tell me, baby
To make me feel alright

But if you hold me
In your arms
We can forget all our worries
And all our harms

If you make it good to me baby
The way it used to be

(Can it ever be thesame?)
I don't know, I don't know
But it is tonight
(Won't your friends say it's a shame)
Let em talk, I don't care if it's right
You see the hour's getting late
So take some direction
You see it's half past making up time
And a quarter to affection

But if you ain't got no new thing to say
You better go on and fix it the old fashioned way
And make it good to me baby
The way it used to be

Don't want to hear
Bout your intentions, yeah
You see I heard them all before, darlin
Too many times to mention, yea

If those two lips are gona assist me
You better come on boy
Come over here and kiss me yea
And make it

Good to me baby
The way it used to be

Can you ignore the pain and sorrow?
A woman's heart begins to get a little numb sometimes yes it does
Will you regret it tomorrow?
Tomorrow may not ever come
So you know you better make it good to me, baby
The way it used to be

Said come on baby
I said come on darlin
Tomorrow may not ever come
No, no, yea

So you better make it
Good to me baby
Oh yea
You better make it
Good to me baby
Oh yea

I said come on baby
Come on darlin
I said make it good
Make it good to me baby

Come on make it good

// Ain't It Hard //

I know a man
He was born to be a poor
It made him so complain now
He decided to settle the score
He hit a bank
Said he'd like taking care of my child
He will leave him high on the hole
But he only left for a little while
Knock at his door
Who could it be
Noone but the Law
And then he put his gun yeah
And he shot the first men he saw
He killed them dead
You know the other men shot back
Now he's living in a wheelchair
Down at Blackpool down on the track

Ain't it hard
It got to be real hard
To get what he wanted

(Let me tell you a little something else)
[?]
(Now listen to the song)

I know a woman
And he hit her every day
You know she won't find no man
She won't find a shepherd just to get hurt
You see she ain't to be
She don't look too wrong now
But her children're hungry
They're hungry as the day is long
You see they put her man
They put him in an institution
Now she ain't got nothing no
She got nothing but a revolution
You see she lost her job
Now she got to try again yeah
You ain't no welfare it
They had to get back on her feet again yeah yeah

Ain't it hard
It got to be real hard
To get what she's lacking...
