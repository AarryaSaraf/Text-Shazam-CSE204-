// How Do I Let A Good Man Down? //

See we've been getting on
So good so far for so long
No, you never hurt me
No, you never gone and done me wrong

I know that something just ain't no good
But you always do exactly what you should
So tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

You gotta believe me
I didn't mean to find nobody else
I don't wanna hurt you
But I gotta do right by myself

You make me happy, but he gives me thrills
You give me comfort, but he gives me chills
So tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

I know that it's crazy
To walk away from such a good thing
But I'm gonna gamble
And I bet that this ain't just a fling

I can't have my cake and eat it too
So I gotta get up and walk out on you
Please tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

How, how do I let him down
I said, I, I gotta let him down
I said, I, I gotta let him down
How do I
How do I let a good man down?
How do I
How do I let a good man down?
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down

// Stranded In Your Love //

Who is it?

It's me, baby

What?

Yeah It's me... It's me, open the door

I thought you left me, what you doing back here?

Listen, baby, they have stole my car

What you mean they stole your car?

I had it parked around the corner and somebody stole my car. Open the door. Open the door, baby

Na na now look Lee, I'm tired of your lies and we done been through this before. And we ain't going through this here again. You hear me?

Listen this is different this time, listen. Just open up the door, open up the door, let me explain to you

What you've got to say for yourself now... hmm?

Check this out, girl

I just came by to get my things
How was I to know some joker would steal my ride?
Now it's past midnight and the bus is not running no more
Would it be asking too much for me to come inside?

Now Lee, I told you
I don't want you around here no more
We both said it was better for a while
If we didn't meet, yeah

Now I understand, baby
But they stole my automobile
After all we've been through together
You can't just leave me out here in the street

Ain't no other way, but to stay
Now I'm stranded in your love
Girl, I just can't hide it, 'cause I'm still inside it
What you do to me
Now I'm stranded in your love
I keep trying to move on, but that old feeling ain't gone
And I'm in misery

Now, I'm gonna let you in baby
But you don't take me wrong
Make me change my mind
I send you right back out this door, yeah

Well, use my phone to call your brother
And if you can't get a ride
I guess I'll make you a bed over here
And you can sleep on the floor, yeah

I don't mean to take advantage
But my brother is fast asleep
When I don't sleep in a bed
I get mighty sore, oh my

Well, I guess there ain't any reason
To be uncomfortable
And if it's just for one night
We might as well do it like we've done before

Is this romance or circumstance
Now I'm stranded in your love
I try and try but I just can't get by
What you do to me
Now I'm stranded in your love
People don't tend to go from lover to friend
It ain't meant to be

Come here girl, let me hug you. I ain't going to try no tricky moves

You know Lee, you always been a fast mover... I knew once I let you in the door you was going to wiggle your way back in...

Mmm mmm this feel good babe, been a long time since I had you in my arms like this

You so slick

Now I'm stranded in your love
There ain't no love like this wretched love
I can only get from you
And only you

Now I'm stranded in your love
I keep trying to move on
But that old feeling ain't gone
And I'm in misery

Now I'm stranded in your love
I, I tried, I tried, I tried
But I just can't find no one
Make me feel like you do

Now I'm stranded

// My Man Is A Mean Man //

He lifts me up to the sky
To watch me fall to the ground
He calls me when he needs me
He leaves me when I'm down

He plays with my love
Just like I ain't got no heart
Then he reels me in easy
He says we never gonna part

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

How can I do right
When he don't follow no reason?
I can't tell when he's balling
I can't tell when he's teasing

I try all that I can
To keep from making him mad
What kind of a love
Makes a girl feel so bad

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

When I tell him I'm leaving
I know he's gonna be mad
Ain't got no words he can give now
Than what I've already had

It ain't gonna be easy
To be all alone
My heart is gonna be heavy
But they gonna be my own

And after all
Then I walk out the door
He's still gonna be a mean man
But he won't be my man no more

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Hey

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man

// You're Gonna Get It //

Some love makes you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some love makes you do right
And some love make you do wrong

Believe me when I tell you
I got the kind of love
That's gonna make you higher, baby
Than what you're dreaming of

And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

Now I'm no professor, baby
But I know a few things
You see, a rooster needs a sunrise
Before he rises up and sings

A fish without no water
Is a fish that cannot swim
And if you want a man to be his best friend
You gotta give him, give your love to him

And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh darling (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

Oh
Some love make you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some love makes you do right
Some love makes you do wrong

If you want to know what love can do
Open up your arms, you won't regret it
I got a mighty kind of love and, boy
You're gonna get it

I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh darling (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it to you, yeah, my love
You're gonna get it

// How Long Do I Have To Wait For You? //

How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Every hour seems like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well, I get lonely, baby, when you're not here

Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

I asked your mama, I asked your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you're going to, baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Or if we're together or are we lost?

Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

How, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Baby, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone? Yeah
How long, yeah, baby tell me, how long
Do I have to wait for you, honey?

// Your Thing Is A Drag //

Ain't no need to ask me, baby
'Bout what time I'm coming home
And ain't no need to ask me, baby
About when and where I roam

And ain't no need to wonder why
I like to come home late
You know I'll never do you wrong, baby
But you'll have to contemplate, well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

When we're at the party, baby
You're always asking when we're gonna go
Now didn't you hear me when I told you, baby
Ah, we were stayin' for the whole show

And when I'm singing at the club
Son, you never wanna come
Hey, and when you come, you're always askin' me, child
Baby, when we're gonna be done? Well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

You're always getting wound up
When you should be loose
When the rest of us are drinkin' and smokin'
Aw, you're sittin' at the bar and you're ordering juice

Well, you're always whinin' and whinin'
About the time that I don't make
Ooh, but when I try to make it good to you
It seems the time that you're head starts achin', well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

You know your thing is a drag
You know your thing is a drag, yeah
Ah, your thing is a drag, baby
You know your thing is a drag

// Fish In The Dish //

I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

I remember when an old man said
Fish tastes better when it's fresh off the line
But I can tell you that it tastes even better
When I know that the line was mine (line was mine)

I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

You can take me down to Restaurant Row
Serve me salmon in a champagne wine
Ain't nothin better, baby, you can buy me
That tastes as good as when the line was mine (line was mine)

Yeah, talkin' 'bout some fresh broiled fish
Fish you catch yourself by your own two hands
Nothin' tastes better than that fish, aw
Till you've had some, you don't know what you're missin'

I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

Well, ain't nothin like your own
And eatin' the fish you just caught fresh that day
Nothing tastes better than your own fish yeah, haha
Tastes good, now just get the fork in it
Just cut it open and, mmm yeah

I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine, yeah
I got fish layin' right there in my dish
And it's mine, it's mine it's mine, yeah

// All Over Again //

You think after all this time, I wouldn't be surprised
You think there'd be nothing new when I looked into your eyes
You think there ain't nothing about you that I ain't realized

But every time I see you
But every time I see you, darlin'
But every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

How many times I thought I knew you better than no one could
How many times I thought I'd love you more than any heart would
How many times I thought these things but I misunderstood

'Cause every time I see you
'Cause every time I see you, darlin'
But every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

And the years may come passing by, yeah
We're gonna get old, wrinkled and gray
But I can't think of nothing better
No better way to pass the time
Then falling in love day after day after day

After all the love we made you'd think that we'd be tired
And after every part of you I've kissed and I've admired
After all that we've been through, we ought to be uninspired

But every time I see you
But every time I see you, darlin'
Every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

Fallin' in love again
I'm fallin' in love again
I'm, I'm fallin' in love again, oh yeah
Well, it feels like I'm fallin' in love all over again
Feels like I'm fallin' in love all over again
Fallin' in love all over again
