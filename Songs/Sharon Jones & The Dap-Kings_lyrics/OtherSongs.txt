// Goldfinger //

Goldfinger
He's the man, the man with the midas touch
A spider's touch
Such a cold finger
Beckons you to enter his web of sin
But don't go in

Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death from
Mister Goldfinger
Pretty girl beware of this heart of gold
This heart is cold

Golden words he will pour in your ear
But his lies can't disguise what you fear
For a golden girl knows when he's kissed her
It's the kiss of death from
Mister Goldfinger
Pretty girl beware of this heart of gold
This heart is cold

He loves only gold
Only gold
He loves gold
He loves only gold
Only gold
He loves gold

// I'm Still Here //

Left my home in North Augusta at the age of three
My mother, big brothers, two sisters, and me
She brought us to New York City to set herself free
From all the fightin', screamin', and misery... yeah
But New York in 1960, no peace to be found
Segregation, drugs and violence was all around

But I'm still here
I'm still here
Mmmmm yeah

All the things I've been through
Just to sing this song
All the people I've seen come and go
As I kept pushin' on
I had to work as a prison guard telling men to do what they were told
'Cause some record label told me I was too fat, too short, black and old
I had to direct the choir to let my voice out
That was the only place I could sing and be proud

But I'm still here, yeah
I said I'm still here

From the ghetto to The Garden
From the ballrooms to The Bow
From Down Under to Great Britain
I played so many drinkin' holes
Then the big sea crashed down on me
Tried to take it all away
And I didn't know if I would live
Live to see another day

But I'm still here, yeah
I said I'm still here
I'm still here

I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
I didn't let nothin' get me down
Sometimes you got to let those little things go
