Album: ILookToYou

// Million Dollar Bill //

Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh
They played our song, we hit the floor, he held me strong
And we danced the night away

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Aww, baby"

It's been a long long time
Since I felt that love has found my way, oh, oh, oh
I've been lookin' (Looking)
I've been searchin' (Searching)
For the man to touch this place
Oh, oh, yeah

Can't deny the way that he's making feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill (If he makes you feel)
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Aww, baby"

If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air
Say, "Yeah" (Yeah)
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air (Oh yeah)

If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill (If he makes you feel)
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Aww, baby"

Ohh
Oh, if he makes you feel
Oh, if he makes you feel (yeah, yeah)
C'mon and say
C'mon and say
Ohh
Oh, if he makes you feel
Oh, if he makes you feel
Aww, baby

// Nothin' But Love //

Ooh, ahh, baby

Here I sit by my window
Thinking about all the things that I've been through
There were times where I never thought
I would get to where I got to
Had one angel to guide me
Some who just violated my love
Now this is my chance to say, ain't got nothin' but love

For my family that raised me (Shout out, shout out)
And my teacher that done praised me (Shout out, shout out)
To anyone who tried to hate on me, yeah (Shout out, shout out)
Even the one's who tried to break me
Even the one's who tried to take me down

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take your dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

I could hold on to pain, but that ain't what my life's about
I ain't blaming nobody if I ain't got my stuff worked out
I got a love for my self, ain't gonna regret anything I've done
I just wanna sing my song, ain't got nothin' but love

For all the players on the street (Shout out, shout out)
To all my ghettos doing y'all thing (Keep on, keep strong)
To all my exes that done wrong me
Stepped on me, can't hold me down

There's been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take your dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now, oh
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya

To all the givers and the takers
To my crew from way back when (Way back when)
To the goers and the stayers (Oh yeah)
And the ones that I ain't met
For myself for sticking with me
For the one's I miss from up above (Oh)
Anyone who's ever been a part of me
Ain't got nothin but love (Nothin' but, nothin' but)
I got nothing but love

There've been haters since this world been going 'round
(Nothin' but love)
Why they take your dream and try to crush 'em down?
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
I ain't even tryna hold on to that now
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love for you)
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)
Ain't got nothin' but, nothin' but love for ya
(Nothin' but love, nothin' but love)

// Call You Tonight //

Whoa (Oh)
Oh (Hmm)
Whoa (Whoa, oh)
Oh (Hmm, yeah)

The stars must be aligned tonight
I believe this has to have a meaning
Lightning had to strike tonight
'Cause the two of us are finally meeting
In this place, at this time
And I feel safe when I look in your eyes
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay, but I gotta go

So I'ma call you tonight
I will, baby, just as soon as I get time alone
I'ma call you tonight
I will, baby, just as soon as I get home

That's the way it goes in life
You get busy when you just don't wanna
There's never enough time, day or night
You have to make it so baby

I'm gonna make a way to connect
'Cause your face is one I can't forget
I feel like I know you from another life
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time

I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say (Uh-uh)
How there's so many things I wanna get to know
I wish that I could stay (Stay), but I gotta go

So I'ma call you tonight (I promise, baby)
I will baby (I will baby), just as soon as I get time alone
(Soon as I get time alone)
I'ma call you tonight (I'll call ya, baby)
I will baby, just as soon as I get home (Oh)

Destiny, I believe in it
Meant to be, don't you see it's possible
That for this kind of magic, anything can happen
And if you wanna know, then stay by the phone
Just stay by the phone (Oh-oh)

I can't catch my breath (Oh) 'cause you take it away
For the best writer in town could not find words to say
(Not find words to say)
How there's so many things I wanna get to know (To know)
I wish that I could stay (Stay), but I gotta go (I gotta go, baby)

So I'ma call you tonight (Promise I will, promise I will)
I will, baby, just as soon as I get time alone (Oh baby)
I'mma call you tonight (Call you tonight)
I will baby, just as soon as I get home

// I Look To You //

As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you, I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you, I hear a song
I look to you

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that I've taken, mmm
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gon' make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you, yeah
And when all my strength is gone
In you, I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you, oh yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you, I hear a song
I look to you

My levees are broken (Oh Lord)
My walls are coming down on me (Coming down on me)
All the rain is falling (My rain is falling)
Defeat is calling (Set me free)
I need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you, I can be strong
I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you, I hear a song
I look to you

I look to you
Ooh
I look to you

// Like I Never Left //

Konvict
Akon and Whitney, yeah
(Oh yeah)

Did you ever wish you could get back
Something that you did in your past?
If it wasn't for me, I know what we had
Was definitely gonna last
I admit that we say some things
We don't mean when we're mad
But I realize that I've been foolish
I never should have turned my back

'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone (All alone)
So many times that I wanted to just pick up the phone (The phone)
And tell you ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so
I ain't holding back no more, your girl is coming home

And I want you to love me (Like I never left)
And I want you to hold me (Like I never left)
And I want you to touch me (Like I never left)
Come give me what I'm missing, yeah (Like I never left, yeah)

Do you think (Think) we can pick up
Where we left before the day?
That I told you it was over, packed my things
And moved away

'Cause I see (See) that without you
My world is just an empty place
Taking one step away from you feels like a million miles away

'Cause it's a cold world when you're out there all alone (All alone)
So many times I wanted to just pick up the phone (The phone)
And tell you ooh baby, baby, I missed your loving so
But I ain't holding back no more, 'cause your man is coming home

And I want you to love me (Like I never left)
And I want you to hold me (Like I never left)
And I want you to touch me (Like I never left)
Come give me what I'm missing (Like I never left, oh yeah)

I had enough, I miss you bad
What I did, leave in the past
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left (Like I never left)

Oh, said back in the building, back on the block
You and me together, we back on top
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left

I had enough, I miss you bad (I miss you bad)
What I did, leave in the past (yeah)
Yes, your girl is coming back
Like I never left, left

Said back in the building, back on the block
(I'm coming back home, boy)
You and me together, we back on top (Yeah)
Kind of love we got, it just don't stop
Like I never left

(And I want you to love me)
Like I never left
And I want you to hold me
Like I never left
(Oh, and I want you to hold me)
And I want you to touch me
Like I never left (Yeah)
Come give me what I'm missing (Oh)
Like I never left, yeah
(And I want you to love me)

Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, oh, come give me
Like I never left (I never left you, baby)
Oh baby, come love me, come hold me
Come touch me, oh, come give me
Like I never left (I never left you, baby)

// A Song For You //

I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs and made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my live on stages with ten thousand people watching
Well, we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me is what I hoped to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darling, can't you see?
There's no one more important to me?
Baby, can't you see through me?
We're alone now, and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love withholding nothing
(Withholding nothing)
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better, and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody (The melody) 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time (Space or time)
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, oh, remember when we were together
(We were together)
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you (This song, this song)
This song is for you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

I love you in a place, my dear friend
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, ah, you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone (We were alone) and I was singing this song to you

We were alone, and I was singing this song to you
We were alone (Yeah, yeah), and I was singing this song
Oh yeah, singing this song (Singing this song)
I was singing this song, just for you

// I Didn't Know My Own Strength //

Mmm, yeah

Lost touch with my soul
I had nowhere to turn, I had nowhere to go
Lost sight of my dream
Thought it would be the end of me

I thought I'd never make it through
I had no hope to hold on to
I, I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didn't know my own strength

Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

Found hope in my heart
I found the light to life my way out of the dark
Found all that I need, here inside of me, oh

I thought I'd never find my way
I thought I'd never lift that weight
I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
I didn't know my own strength

Survived my darkest hour, my faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

There were so many times I wondered
How I'd get through the night
I thought I took all that I could take

I didn't know my own strength
And I crashed down and I tumbled but I did not crumble
I got through all the pain
Oh, I didn't know my own strength
My faith kept me alive
I picked myself back up, I hold my head up high
I was not built to break
I didn't know my own strength

I was not built to break, no, no
I got to know my own strength

When your love is strong and it comes from the heart
Ain't no man strong enough
Ain't no time long enough to tear it apart
And that's what we had, believe it or not
So on the final day I thought all the hurting pain will end up on top
So I won't cry 'cause you're goin' away
'Cause the chemistry we've got, it don't fade
I won't be wishing for better days
'Cause deep, inside I know our love stays the same

You ain't got nothing to say
I salute you, yeah
Go on, out the door
Now you take care
No more tears to shed
What, you expecting me to beg?
Well, I'm not, I'm done
So when you leave, just close the door behind you

'Cause I'm feeling kind of taller than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, oh lately
I'm feeling kind of better than you
And I know just what to do
I feel like doing my hair (My hair)
I feel like calling some of my friends (Some of my girlfriends)
I feel like goin' to a club and partyin'

'Cause I'm a soldier girl, in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong
I walked for miles, I made it home
It's good to know without you, I made it
Soldier girl, in my world
I took the fall, now I stand tall
From the pain and all, I made it through
And now all I gotta say to you
Salute, ay, ay
Salute, ay, ay

You think you know everything
And you think that your sh— don't stink
Well, it do, hey

To realize that you don't belong here
I can do better
You say I'll never do better
Yeah right, whatever

Don't call it a comeback, no

Through all the drama and the pain
And all the tears
Time to stop this rollercoaster
Say I wanna get off
And start moving mountains, swimming seas
And climbing over walls

'Cause I'm a soldier girl (Solider girl), in this world
I stand alone, I can be strong (Oh)
I walked for miles, I made it home (I salute you)
It's good to know without you, I made it (I salute you)
Soldier girl (Oh), in my world (Oh)
I took the fall (Soldier girl), now I stand tall
From the pain and all (Pain and all)
I made it through (I made it through)
And now all I gotta say to you

I salute you
I salute you
Salute, salute, salute
I salute you
Go on, take care
Go on out the door
Take care
