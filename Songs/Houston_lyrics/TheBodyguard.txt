// I Will Always Love You //

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you
You
My darling, you
Mmm-mm

Bittersweet memories â€“
That is all I'm taking with me
So good-bye
Please don't cry:
We both know I'm not what you, you need

And I... will always love you
I... will always love you
You, ooh

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I'm wishing you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I... will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

I will always love you
I, I will always love you

You
Darling, I love you
I'll always
I'll always love you
Ooh
Ooh

// I Have Nothing //

Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me

Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you

// I'm Every Woman //

Ooh, ooh, yeah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
It's all in me
Yeah

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa

I can cast a spell
Secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear, oh

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa

Oh, I can sense your needs
Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I've got it, I've got it
I've got it, got it, baby, baby

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it, naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa

I ain't bragging
'Cause I'm the one
Just ask me
Ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it

Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, yeah, yeah, got it)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Got it, got it, yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, aah, aah)
I'm every woman (I'm every woman)
I'm every woman (Every need, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Every woman, baby)
I'm every woman (Uuh)
I'm every woman (Every woman, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman
I'm every woman (My girl)

// Run To You //

I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?

Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night, I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh, what's the sense
Of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with?
Tell me, what does it mean?

I wanna run to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I wanna run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?

Run away

I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears, no
If you only knew
How much I wanna run

...to you
I wanna run to you
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
I'll run to you
But if I come to you
Tell me, will you stay or will you run away?

// The Queen Of The Night //

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

Don't make no difference if I'm wrong or I'm right
I've got the feeling and I'm willing tonight
Well I ain't nobody's angel
What can I say
Well I'm just that way
Hey, ey

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, just say it, say it, say it
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

You've got a problem with the way that I am
They say I'm trouble and I don't give a damn
But when I'm bad, I know I'm better
I just want to get loose
And turn it up for you, baby

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah, oh yeah, just say it, say it again
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah (Oh yeah)

I've got the stuff that you want
I've got the thing that you need
I've got more than enough
To make you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh oh, say it again
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Because I'm the queen of the night
The queen of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

// Jesus Loves Me //

(Tells me, tells me)

Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (tells me so)
So (tells me so)

Jesus loves me, this I know

Little ones to him belong
They are weak but He is strong

Yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me (loves me so)
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (tells me so), so glad

Pressing on the upward way
Always guide me, Lord, I pray
Undeserving, and stubborn-willed
Never fail to love me still

Yes, Jesus loves me
Oh yes, Jesus loves me (loves me)
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so (loves me so, and I know)

Yes, Jesus loves me (loves me, loves me, loves me), loves
Oh yes, Jesus loves me
For the Bible tells me so

(I know I am loved)
For the Bible tells me so
(Feels so good to know)
Ooh, that I'm never alone
See, sometimes I'm lonely but never alone, no
For the Bible tells, for the Bible tells
For the Bible, oh Lord, it tells me so (tells me so), so glad (tells me so)

See, I know that He loves me, yeah (tells me so)
Whether I'm right, mm (tells me so)
And whether I'm wrong, oh yes, He did (tells me so)
Oh the Bible tells me, me (tells me so)
Jesus loves me
