// It's Not Right But It's Okay //

Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three â yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah (Ah)

I'll pack a bag so you can leave town for a week â yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh

I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are going to change, baby
'Cause I won't be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that? (Tell me, boy)
See, I'm movin' on
And I refuse to turn back, yeah (Back, back)
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me, ohh

It's not right, but it's okay
Sho 'nuff okay, ha
I'm gonna make it anyway
Make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Pack your bags, get out and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
Don't you dare, back to me, boy
It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ahh
Close the door behind you, leave your key
Close the door, and leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, oh
It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay, baby
I'm gonna make it anyway
I can pay my own rent
Pack your bags, up and leave
Pay my light bill, take care of my babies
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
It's not right, but it's okay
Oh, lord
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
I'm gonna make it anyway
Get up and leave
Close the door behind you, leave your key
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
Pack your bags, up and leave
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
(Things are gonna change)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
('Cause I won't be a fool anymore)
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'm gonna be okay
I'm gonna be alright
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
(There's no more tears left here for you to see)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway

// Heartbreak Hotel //

This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

You said you'd be here by nine
Instead, you took your time
You didn't think to call me, boy
Here I sit, trying not to cry
Asking myself why, you do this to me (Mmm, oh baby)

Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me?
Look what you did to me (Oh, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(Made me cry)
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me

Now I see, that you've been doing wrong
Played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby (Ah)
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out
That you were cheating on me, baby
How could you do it to me?

Since you're not around for me
To tell you, baby, face to face (Mmm-mm)
I'm writing you this letter
And this is what I have to say, oh

All I really wanted was some of your time
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (All you did was lie to me, baby)
Look what you did to me (Can't believe what you did to me, yeah)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me? (Why'd you do it?)
Can't take what you did to me
You didn't have to do it to me, baby

Heartbreak Hotel (Ohh-oh-ohh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Oh-ohh-ohhh)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (I-I, I, why'd you do it? Yeah-ah)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (All I wanted!)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (This the heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Welcome to heartbreak)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel (Yeah, why'd you do it?)
This is the Heartbreak Hotel

All I really wanted was some of your time (Oh, baby)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Ooh, all I really wanted, ahh)
Look what you did to me (It's all I really wanted, baby)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
What'd you do to me?
Can't take what you did to me
I wanted your love
All I really wanted was some of your time (All I really want)
Instead, you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What'd you do to me? (Do me right, can't take it no more)
Look what you did to me (Why did you do me that way?)
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
(Thought you'd do me right)
Until you played with my emotions and you made me cry
(But you made me cry)
What'd you do to me? (Ohh-whoa-ohh-oh)
Can't take what you did to me

I ain't gon' to take it, I ain't gon' take it no more
I ain't gon' to take it, boy
I ain't gon' to take it no more
Everything that you said was a lie
Don't lie to me

Clap your hands, y'all
It's alright
Clap your hands, y'all

And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth, we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what people say (Really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after Judgement Day

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us

// When You Believe //

Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice says "Help is very near!"

There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
Now, you will, you will when you believe
You will when you believe, just believe
Just believe, you will when you believe

// I Learned From The Best //

Did you really think that
I would really take you back
Let you back in my heart one more time, oh, no, no
Did you think that I'd still care
That there'd be more feeling there
Did you think you could walk back in my life
So you found you miss the love you threw away
Baby but you found it out too late, too Late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh baby now)
I learned from you

I remember cold nights
Tears I thought would never dry
How you shattered my world
With your goodbye, your goodbye baby
Would've sold my soul then
Just to have you back again
Now you're the last thing on my mind
Now you say you're sorry and
You've changed your ways
Sorry but you changed your ways too late

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you (Oh baby now)
I learned from you

So when all you've got are sleepless nights
When those tears are clouding up your eyes
Just remember it was you who said goodbye
Who said goodbye

And so you know the way it feels to cry
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
Learned the way to break a heart
I learned from the best
I learned from you
I learned from the best
I learned from you

// Get It Back //

Y'all ready
Uh, Whitney
Darkchild
Uh uh, back
Couldn't get it back, couldn't get it back
Oh no, uh
Yeah, ooh
Check it out, c'mon

Remember when it all began
We were all in love, uh
Then came the friends
Telling you when
Your time for me was good enough
I constantly had to compete
With your crew and their schemes
Remembering back in the day
I used to mean everything

(If we could just get it back)
To the way it used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change with you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

Now tell me why so many nights
You had so much to do, baby
When you said bye
Sometimes I tried
I tried to make you choose
Now tell me how you can allow
Your boys to control, darling
The time we shared
It was unfair
But now you need to know

(Now if I told you)
That I'm moving on
(Boy, what would you do?)
Oh, things just ain't the same, nah nah na-nah
(We were supposed to)
Oh baby, conquer everything, yeah yeah now
(Boy, let me tell you)
You've got to make a change, oh boy

(If we could just get it back)
Oh darling, to the way we used to be
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

(If we could just get it back)
Can we do it, can we do it, can we do it, can we do it now, baby?
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me, boy
(I remember how it was)
And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back, babe

Remember how we used to dance?
I liked the way we used to dance
Girl, let me see you dance
Just dance with me, dance with me
Remember how we used to dance? (can we do it, uh?)
I liked the way we used to dance (can we do it, boy?)
Girl, let me see you dance
Just dance with me, dance with me

Oh-ooh, come on now

Nothing would change for you and me, boy

And I know that for a fact
(We were oh so deep in love)
If we could just get it back

(If we could just get it back)
Oh, to the way we used to be, baby
(My only wish would be that)
Nothing would change for you and me
(I remember how it was)
Back to the way we used to be, baby
(We were oh so deep in love)
I remember, I remember, ooh-oh
If we could just get it back

(If I told you)
(If we could just get it back)
Oh Lord, just get it on back to the way it used to be

(Boy what would you do)
(My only wish would be that)
If we could just get it back, uh

Show me, show me, show me, show me
If we could just get it back

If we could just get it back
If we could just get it back

// Until You Come Back //

I lost my heart
A long time ago
You made me feel
Like no one had before
Boy you made me love you
Then you walked out the door
See I will not rest
Until you say I am forever yours

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up and
You've got to feel something I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
'Til you come back to me baby
Until you come back (to me)

Don't care how long
It's not important to me
Don't care how far
Love's never too far for me (no, it ain't)
I just might be crazy
When it comes to my heart
But I can not rest
Until the day we're no longer apart

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up and
You've got to feel something I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
'Til you come back to me baby
Until you come back (to me)

Nobody plays with my heart
You can't walk away from it all
You can run but your heart cannot hide
Because it knows you belong in my life

And boy I won't stop at nothing
I won't give you up and
You've got to feel something I know
I will not love again
Until you come back
Come back to my arms
Until you come back to me baby
Until you come back to me

// I Bow Out //

I'm tired of playing this game
And I won't play it no more
And I won't take it no more
Through with being your fool
And I won't do it no more
And I won't, I won't keep up this act
Not for one minute
I'm going to pull, I'm going to pull this curtain down, no

This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out (I won't be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out (I won't be staying 'round, baby)
I bow out

Can't go on with the show
You're just a stage I went through
Now you're just fading from view, yeah babe
It's time for a change of scene
Guess I'll be taking my leave
I guess I won't, I won't stay in this play
Not for one minute
I'm going to make, I'm going to make my exit now
Oh baby

This time I won't play this game (This time I won't)
I made a vow to make a change (Made a vow)
And I bow out (I won't be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline)
And I resign the masquerade (oh)
And I bow out (I won't be staying 'round, baby)
I bow out

When you're left standing on that stage all alone
Maybe you will realize
You should of learned to treat me right
And when this final act is finally through
Maybe you'll wish you'd been
The kind of man you should have been
Now watch me say goodbye
And walk right out of your life
Oh baby, all right babe

This time I won't play this game (This time)
I made a vow to make a change (This time I made up my mind)
And I bow out (I bow, I won't be hanging 'round, baby)
I decline to take the pain (I decline boy)
And I resign the masquerade (No more staying out)
And I bow out (Gonna bow out)
I won't be staying 'round, baby

This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change (Said I)
And I bow out (I gotta bow out, do you believe it?)
I decline to take the pain (I need you to hear me)
And I resign the masquerade (Do you hear me baby?)
And I bow out (I won't be staying 'round, baby)

This time I won't play this game
I made a vow to make a change
And I bow out (Ooh-ooh-ooh baby I bow out)
I decline to take the pain (I said I bow out)
And I resign the masquerade
And I bow out

// You'll Never Stand Alone //

If there's a time when the tears should fill your eyes
And you can't see past the shadows
To the sun on the other side
Don't despair, because there always will be
Someone there
Don't lose faith, love won't let you lose your way
Because

You, you'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

If there's a day when the rain should find your heart
And you're cold and tired and lonely
And this world has you in the dark
Don't be scared, you can just reach for me and I'll be there
Don't lose hope, love will see you through you know
Because

You, you'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

Standing by to lift you above all the hurt and pain
Standing by to carry you through all the tears and rain
Reach for me, I'll be with you
Reach for me, I'll see you through
See I'll be the one to hold you
The one to show you that you

You, you'll never stand alone
I'll be standing by
I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

I'll keep you from the cold
I'll hold you when you cry
I'll be there to be strong
When you can't find the strength inside
And you, you'll always have a home
In these arms of mine
You'll never stand alone
Love is standing by

// I Was Made To Love Him //

Hey, oh, hey hey hey
See I was born in Newark (sure was)

We were always hand in hand
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales
Nip wore her pigtails
I knew I loved him even then
You know some disapproved it
They even boohooed it
But I told them time and time and time again

You know I was made to love him
Build my world around him and
Hey, hey, hey
He's been my inspiration
Sho' nuff appreciation
For the love I gave him through the years

Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My love grew sweeter through the years

I know my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years

I was made to love him
Worship and adore him, yes say
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, oh Lord

All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh

My baby loves me
My baby needs me
I know I ain't going nowhere
I was just a little thing
The love bug hit me
I had the fever with each passing year

If all should tumble
And the whole world crumble
By his side I'll still be standing, yeah

Because I was made to love him
Made meant for him, say
Hey, hey, hey
I was made to love him
Build my world all around him say
Hey, hey, hey

I love my baby
Nip ain't' going nowhere
Say hey, hey, hey
