// Who Would Imagine A King //

Mommies and daddies always believe
That their little angels are special indeed
And you could grow up to be anything
But who would imagine a king?

A shepherd or teacher is what you could be
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king?

It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring

Who would imagine?
Who could imagine?
Who would imagine a king?

Mmm hmm

// The First Noël //

The first Noël, the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay tending their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noël, Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel

Jesus Christ is
Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel

Noël, Noël, Noël
Born is the King of Israel

Jesus
The first Noël
He is the Son yeah
Born is the King of
King of
Oh yeah yeah
Oh Christ is born
Ooh hallelujah hey
He is born
Oh Christ the King is born

// The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire) //

(Ooh well ooh Lord)
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire (well)
Jack Frost nipping on your nose (mmm)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe (well)
Help to make the season bright (mmm)
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

(Scats)
You know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
Everybody's mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas (scats)
Happy Chanukah
Happy Kwanzaa
Merry Christmas to
To all of you
Merry Christmas to everyone

// One Wish (For Christmas) //

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

If there were no presents
Waiting on Santa's sleigh
What would I wish
For Christmas
And if Frosty, the Snowman
Were melting away
I would pray for hope and unity
On Christmas day

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one

If Rudolph and his reindeer
Ran into delays
I'd still hope for joy
This season, yeah
And if somehow Santa
Got lost on his way
I would try to find a way to smile
Smile on Christmas day, oh

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

You know it ain't about
All those material things, no, no
What you've got to think about
Is the love Christmas brings, yeah yeah

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

If I had one wish for Christmas
There would be joy and peace here on earth
If I had one wish for Christmas this year
We would all come together as one, oh yeah

// Cantique De Noël (O Holy Night) //

O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth. (Oh yes it is now.)
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O o night when Christ was born
O night
O holy, holy night
O night divine

Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O o night when Christ was born
O night
O night
O holy night
O night divine
Mmm

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know
It's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Oh oh ah I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Oh Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

If only yeah
Well now, if only, only, only, only
If only in my dreams
If only
Well, well, well Lord
If only oh
If only in my dreams
