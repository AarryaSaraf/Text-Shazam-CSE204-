// Matter Of Time //

Oh yeah

It's a matter of time
Before justice will come
It's a matter of time, yeah
Before all wars will be done
It's a matter of time
Before wrongs will be righted
It's a matter of time, yeah
Before all people will be united

Let's not wait any longer, yeah
Gonna struggle on so hard
All together we get stronger
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

Oh yeah

It's a matter of time
This is a song about peace
Just a little bit of time
Until freedom will mean free
I don't mean one side beating the other side
I mean no more sides
I'm talking about unity for all people
Woah, just a matter of time!
I can't wait too much longer
My frustration's near its end
I can't hate 'cause I am stronger
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

Oh yeah
C'mon, (hmm hmm)
Soon we'll have a peace of mind
In a matter of time
I can't wait too much longer
Will this world ever get better? (hmm hmm)
It's just a matter of time

// Sail On! //

Oh No

Well look who's here
Won't you come on in?
It's been a long long time
How you been?

Oh no
Tell me it ain't so
Someone threw you out
You got nowhere to go

Wait a minute
I don't suppose
You might recall
When I came knocking at your door
You said "sail on"
You told me to sail on
You told me to sail on
You told me to sail on

Wait a minute
If I do to you what you did to me
Tell me, tell me, where would we be?
Two people stranded without a helping hand
Two people stranded without a friend
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
You and me, we're gonna sail on

// Just Give Me Your Time //

Oooo
Oooo

I don't need your promises
I don't need your lies
I don't need your tears
I don't need your sighs

Just call me your baby and I'll love you over again
Just give me your time

I'm outside your door
I don't mind the rain
I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting
For an end to this pain
Just let me in baby and I'll love you over again
Just give your time

Oooo
Oooo

Don't worry baby
I won't break your heart
I can be gentle
Like I was at the start
I'll love you over and over and over again
Just give me some time
Give me some time - oh yeah
Just give me some time
Just a little time

// Come And Be A Winner //

Seems like you've been wasting time
Trying to find your place in life
You need to get your ducks all in a row
Stop acting so peculiar
Get on boy, I won't fool ya
Follow me; I'll show you what you don't know

So take some time to understand
That life's a race for each and every man
Sometimes people will treat you like a worn out shoe
But they don't know that you can't lose

Now if you seem to get off track
I'll be there to get you back
Don't you worry, I'll be in your corner
When the chips are stacked against you
Just remember that I'm with ya
Keep on moving right past the finish line

So take some time, understand
That life is a race for each and every man
Sometimes people will treat you like a worn out shoe
But they don't know that you can't lose

Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Be a winner, just a winner
Be a winner, just a winner
Now you're winner
You're a winner, yes you are!
Beause you got me, yeah!

// Rumors //

Rumors
I heard a rumor about you
And they tell me that you're no good
Are you my one and only
Can you show me
You got to show me
Don't tell me that you're uptight

Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I want to know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmmm
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I got to know baby
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby

Promise
Are you a man of your word
Or are you playing
Players get what they want
That's what they told me
But what they told me don't matter
When you hold me

Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmmm yeah
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I want to know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Uh, I wanna feel it inside
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmm yeah, I gotta feel it inside
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I got to know

// Pass Me By //

Baby there's something that is on my mind
But I really don't want to say it
Baby, I know all the games you're playing
But I'm getting so tired of playing them

The cost of my love for you is getting too high
I'ma save myself and say

I think you better pass me by
You can go your own way
Do what you got to do
You can go your own way, baby
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, too

Baby, I thought that it would last and last
Sometimes the ending just comes too fast
Sad when the end it comes too late
Shame to see a good love turn hateful

The cost of my love for you is getting too high
I'ma save myself and say

I think you better pass me by
You can go your own way
Do what you got to do
You can go your own way, baby
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, too

(Pass me by)
I think you better pass me by
(You can go your own way)
You can go your own way
(Pass me by)
(You can go your own way)
Do what you go to do, oh
(Pass me by)
(You can go your own way)
Gonna do, I got to do
(Pass me by)

// Searching For A New Day //

Simple sounds are in my ear, coming from a radio
Oh no - where did all the good times go?
In the daytime all I am is a working fool
And in the nighttime I'm trying to keep my cool
I know that people say (Gotta be a better way)
But there ain't no golden goose that'll get you paid

Through the hard times
Can't sit on the sideline
(You know we gotta get ahead)
I'm gonna keep on trying

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I hope you find it)
I know I'll find it

If I find what I'm looking for, I could rule the world
A brand new superstar, once an ordinary girl
And with my newfound fame, I could lend a helping hand
To all those in need, however I can
Since you know just what I'm looking for
Maybe you can be the one that can open up the door

Can you hear me knocking?
And everyone is thumping
(We're just trying to get ahead)
I'm gonna keep on trying

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I know you'll find it)
I know I'll find it

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I know you'll find it)
I know I'll find it

// These Tears (No Longer For You) //

(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
(These tears are no longer for you, baby)

No more tears shall I weep
Or cry myself to sleep, oh
So long; I'm moving on
These tears are mine to keep
(But don't cry)

Oh, it's so hard (When I think about you, baby)
Whoa, I fall apart (When I'm without you, baby)
Then I know I must (Carry on)

(I won't cry)

(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
These tears
Are no longer for you baby

I cried away the pain for so long
I sat there and played the fool
Farewell to what was wrong
No more do they belong to you
(But don't cry)

Oh, it's so hard (When I think about you, baby)
I fall apart (When I'm without you, baby)
But I know I must (Carry on)

(I won't cry)

(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
These tears
Are no longer for you baby

// When I Saw Your Face //

Looking at your picture, baby
Brings back sweet memories
Of all the good times we had together, baby
Just you and me

I didn't believe in love at first sight
Kept telling myself, "This can't be right"

(When I saw your face, I knew that I was in love)
When I saw your face
I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
(When I saw your face)
I was in love
(I knew that I was in love)

The gleam in your eyes
Sent little tingles down my spine
But then you smiled and looked at me
And I was frozen in time

Didn't believe in love at first sight
Kept telling myself, "This can't be right"

When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
I was in love
Ooh oh
Love!

Ooh
When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
I was in love
And when I
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
Knew I was in love

// Girl! (You Got To Forgive Him) //

(Girl! Are you crazy?)
Are you gonna let true love slip through your hands?
Are you gonna let the (the little things)
Get in the way of a good loving man?
You've got to (open up your mind)
You must (forgive and forget, girl)
You got to (listen to the man)
His heart is filled with regret

I know he did you dirty
But I'm begging you (Listen to this song)
It's a shame to lose a love so strong

Girl, you got to forgive him
Girl, you got to forgive him
Before it's too late

(Girl! Are you crazy?)
Are you gonna let true love slip through your hands?
Are you gonna let all (the little things)
Get in the way of a good loving man?
It was so long ago (Another time)
You were so far away (Another place)
It was a one-time thing (One time)
Don't let his love slip away

I know he did you dirty
But I'm begging you (Listen to this song)
It's a shame to lose a love so strong

Girl, you got to forgive him
Girl, you got to forgive him

// Call On God //

You know your life gets filled with so much sorrow
And it seems like there's no tomorrow
In these times that we live here today
Seems like everything is in your way

You just call, call on God
And He'll be your friend
Just call, call on God
And He'll carry you through
Just call, call on God
And He will provide
Yes, He will (Yes, He will)
Provide
For you

I made up my mind to be with Him all the time
And I won't let nothing turn me around
To be like Him is what I long to be
And to share His love to eternity

You just call, call on God
And He'll be your friend
Just call, call on God
And He'll carry you through
Call, call on God
And He will provide
Yes, He will (Yes, He will)
Provide
For you
