Album: HelloBroadway

// Hello Broadway //

You gotta have dreams, gotta have hopes
Gotta have faith when you're on the ropes
Someday that dream is gonna come true
And when it does, I'll say to you

Hello Broadway, how do you do?
I've waited a lifetime to say "hi" to you
Hello Broadway, here comes me
Oh, hello Broadway, look at my grin
I'm glad you decided to let me come in
Hello Broadway, here comes me, ha

And those who fought me will say they taught me
Everything I know
They used to boo me, now they say they knew me
Hello Broadway's opening nights
Thank you for my name in lights

Hello Broadway, I like your style
Now that I'm here, I'll stay for a while
Hello Broadway, here comes me
Alright, hey

Each show I start out working my heart out
And that's how I'll always stay
I'm not above it 'cause I love it, I love it, I love it
Hello Broadway, open wide
Here comes Mister Starry Eyed

Hello Broadway, I like your style
Now that I've made it, I'll stay for a while
Hello Broadway, can't you see
Broadway, you and me

// People //

People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world 
We're children, needing other children 
And yet letting a grown-up pride 
Hide all the need inside 
Acting more like children than children 
Lovers are very special people 
They're the luckiest people in the world 
With one person one very special person 
A feeling deep in your soul 
Says you were half now you're whole 
No more hunger and thirst 
But first be a person who needs people 
People who need people 
Are the luckiest people in the world 
With one person one very special person 
No more hunger and thirst 
But first be a person who needs people 
People who need people 
Are the luckiest people in the world

// The Party's Over //

The party's over
It's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up the piper must be paid

The party's over
The candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night

It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over
It's time to call it a day

Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

It's all over, my friend

// On The Street Where You Live //

I have often walked down this street before; 
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before. 
All at once am I 
Several stories high,
Knowing I'm on the street where you live. 

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town? 
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town? 
Does enchantment pour 
Out of ev'ry door? 
No, it's just on the street where you live! 

And oh! The towering feeling 
Just to know somehow you are near! 
The overpowering feeling 
That any second you may suddenly appear! 

People stop and stare. They don't bother me. 
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be. 
Let the time go by, 
I won't care if I 
Can be here on the street where you live.

// What Kind Of Fool Am I? //

What kind of fool am I, who never fell in love? 
It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinkin' of! 
What kind of man is this, an empty shell? 
A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell! 

What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss? 
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this? 
Why can't I fall in love like any other man? 
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am! 

Why can't I fall in love like any other man? 
And maybe then I'll kno' what kind of fool I am!

// My Kind Of Town //

This is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of town
Chicago is my kind of people too
People who smile at you and

Each time I roam
Chicago is calling me home
Chicago is why I just grin like a clown
It's my kind of town.

My kind of town,
Chicago is my kind of town,
Chicago is my kind of raz-ma-taz
And it has all that jazz and

Each time I leave,
Chicago is tuggin' my sleeve
Chicago is a Wrigley Building
Chicago is the Union Stockyard
Chicago is one town that won't let you down
It's my kind of town

// Days Of Wine And Roses //

The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
Through a meadow land toward a closing door
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before

The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you

(The lonely night discloses) just a passing breeze filled with memories
Of the golden smile that introduced me to
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo

// This Is The Life //

This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, you're there.
This is the life,
You've waited long enough,
Man, you've arrived,
Breathe in that air.
Modern perfume,
Silver and candlelight,
Children, make way,
Joe's here to stay.
Come join the club,
Hear that sweet music start,
This is the life, sweetheart.

Tell them bye-bye,
Get where the action is,
Come have some fun,
I'll lead the way.
This is the life,
They've kept you in a box,
Break down the walls,
Come out and play.
See all the lights,
They're spelling "Wellington,"
How sweet the song
When you belong.
Top of the heap,
That's how it's got to be,
This is the life, you'll see.

This is the life,
Here's where the living is,
This is the life,
Baby, I'm there.
This is for me,
Free, black and twenty-one,
Now Ive arrived,
Breathe in that air.
This lovely life,
This groovy atmosphere,
Out of my way,
Joe's here to stay.
King of the hill,
That's how it's got to be,
This is the life for me.

// My Way //

Little man you've had a busy life
Guess I've had my share of joy and stride
They gave me the rules
And I really tried
But somehow I'm not satisfied

So my way, this time it's gonna be
My way, this time it's got to be
Just what I feel just what I chose
Mine if I win, mine if I lose

But my way no more the shy little guy way
No more uncertainty
This time it's me without a doubt
I'm gonna see what I'm all about
And I'm gonna do it my way

Stop the music
I wanna lead the band
Maybe I'll waste and fall on my face
But I wanna be in command

My way they'll be no compromise
My way I'm gonna fall or rise
I got the plan and I got the drive
I'll be a man whose glad he's alive
Glad to live my life my way

// Hello Dolly! //

Hello Dolly!
This is Marvin, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of your old favorite songs from way back when

So take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello, Dolly!
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong

I feel that room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favorite songs from way back when

So golly gee, fellas
Have a little faith in me, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Fellas, she'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away again

// Walk On The Wild Side //

Sinner, hear what I'm sayin'
Sinner, you've been swingin', not prayin'
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against goin' to heaven, six-to-one

You walk on the wild side, the Devil is waitin'
He's waitin' to take your hand
You walk on the wild side, you're walkin' with Satan
Away from the Promised Land
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

You better cross over, you better walk humble or you're gonna stumble
And Satan is waitin' to take your hand
You walk on the wild side, you walk on the wild side
Away from the Promised Land
One day of prayin' and six nights of fun
The odds against going to heaven, six-to-one

The odds against going to heaven six-to-one
