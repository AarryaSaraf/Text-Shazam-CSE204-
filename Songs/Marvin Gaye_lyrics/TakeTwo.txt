Album: TakeTwo

// It Takes Two //

[Her:] One can have a dream, baby
[Him:] Two can make that dream so real
[Her:] One can talk about bein' in love
[Him:] Two can say how it really feels
[Her:] One can wish upon a star
[Him:] Two can make that wish come true, yeah
[Her:] One can stand alone in the dark
[Him:] Two can make the light shine through

[Chorus (Both):]
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Me and you, just takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
To make a dream come true, just takes two

[Her:] One can have a broken heart, livin' in misery
[Him:] Two can really ease the pain like a perfect remedy
[Her:] One can be alone in a car, on a night like these all alone
[Him:] Two can make just any place seem just like bein' at home

[Chorus]
[Instrumental]

Just takes two, just takes two

[Her:] One can go out to a movie, lookin' for a special treat
[Him:] Two can make that single movie somethin' really kinda sweet
[Her:] One can take a walk in the moonlight, thinkin' that it's really nice
[Him:] But two walkin' hand-in-hand is like addin' just a pinch of spice

[Repeat chorus and fade]

[BOTH:] I love you, yes I do 
I love you, yes I do 
[KW:] I know you know it's true 
From the way I look at you

You need me, I need you 
[MG:] Darlin', darlin', I'm never blue 
Since I first laid eyes on you

[KW:] I guess you knew it 
[MG:] From the start 
From the way you took my heart 
You're the one girl that I adore

I must be wherever you are 
You set my world, set my world on fire

Much kissin', holding too

// It's Got To Be A Miracle (This Thing Called Love) //

[KW:] All it takes is 2 hearts that care
[MG:] Sprinkle just a little tenderness there
[KW:] And like the tiny grains of sand that build a mountain so high
[MG:] Each tender moment builds love between a girl & guy

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] Take a boy like you & a girl like me
[MG:] 2 lonely people we used to be
[KW:] We shared a little time, tears & laughter
[MG:] It seems that we will be happy ever after

[KW:] All it takes is 2 arms that know
[MG:] They gotta hold you, baby, & never let go
[KW:] Throw in a lover's quarrel & it's sealed with a kiss
[MG:] We know that heaven must be like this

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] I used to wander, I used to roam
[MG:] Like a ship in a stormin' sea, tryin' to get home
[KW:] When we found each other, heaven found a way
[MG:] 'Cause you were the dawn of a bright sunny day

[KW:] All it takes is just a little time
[MG:] 3 little words, baby, that mean "Will you will be mine?"
[KW:] Add a few tears 2 lovers will shed
[MG:] & every sweet word that's ever been said

[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love
[KW:] Take a girl like me & a boy like you
[MG:] Long lonely hours we once knew
[KW:] We have each other & live what life's worth
[MG:] All love is strong enough to move heaven & earth

[repeat & fade]
[BOTH:] It's got to be a miracle, this thing called love
Never never never let go, this thing called love

// What Good Am I Without You //

[Both:]
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Her:]
What good would a rose be if the raindrops didn't fall?
What good is a telephone if there's no one to call?
What good is a wedding if no one says "I do"?
Tell me, baby what good am I without you?

[Both:]
Wo oh wo oh, wo oh wo oh

[Him:]
What good is a flier if he don't have a plane?
What good is a doctor if he can't cure the pain?
Tell me, what good is a sweetheart who proves to be untrue?
What good, baby, am I without you?

[Him:] I'm no good without you, and there's one thing I know
[Her:] I just got to have you, darling, 'cause I love you so
[Him:] What good is living without the one you love?
[Her:] And what good is the heavens without the stars above?
[Him:] What good is a true heart that proves to be broken in two?
[Both:] [Repeat and fade:] What good, baby, am I without you?

// Til There Was You //

There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
'Til there was you

There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
'Til there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Til there was you

Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
'Til there was you
'Til there was you

// Love Fell On Me //

[MG:] I used to go my way all by myself, me, my shadow & I 
Happy-go-lucky, nobody else but me, my shadow & I 
One day out of the clear blue skies 
I dared to look in your eyes 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me, yes indeed

[KW:] I used to laugh at all my friends 
Gettin' ready for Valentines Day 
Givin' candy & kisses & friendship rings 
"Sweets for the sweet," they say 
One day when the sun was warm 
I couldn't help but take you in my arms 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me

[MG:] Listen, Kim: it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks 
But I felt it just the same 
[KW:] Marvin, love came creepin' right into my heart 
When you whispered my name 
So sweet & tender, I had to surrender 
I knew I had really been hit 
[BOTH:] So tenderly, that's how love fell on me 
So tenderly, that's how love fell on me

[MG:] I couldn't help myself at all 
[KW:] You know, you came along & I had to fall 
[repeat & fade]
[BOTH:] So tenderly, that's how love fell on me

// I Want You 'Round //

Every day that passes by
I think about the new love you found
And my eyes cloud up and cry
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round

I spend my saddest moments
After the sun goes down
That's when my heart starts aching
'cause I want you 'round
I want you round

No matter where I travel
In the country or a town
My lips call out your name
'cause I want you 'round
I want you 'round baby
I want you 'round
I want you 'round

// Heaven Sent You, I Know //

[Backup singers:] Heaven must have sent you, I know

[Her:]
Every night I say a prayer
Before I go to sleep
Suddenly you were there
Your face so fine, your voice so sweet
In these arms of mine
I found you just in time
In this turn of the world
I was a lost and lonely girl
But then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)
I know (yes I know)

[Him:]
Funny how my empty heart
Used to feel like a heavy load
Suddenly you were there
Like a friend on a lonesome road
Right into these arms of mine
I found you, I found you just in time
'Cause I was a lonely man
Holding out my helpless hand
Then a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)

[Both:]
Our time is here now
Now matter how the world is around
In your arms I find
Some kind of love and peace of mind
'Cause a miracle happened;
Heaven must have sent you, I know
(Yes I know)

// When We're Together //

[KW:] Just a simple movie matinee 
[MG:] Yeah baby, or sittin' across from you at a cafe 
Hey hey oh, it's such a special special treat 
[KW:] Each moment breathlessly sweet 
[BOTH:] That's the way it is when we're together 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[KW:] Even when we casually roam 
[MG:] Oh baby, down by the countryside & back home 
It seems to make up for the time we spend alone 
[KW:] Oh Marvin, when I talk with you 
I'm lookin' forward to 
[BOTH:] When we're together 
[MG:] Baby, when we're
[BOTH:] together 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[KW:] Oh there's a smile on my face 
That Old Man Trouble can't erase 
[BOTH:] That's the way it is when we're together 
[KW:] Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[MG:] Oh baby
[BOTH:] when we're together 
[KW:] I like it, ooo yeah 
That's the way it is

[MG:] Darlin', darlin', you're the apple of my eyes 
[fade]
