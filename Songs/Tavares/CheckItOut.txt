Album: CheckItOut

// If That's The Way You Want It //

Oh, we've come to the end of our road
Somebody's gonna be goin' (I've got to be goin')
We've been trying just as hard as we can
But the emptiness is finally showing

If we let it go another day
There'll be only bitter words to say
And so we've worked out fine, we've laid it on the line
You're still a friend of mine

If that's the way that you want it
Oh baby, you got it
If that's the way that you see it
Oh darlin', so be it
I'll never give you a reason
To show me to the back door
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before

Well, I've taken a last look around (Look around)
And there's nothing I hope I'm forgetting (I've got to be goin')
If you happen to find my guitar
Then I'll let you know just where I'm headed

There's a little bit of you inside
I'll be taking along for the ride
I guess I feel the same, nobody is to blame
I'll go the way I came

If that's the way that you want it (You want it)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it (You got it, you got it, you got it)
If that's the way that you see it (Oh, see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh, darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me to the back door (No, no, no, no)
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before

It's pretty clear that I've been hanging on too long
And when I've ever been like this, I moved along
Well, girl, I won't stand in the way
I've worn my welcome out
I've been right here so many times
I know what I'm talking about
Hey, hey, hey, baby

If that's the way that you want it (You want)
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it (You got it, you got it, you got it)
If that's the way that you see it (Oh, see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me to the back door (No, no, yeah, yeah)
If that's the way that you want it
Well, I've been there before (Oh, yeah)

If that's the way that you want it
Oh baby (Oh baby)
You got it
If that's the way that you see it (You see it)
Oh darlin' (Oh darlin')
So be it (So be it)
I'll never give you a reason (I'll never give you a reason)
To show me (No)

// Strangers In Dark Corners //

Strangers in dark corners
True love in disguise
I can't help myself, Lord, I want her
I'm doing things against my pride

But love has come again
To what was a lonely man
Should I
Just forget the joy for which she holds
Ignore my heart, let my mind take control, and lie

Alone, we're just strangers in dark corners
Two hearts on a lover's heart
Four eyes staring at each other
Desperately searching inside

Looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just strangers, Lord, in dark corners

In love, looking for a way to bring joy into their world
Just for one night
After going for days alone with no sleep
Waiting for that opportunity to hide

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just two strangers in dark corners
Two hearts beating fast
We're just strangers in dark corners
Trying to make every minute last

Lord, we're just strangers
We're just two strangers
Oh, in dark corners, yeah

// Check It Out //

If you need a strong hand
To guide you through the night
If you want someone who understands
Then things can't get uptight

If it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out (Check it out)
Oh, check it out (Check it out)

I understand complications
Can sometimes bring you down
A different situation
Doesn't always be around

And if it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out (Check it out)
Baby, check it out (Check it out)

Oh... you know my love is here to stay
And it will always be that way
Look at me (Come on and look my way)
Oh, look at me (My love is here to stay)

Oh... surely you must know
My love will always grow
Can't you see (Look into my eyes, girl)
Mmm, can't you see (Look into my eyes, girl)
Ooh, can't you see (Ain't a big surprise, girl)

There may not be a dreary day
For you to suffer through {No, no, no, no}
If you would let me lead the way
I'd give the world to you

And if it means anything to you
Hey
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Baby, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)

Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes (Ain't a big surprise, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Mmm, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Oh, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)

Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes (Ain't a big surprise, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)

// I'm In Love //

You look as though you model
For New England's Bricks and Tartans
Fashion'ble
The twinkle in your eye
Is so sincere
It's such a joy
Just to have you near, sweetheart

And I can tell by the look on your face
I'm in love

I don't need a sorcerer's book
To let me know you've got me hooked
It's plain to see
The simple way we found
When things are right
You run into my arms
And say, "Hold me tight, my love"

And I can tell by the look on your face, girl
I'm in love

Hey heaven
Oh sweet, my love
You know I'm in love
Can't you see I'm in love
Oh yes, I'm in love

Can't you see
You know I'm falling in love

I give you all I have, baby

Hey sweet, my love
Oh baby
You know I'm in love
Can't you see I'm in love
You know I'm falling in love

Can't you see
