Album: AHerosDeath

// I Don't Belong //

You shoulda heard me in the lounger
Telling people what they was
Spitting out all types of sugar
Just dying for a cause, cause, cause
A smiler slithered to my corner
On a face so true
My word is always in the ready
And I'll attribute that to you

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

You shoulda heard him in the bowery
Learning people with a tongue
Cut from second-hand cloth
Make the women feel young

I heard him serving as a soldier
In the annex of the earth
Threw himself before a bullet
And threw the metal to the dirt
Hear the man's word

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't belong to anyone
I don't wanna belong to anyone

// Love Is The Main Thing //

Love is the main thing
Love is the main thing
Always the same thing
Always we raining

Love is the main thing
Tired of embracing
Always we floating
Never devoting

Love is the main thing
Love is the main thing
Tired of embracing
Using and wasting

Always a longing
Silently hoping
Always we raining
Love is the main thing

Love is the main thing
Love is the main thing
Love is the main thing
Love is the main thing

// Televised Mind //

That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

Swipe your thoughts from Broadway
Turn ideals to cabaret
Water dreams of yesterday
Fall behind
All your laughter pissed away
All your sadness pissed away
Now you don't care what they say
Nor do I

That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

They're all gulls in the sky
They all mimic love's cry
And I wish I could die
Me or them

What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, ya call it, ya call it

That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind
That's a televised mind

That's a televised mind
16 bars for the televised mind
Dublin line for the televised mind
We're all televised minds

What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, what ya call it, what ya
What ya call it, ya call it, ya call it

// A Lucid Dream //

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
And detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed
Direction before you were there
Ah

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed
Direction before you were there
Ah-ah

Under fallen colours gone unthrown
Ah, you're all prone
To being anyone else
Other than you?
Are you all prone?
Does anyone know?
And they just wanna come to your place and see you sing

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the clouds opened up
For the aul' ones to look down
And detail, in books, the affair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed direction

I was there
When the rain changed direction
And fled to play tricks with your hair
Overlooking them, there
And it's all coming back
And you're prowling the track
Like a cat on the back of a chair
And the bulletin board
Was shot up like a ward full of junk
And all kinds of despair
And it's all coming back
And the main thing is that the rain changed direction
Before you were there
Ah

// You Said //

You said
You been on the brink so slow down
Don't get time to think now
You try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating

We both
Have a lot of things to say, don't
Don't get time enough to play, try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating faster

All bears
Meaning to the freaks, who dare live
Life not as a climbing stair, they're
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating

We both
Have a lot of things to say, don't
Don't get time enough to play, try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating faster

With you
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again

With you
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again
It's easy, I'll come again

You said
You been on the brink, so slow down
Don't get time to think now, you try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating

We both
Have a lot of things to say, don't
Don't get time enough to play, try
Operating faster
Operating faster
Operating faster

// Oh Such A Spring //

Down by the docks
The weather was fine
The sailors were drinking American wine
And I wished I could go back to spring again

Now they're all gone
That's life moving on
Some stayed behind to get drunk on the song
And they wish they could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

The noise of the town
The salt in the air
It plays all around but I no longer care
And I wish I could go back to spring again
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring
Oh, such a spring

They try words
And down through the years
It all turns to tears
They don't know
But they try anyway

The clouds cleared up
The sun hit the sky
I watched all the folks go to work
Just to die
And I wished I could go back to spring again

// A Hero's Death //

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Don't get stuck in the past
Say your favourite things at mass
Tell your mother that you love her
And go out of your way for others
Sit beneath a light that suits ya
And look forward to a brighter future

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Sink as far down as you can be pulled up
Happiness really ain't all about luck
Let your demeanour be your deep down self
And don't sacrifice your life for your health
When you speak, speak sincere
And believe me friend, everyone will hear

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Bring your own two cents
Never borrow them from someone else
Buy yourself a flower every hundredth hour
Throw your hair down from your lonely tower
And if, and if
You find yourself in the family way
Give the kid more than what you got in your day

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

Never let a clock tell you what you got time for
It only goes around, goes around, goes around
Take your family name for your own great sins
Cuz each day is where it all begins

And
Don't give up too quick
You only get one line - you better make it stick
If we give ourselves to every breath
Then we're all in the running for a hero's death

Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty
Life ain't always empty

That was the year of the sneer now the real thing's here

// Living In America //

London's fine
Did my time
Threshed the truth
Out the lie

Snowman coal'd
Pigeon holed
Cooed to death
Pilgrim soul

Curtain closed
System froze
Wait for me
Braver be

Dragged old man
Kissed and ran
Licked away
Osprey tan

Living in America
Living in America

London's fun
Been and done
One for all
All for one

Hit the town
Fit the crown
Heavy head
Hanging down

If you don't know
We will not go
Turning your tricks like a newborn gangster

You need not be
Born wealthy
If you care
You're the heir

Living in America
Living in America

A young wind blows
Through your hair
Bald-e-grayed
Some of them stayed

You're about as old
As the last day
You felt young
I dare say

If you don't know
We will not go
Turning your tricks like a newborn gangster

You need not be
Born wealthy
If you care
You're the heir

Living in America
Living in America
Living in America
Living in America

// I Was Not Born //

I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding

All you antiquated strangers
All throwing in the towel
To do another man's bidding

I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding

You won't catch me
No, you won't catch me
Not in your bear-trap loyalty

And you won't catch me
No, you won't catch me sleeping
No, you won't catch me slee-slee-sleeping

'Cause I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding
Ah

I was not born
Into this world
To do another man's bidding
Ah

// Sunny //

Saw you walking in the daytime
On a stomach so bare
Sunny, my life's gone easy
To tell the truth, I don't dare

Met your mother in an early
Couldn't focus on a thing
Suddenly my life was clouded
The phone would all but ring

Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for
(Until a ring was surely called for)
Until a ring was surely called for

Afraid I couldn't make the cut, boy
And it makes me very sad
You'd sooner draft me as a soldier
Than you'd have me for a dad

Into a dream I was tilted
Into a dream I fell
Suddenly my life's gone easy
Where I was I can't tell

Now I don't even see them
Now I don't even see
Happy's living in a closed eye
That's where I like to be

Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell
Where I was I can't tell

Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell
(Couldn't focus on a thing)
Where I was I can't tell
(Met your mother in an early)
Where I was I can't tell

// No //

Give us all you got
You're in love and then you're not
You can lock yourself away
Just appreciate the grey

You have hurt and you have lost
You're acquainted with the cost
The one that comes with feeling deep
You're still paying in your sleep
Yeah

Now you're rolling in the dirt
Playing up to what you're worth
And we know what freedom brings
The awful songs it makes you sing

Don't you play around with blame
It does nothing for the pain
And please don't lock yourself away
Just appreciate the grey
Yeah

Even though you don't know
Even though you don't
You feel, you feel

When you go down to that place
It makes a monster of your face
It makes you twisted and unkind
And all the right words hard to find

There's no living to a life
Where all your fears are running rife
And you're mugged by your belief
That you owe it all to grief
No

Even when you don't know
Even when you don't
You feel, you feel

Even though you don't know
Even though you don't
You feel, you feel
