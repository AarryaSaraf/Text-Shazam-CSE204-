// ' Cello Song //

Strange face, with your eyes so pale and sincere
Underneath, you know well you have nothing to fear
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life where Spring is sprung

So forget this cruel world where I belong
I'll just sit and wait and sing my song
But while the Earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky on the crest of a wave

// One //

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we carry each other, carry each other

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one life
It's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care
One
One

// Rocket To Russia //

Yeah

Well, I don't really like it when you look that way
You know, your always coming over to my place but you never stay
Your not a mean dirty woman, but you know I feel that way

So, I don't really like it when you look that way
Something's on your mind but you just won't say
Are you a mean dirty woman and you know I feel that way

Well, I don't really care about your diamond ring
See you more [?] smoking [?]
Like your on a rocket to Russia, your shit don't mean a thing

She's just coming over from the sunshine state
Just to listen to the people in the sanity parade
Oh, your a big dirty woman, you know I feel so bad

La la la
La la la

Well, I don't really like it when you look that way
You've got a backseat look, I saw you in it yesterday
Your a mean dirty woman, and I know you feel that way

So, I don't really like it when you look that way
You've got a backseat look, I saw you in it yesterday
Yeah your a mean dirty woman, you know I feel that way

// The Black Angel's Death Song //

Myriad had choice of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
What had he to lose?
Not a ghost bloodied country all covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose

And wandering's brother walked on through the night
With his hair in his face on a long splintered cut from the knife
Of GT
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long to his skull
Shrill yell
Shining brightly red rimmed and red lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells

Cut mouth bleeding razors
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool, good buy
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gonna choose, choose again

Sacrificials remain, make it hard to forget
Where you come from the stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame
Choose again
And Rovermans' refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse with the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go

And if epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
And if the stone glances off, split didactics in two
Leave the color of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between if you choose
If you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game

I che che, che che I
Che che che, ka tah koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go

// The Cuckoo Is A-Callin' //

Although the trees ungentle sway
Reflect the temper of the day
Just as lovely as you say
Rain upon my hair is falling
Stirred up as the river flows
The clammer of the bar below
Strings a man, his sentence slow
"The cuckoo is a-callin"
Now

I know this bitter life may feel
Ungentle & at times unkind
It bares within itself the fear
Of being someone else its fine but
You my lovely friend have nothing
But a spine, but a spine
You'll surely take those jabs they throw and drink them like red wine
You swine

// Winter In The Sun //

City boy reaches for the lonely heiress
Shes got a fruit fly buzzing round her head
And the boys are in a pack
They're looking for some some liquor
Coming up with ways to make daddy go quicker
Showing off his dimonds to a down town girl
Her eyes are like stars and they shine like pearls
He gets a kiss of credit and a crank of the engine
Ready now to give his dad all of his attention

I want to see some other places
I want a single resignation from the races
I want to feel it, winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to bring them to the show just to say hello

The heiresses caught a column in the paper 'bout the poor
She was startled by a picture of a kid laid on the floor
She thought about her future didn't want it anymore
So she threw it in the river prayed it never came ashore
She pulled up in a limo and she'd [?]
And throw herself into the ring with people from the scene
As soon as people knew her as the one from Terenure
Who wears her designer mittons while she's helping out the poor

I want to see some other places
I want a single resignation from the races
I want to feel it, winter in the sun
I want to feel my soul coming undone
I want to go back home
I want to sing with all the people I know
I want to see them, go around pleasing
I want to bring them to the radio show
I want to bring them to the show and say hello
Just say hello
