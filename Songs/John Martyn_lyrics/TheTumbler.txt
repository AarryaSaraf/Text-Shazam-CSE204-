// Sing A Song Of Summer //

If you go looking down in the summer
To the village at the bottom of the well
You'll find nice things and butterflies' wings
And policemen's hats as well
The girlies there won't hurt you
'Cause they're all so very nice
There's cats and dogs and bats and frogs
And little pink sugar mice

So come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

And won't you wear your silly trousers
And your funny feathered hat
To come home running down the road
Follow the Cheshire cat
Your friends they will all be there
And they will all be taking tea
So come on laughing down the road
Come on follow me

Come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

Won't you leave behind your city shoes
And lose your bowler hat
Forget about your winter woes
And wipe your eyes on the mat
Won't you leave your green wallpaper
And the clock upon the wall
And lock your doors up one by one
Come running down the hall

Come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on

And if you go looking down in the summer
To the village at the bottom of the well
You'll find nice things and butterflies' wings
And policemen's hats as well
The ladies there won't hurt
Cos they're all so very nice
There's cats and dogs and bats and frogs
And little pink sugar mice

So come along and sing of summer
Sing of summer coming on
Come along and sing of summer
Summer's coming on
Summer's coming on
Summer is a coming on

// Goin' Down To Memphis //

Now when I woke up this morning
My wife she drove me from my door
When I woke up this morning
Wife she drove me from my door
Said go away sweet daddy
I don't need you no more

I turned around, mama
Honey, what's the matter now?
Won't you turn around mama
Won't you tell me, what's the matter now
And I know you don't love me
Why don't you dig me anyhow

Hey, hey, mama
Won't you try me back this one last time?
Please, please, mama
Won't you try me back this one last time
And if I don't do this
You might send me back on down the line

Now mama
Might never see my face again
Now hey, hey, mama
You might never see my face again
Goin' way down south to Memphis
Gonna catch myself a southbound train

// The Gardeners //

Don't go in the flower garden late at night
Because something there is killing all the gardeners
Mistletoe and rosemary and the garlic bud
Won't protect you like it did from the gardeners
Run to your homes, save all your wine
There's a gardener coming

And there is something hanging in the willow tree
Take a look and see if it's the gardener
Carry something silver in your bleeding hand
Whistle and you wish away the gardeners
And run to your homes and save all your wine
There's a gardener coming

And there is something hiding behind the greenhouse door
Take a look and see if it's the gardener
Moonlight never looked so strange to me before
Could those misty shadows be the gardeners
Run to your homes and fly up the stairs
There's a gardener coming

// Fishin' Blues //

I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too

I went up the river by one o'clock
I spied that catfish, so many around
And I got so hungry, didn't know what to do
Reckoned I might catch catfish, too

And I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too

And I went down the river by two o'clock
I spied that ale, just so many around
I got so hungry, didn't know what to do
Ain't gonna catch that ale, not you

And I have been fishing all the time
Won't you come fishing too?
You can bet your life
Your sweet loving wife
Gonna catch more fish than you
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
Here's a little something I would like to relate
If the fish bite, you got a good bait
I'm a going fishing
Yes I'm going fishing
I'm a going fishing too

// Dusty //

Nico, two headed Cuban giant
He's looking with all of his eyes
At the colours that fall through the chestnut tree night
Cos tomorrow in London they rise
And don't you know that I'm dusty, too
Don't you know that I'm dusty through and through

The candy floss lady is looking at me
Though she never has seen me before
She knows that I'm selling, let her buy all she has
And then maybe come back for some more
And don't you know that I'm dusty, too
Don't you know that I'm dusty through and through

Roundabouts roundabout all closing down
And the men of the goldfish are gone
The cars and the arms are all tired now
And the lights on the grass are down
And don't you know that I'm dusty, too
Don't you know that I'm dusty through and through

Nico, two headed Cuban giant
He's looking with all of his eyes
At the colours that fall through the chestnut tree night
Because tomorrow in London they rise
And don't you know that I'm dusty, too
Don't you know that I'm dusty through and through

// Hello Train //

And hello train, it's April fool today
And when you get here, I know you're going to stay
Your letter said you'd travel by the 14:30 line
You'll be on the platform running
Oops, don't you look fine

And hello train, it's April fool today
And won't it be nice to feel you smile
And won't it be nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today

And here comes the gardener, funny little man
He gives me a letter and puts it in my hand
Fumbling with the envelope, and trying to keep cool
Open up the letter, my my, it's April fool

And hello train, it's April fool today
It would have been nice to feel you smile
It would have been nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today

Unwanting to cry, I sigh, I slide away
And would you believe, the man calls out to stay
Look over my shoulder, hello he isn't there
Just a heap of railway clothes and whoops, my girlie's hair

And hello girl, it's April fool today
And isn't it nice to feel you smile
And isn't it nice to feel you loving me
And hello train, it's April fool today

// Winding Boy //

I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name

My name
Winding boy, don't deny my name
Just wake it up and shake it up like sweet Stavin' Chain
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name

Hey mama, mama
Mama, look at Sis
My mama, mama
Mama, won't you look at Sis

Look at Sis
Hey mama, mama, take a look at Sis
She's way down on the levee doing the double twist
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name

Hey little sister
Mama, won't you look at her now
My baby sister
Mama take a look at her now

Look at her now
My baby sister, won't you look at her now
Trying to be a bad girl
Needs me to show her how

Just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
Just a winding boy
Don't deny my name

I'm just a winding boy
Don't deny my name
My name
Winding boy, don't deny my name
Just wake it up and shake it up like sweet Stavin' Chain
Just, winding boy, don't deny my name

// Fly On Home //

You climbed on the train
The window rolled on
So did the tear
And seeing you cry
Was like the very first time, when we parted
In the dews and dusty streets

There alone, I felt the station on my feet
Fly home
And away on down the line
You put your face into the wind
Let your tears fly home

I trod on my way
Past the silly girlie who looked at my shoes
Climbing the street
The evening shuddered in my coat
And I looked where I had been

The train a snake
A chain of people on the rails
Fly home
Like a nourishing breath of sunshine
Twinkle of the houses
Let your tears fly home
Put your face into the wind
Little girlie, let your tears fly home
Let your tears fly home

// Knuckledy Crunch And Slippledee-Slee Song //

Lived on a houseboat when I was young
Very young, oh so young
Every Tuesday, I would feed all the swans
In the sun, oh such fun
Then one day a man was seen
Chugging along on his river machine
It was a boat

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match, and to sing my song

Drank up my milk and gobbled the roll
And a bun, current bun
Counted all the kittens that lived down the hall
Every one, didn't miss one
Jumped up on the deck, looked over the side
Nearly fell in because my eyes
Were so wide, so wide

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song

Looks like uncle Harold comes to visit me
Visit me, visit me
Wish me a happy birthday, because tomorrow I'm three
I'll be three, look at me
Goes into his pocket that looks so big
Pulls out a puppet with the big blonde wig
Big Wig

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song

Ah ha, hee, hee, hee
Knuckledy crunch and slippledee-slee
All I like is to cart along
And to pick a match and to sing my song

// Seven Black Roses //

Seven roses appear in my sight
Shining like black stars in the night
And around them, drops of diamond water float
While between them, on his horse
My friend the devil rode
