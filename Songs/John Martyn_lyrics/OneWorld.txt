Album: OneWorld

// Dealer //

Well I cannot be your lover
And I will not be your friend
Well I know you say you need me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
I just end up getting bored
Cos no-one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Do you think that you could leave me
Could you leave and go away
Just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you
Could I leave and go away
Just for a change of style?

They tell me that they dig my shit
So I sell it to them cheap
They bring their scales and check the deal
Are you scared that I might cheat?
Well you're just the spit and polish on a fat man's shiny shoe
And I think I'd hate them for it
And I think they hate me too

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Well you spend your whole life moaning
Down the telephone for bread
You can't get your sleep for trying
To remember what you said
You come around most anytime
And sell me what you can
What you see is what you get
Catch me if you can

Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in
Let me in, sweet darling
Let me in, let me in

Do you think that you could leave me
Could you leave and go away
Just for a little while?
Do you think that I could leave you
Could I leave and go away
Just for a change of style?

Well I cannot be your lover
And I will not be a friend
Well I know you say you're leaving me
But I have no time to spend
We could talk like this for hours
But just end up getting bored
Cos no one needs a dealer
Just the day before a score

Let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in, let me in
Let me in, let me in

// One World //

Some of us live like princes
Some of us live like queens
Most of us live just like me
And we don't know what it means
To take our place in one world
To make our peace in one world
To make our way in one world
To have our say in one world

If you ain't got two words to say
Then I can't talk to you
No use crying, there's been no crime
I say it's just the way the wind blows
Just the name of the game
The way of the world
The way of the world
Just the way of the world
Just the way of the world

Cold and lonely, cold and lonely
Cold and lonely world, for some
Cold and lonely, cold and lonely
Cold and lonely
Just a cold and lonely world for some

There's one world, like it or not
There's one world, believe it or not
There's one world
There's one world, leave it or not
One world, like it or not
There's one world

Some of us live like princes
Some of us live like queens
Most of us live just like me
And we don't know what it means
To take our place in one world
To take our place in one world
To make our love in one world
Make our way in one world
One world, one world

// Smiling Stranger //

Standing on the corner, got myself in hand
Waiting for the come on
From the come around man
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day

Standing at the airport
With the smile of a saviour
Selling off a piece
Of my favourite flavour
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
I'm a smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day

Take good care of yourself
And don't you worry so
Love is coming for us all
Soon as we think it will
Life is hard
Yes I know, but it's harder still
Loving a smiling stranger

Standing at the welfare
With the payoff in my hand
Waiting for the gimme
From the much obliged man
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
I'm a smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day

// Big Muff //

Well the man upstairs always lends an ear
To the man downstairs, even though he doesn't care
The man up the spiral staircase would love to sympathise
With the man downstairs and the same old phrase

Big Muff, can't you see I've had enough?
God knows you're trying to kill me
Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me

It's like an allergy with no apology
It saps my energy,and denies my integrity
Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me
Good Lord knows you're stifling me
God, Lord knows you're trying to kill me

Well the man upstairs has learned it from his wife
But the man downstairs has got trouble in his life
The man upstairs don't notice what is wrong
Every time he sees his neighbour singing that same old song

Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're trying to kill me
Big Muff, get away with your terrible stuff
God knows you're killing me

This thing is dangerous
I tell you it's serious
No need to be envious
It's bigger than both of us

Big Muff, can't you see that I had enough
Lord knows you're trying to kill me

Well, the man downstairs has moved away for good
Like the man upstairs always knew he would
The man downstairs has moved and gone away
And a girl upstairs every night can hear him say

Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me
Big Muff, can't you see I've had enough
God knows you're stifling me

It's like an allergy
With no apology
It saps my energy
Most cantemperaneously

Big Muff, can't you see that I've had enough
God knows you're stifling me
God knows you're stifling me
Oh lord knows you're trying to kill me

// Certain Surprise //

And now the air is clear, my dear
And you're still here, and so
With a certain surprise
I'll give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Silence has never been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
My sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise

Soft uncertainty but blue
My love
That's how I think of you
And so, with a certain surprise
I give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Laughter has always been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
Sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise

We're too sensitive, my dear
Two fugitives from fear
And so, with a certain surprise
I give you my eyes
Sweet certain surprise

Silence has never been my thing
I'm one of those
I love to shout and sing about my love
My sweet flying dove
There's no one above
Sweet certain surprise

// Dancing //

Oh darling, it's going to be late when I get back home
Can't wait 'til I get back home, you don't want me
Reeling and rocking night all around town
Walking and talking night all around town
Just rolling and rocking night all around town
Let another man take you home
Let another man take you home

Oh darling, I wanted to leave but I had to stay
Boys would have laughed if I'd run away, I've been
Roaming and reeling and rocking night all round town
Been walking and talking night all round town
Been rolling and rocking night all round town
Let the morning bring me home
Let the morning bring me home

Well they say it's all right, we go out all night
Well they say it's all right, we go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancy pancing
I've been dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

Oh darling, I want you to try to understand
If you're leading the life of a music man, you've got to
Walk around and reel around and rock around all around town
Walk around and talk around all around town
Go rolling and rocking night all around town
Til the morning takes you home
Til the morning takes you home

Oh darling, it's going to be late when I get back home
Can't wait 'til I get back home, you don't want me
Reeling and rocking night all around town
Walking and talking night all around town
Going rolling and rocking night all around town
Don't let the other man take you home
Don't let another man take you home

Well they say it's all right, to go out all night
Well they say it's all right, to go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancy pancing
Just been life enhancing, take a chance in
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing

// Small Hours //

Going to get on up and fly away
Go on out for another way
And a new day's dawn
Going to carry on

Keep on loving while your love is strong
Keep on loving 'til your love is gone away

Well you're very lovely, going to take you home
They say you'll be my ruin
Cos I love you so
I just love you so

Keep on loving 'til your love is gone
Keep on loving while your love is strong
All the way
