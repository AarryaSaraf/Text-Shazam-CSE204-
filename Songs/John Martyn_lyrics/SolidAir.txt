Album: SolidAir

// Solid Air //

You've been taking your time
And you've been living on solid air
You've been walking the line
And You've been living on solid air
Don't know what's going wrong inside
And I can tell you that it's hard to hide when you're living on
Solid air

You've been painting it blue
And you've been looking through solid air
You've been seeing it through
And you've been looking through solid air
Don't know what's going wrong in your mind
And I can tell you don't like what you find
When you're moving through
Solid air

I know you, I love you
And I could be your friend
I could follow you, anywhere
Even through solid air

You've been stoning it cold
You've been living on solid air
You've been finding that gold
You've been living on solid air
I don't know what's going on inside
I can tell you that it's hard to hide
When you're living on
Solid air, solid air

You've been getting too deep
You've been living on solid air
You've been missing your sleep
And you've been moving through solid air
I don't know what's going on in your mind
But I know you don't like what you find
When you're moving through
Solid air, solid air

I know you, I love you
I'll be your friend
I could follow you, anywhere
Even through solid air

You've been walking your line
You've been walking on solid air
You've been taking your time
But you've been walking on solid air
Don't know what's going wrong inside
But I can tell you that it's hard to hide
When you're living on
Solid air, solid air

You've been painting it blue
You've been living on solid air
You've been seeing it through
And you've been living on solid air
I don't know what's going on in your mind
But I can tell you don't like what you find
When your living on
Solid air, solid air

I know you, I love you
And I'll be your friend
I could follow you, anywhere
Even through solid air

Ice blue solid air
Nice blue solid air

// Over The Hill //

I'm going away to leave you
Going to leave you in disgrace
Nothing in my favour
Got the wind in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Can't get enough of sweet cocaine
Get enough of Mary Jane
Going back to where I came from
Going rolling back home again
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

I've been worried about my babies
Been worried about my wife
Just one place for a man to be
When he's worried about his life
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Well I'm going away to leave you
Going to leave you in disgrace
Got nothing in my favour
Rain in my face
I'm going home
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill
Over the hill
Hey, hey, hey, over the hill

// Don't Want To Know //

And I don't want to know about evil
Only want to know about love
I don't want to know about evil
Only want to know about love

Sometimes it gets so hard to listen
Hard for me to use my eyes
And all around the cold is glistening
Making sure it keeps me down to size

And I don't want to know about evil
Only want to know about love
I don't want to know one thing about evil
Only want to know about love

I'm waiting for the planes to tumble
Waiting for the towns to fall
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble
Waiting till I see you crawl

Yes it's getting hard to listen
Hard for us to use our eyes
Cause all around that gold is glistening
Making sure it keeps us hypnotized

And I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know about evil
Only want to know about love

I don't want to know anything about evil
Only want to know about love
I don't want to know about evil
Only want to know about love

// I'd Rather Be The Devil //

I'd rather be the devil
Than I would be my woman's man
Yes I'd rather be the devil
Than I would be my woman's man
Cos nothing but the devil
Knows my baby
Nothing but the devil
Knows my baby
Nothing but the devil
Knows my baby's mind

Well I lay down last night
And I was trying to take my rest
Yes I lay down, last night
I was trying to take my rest
But my mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the
My mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the
My mind starts a rambling
Like the wild geese in the west

Yes the woman I love
Oh she's evil all the time
Yeah, the woman I love
She's evil all the time
She studied so much evil
Just to have it on
So much evil
Just to have it on
So much evil
Just to have it on her mind

The woman that I love
Stole her from my best friend
The woman I love
I stole her from my best friend
But I know he'll get lucky
Steal her back
I know he'll get lucky
Try to steal her back
I know he'll get lucky
Steal her back again

// Dreams By The Sea //

No, no, no, no, it can't be true
No, no, no, no, it isn't you
No, no, no, no, it's not the way you are
No, no, no, no, it isn't you
No, no, no, no, it can't be true
No, no, no, no, it's not the way you are

Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the sea

Dreaming you've got a lover
Dreaming I got another
Dreaming that there's a killer in your eyes
Dreaming that you're a user
Dreaming that I'm a loser
Dreaming that there's a killer in my eyes

Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the sea

Dreaming about a place of shades
Dreaming about the ace of spades
Dreaming that that is taking things too far
No, no, no, no, it can't be you
No, no, no, no, it isn't true
No, no, no, no, it's not the way you are

Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the sea

// May You Never //

And may you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

You're just like a great strong brother of mine
You know that I love you true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there's those that do

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

And may you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

Well you're just like a good close sister to me
You know that I love you true
And you hold no blade to stab me in the back
And I know that there's some that do

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

You're just like a great strong brother of mine
And you know that I love you true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there's those that do

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight
May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar room fight
May you never lose your woman over night
May you never lose your woman over night
May you never lose your woman over night

// The Man In The Station //

There's a man in the station and a train in the rain
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain
There's a woman in the dark that's standing apart
There's a love in the man and it's breaking his heart
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's one more circle I'm dying to try
There's a piece of my head and it's asking me why
There's a piece of my heart that's dying to fly
There's a baby in a woman that's waiting to cry
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's got to be a way for a lazy face
To get off and start loving the human race
There's just got to be a way for a crazy face
Get out from under this paper chase
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

There's a man in the station and a train in the rain
There's a face in the mirror that's showing the strain
There's a woman in the dark, that's standing apart
There's a love in the man that's breaking his heart
But it's alright, I'm catching the next train home
The next train home

// The Easy Blues //

Mister jelly roll baker
Can I please be your slave
When Gabriel blows his horn
I'm going to rise from my grave
For your sweet jelly roll
You bake the best jelly roll in town
You're the only man bakes jelly
And you keep your damper down

They say: Can I place an order for three weeks ahead
I'd rather have your jelly than my home-baked bread
'Cause I'm just crazy about you jelly
I'm so wild about your jelly roll
You're the only man bakes jelly
And you keep it in your soul

You can take all my women
You can sure keep them all
I got a brand new secret
That you can't catch on to at all
I'm a jelly roll baker
I bake the best jelly roll in town
I'm the only man bakes jelly
And I keep my damper down

I'm the only man bakes jelly and I keep my damper down
I'm the only man bakes jelly and I keep my damper down

// Keep On //

I went walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on

Walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on

Keep on doing what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say
Keep on baby won't you keep on with me everyday

Keep on baby keep on
Keep on with me every day
Keep on baby keep on
Hmm, every day

Do to me, Keep on like you do
Keep on darling, keep on until we're through

With my lover just the other living day
She said keep on baby keep on
Keep on with my lover just the other lovely day
She said keep on baby keep on

Keep on babe what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say

Keep on little darling
Keep on with me every day

I went walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on

Walking with my baby
Just the other lonely day
She said keep on baby keep on

Keep on doing what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say
Keep on baby won't you keep on with me everyday

Keep on baby keep on
Keep on every day
Keep on baby keep on
Keep on baby day
Hmm...

// When It's Dark //

When I go away I know we sleep alone
And cold together, far apart
And close my eyes and I can feel you there
Warm and easy in my heart

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
I just want to be there darling when you start
I just want to be here darling when you start
I just want to be here darling when you start to fly

Never leave you, couldn't stay away
You've been my best friend for a while
And couldn't leave you, couldn't live alone
I couldn't be without your smile

And I never want to leave you, never want to say goodbye
Oh, I just want to be there darling when you cry
I just to be there darling when you start
I just want to be there darling when you start to fly

And I go away, the sun don't shine so warm
The people smile but not for me
And I go away the nights are twice as long
The wind blows lonely through the trees

And I never want to hurt you, never want to say goodbye
And I only want to love you darling when you start
I only want to be there darling when you start
I only want to be here lover when you start to fly

And I go away I know we sleep alone
Alone and lonely and far apart
And close my eyes and I can feel you there
Warm and easy in my heart

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
Oh I just want to be there darling when you start
Just want to be there darling when you start
I just want to be there darling when you start to fly

When I'm awake the sun don't shine so warm
The people smile but not for me
When I'm away the nights are twice as long
The wind blows lonely through the trees

And I never want to hurt you, never want to see you cry
And I only want to be there darling when you start
I only want to be here lover when you start
I only want to be there lover when you start to fly

Couldn't leave you, couldn't stay away
You've been my best friend for a while
Just couldn't leave you, couldn't live alone
I wanted be without your smile

And I never want to hurt you, never want to make you cry
I just want to be there, darling when you start
I just want to be there, darling when you start
I just want to be there, darling when you start to fly

// In The Evening //

She was the moon and my unveiling
And needed she did watch me grow
Now she's walking where it's shady
Seems so strange to watch her go

And all but the time keeps happening on
Love keeps singing a song in the evening

Slowly fading gently jaded
And sliding evening of my eye
Boats are leaving leaves are crumbling
And autumn's here and trying to cry

And all but the time keeps happening on
Love keeps singing a song in the evening

Going faster getting older
And all the time is just today
Got so many ways to see it
Not so many ways to say

The time keeps happening on
Love keeps singing a song in the evening
