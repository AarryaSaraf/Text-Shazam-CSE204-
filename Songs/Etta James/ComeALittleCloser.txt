// Out On The Street Again //

Again
This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine

What's more
This never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly, suddenly be mine

Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear

What matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again

Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear and oh

What matters, what matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again, again
Never, never again, again

// Let's Burn Down The Cornfield //

Let's burn down the cornfield
Let's burn down, baby, the cornfield
And we'll listen, we'll listen to it burn

You hide behind the oak tree
I want you to hide behind that
You know that old oak tree
Stay, stay out of danger
Keep outta sight, babe, 'til I return

It's so, it's so good
On a cold, cold night, yeah
To have a fire, a fire burnin'
Burnin' warm, warm and bright, oh yeah

You hide behind the oak tree
And I want you to stay out of sight, baby
Get behind that old, old oak tree
And stay, stay, get out of danger, Lord, 'til I return

Let's burn down the cornfield
Come on, baby, let's set fire, set fire
Set fire to the cornfield
And ooh, ooh, and we'll make love, ooh, we'll make love
Ooh, while it's burnin', yeah, while it's burnin'
Get a warm, get a warm, warm fire goin', baby
And we'll make love, ooh, it'll be so good while it's burnin'
While it's burnin', it'll be so, so good, baby
Ooh, ha ha ha, while it's burnin', burnin', burnin'

// Power Play //

What gives you the right hey you
To stand there and tell me what to do
Tell me who gave you the power
To stop me from living like I do
Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

Just one time I'd like to be somewhere where
None of your clever lies fill the air
I'm tired of your frozen smile and your voice of tin
Just might all gang up on you
Turn the knob and do you in

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

This never ending power play
Between jealous greed and vicious hate
Is grinding us like giant millstones
But it can't be our only fate
It's time we got our heads together
And let them know that we're awake

Those in the dark, you know they're no longer blind
They're breaking from your strangle hold on their minds
Those that can see don't need no one to cross the street
Be careful who you're pushing round
They just might find you obsolete

Remember if you plan to stay
Those who give can take away
Don't bite the hand that feeds you

// Feelin' Uneasy //

And oh feeling, I'm feeling, feeling uneasy...

// St. Louis Blues //

My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby he done left, he done left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I, like I feel today
Feelin' tomorrow like I, like I feel today
I'll gonna pack my rags, make my getaway

St. Louis woman in all her diamond ring
She pulls my man around, by her apron strings
If it wasn't for powder and that store-bought hair
You know that man I love, he wouldn't have gone nowhere

I got that St. Louis blues, blue as I can be
My man got a heart like a rock down in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far away from me

My man's, my man's gone
Ooh, he done left this town
He done gone gone gone gone
He done left me, yes he has
Oh daddy, I want my man
But he done gone, he done left
He done left this town

// Gonna Have Some Fun Tonight //

"Who's in town?"
"We sure could, let's do that"
"Yeah, let's go ask Etta"
"Etta, why don't you go out with us?"
"Oh girl, I don't feel too good"
"What's the matter?"
"I just don't feel good, that's all"
"All sounds like man problems to me"
"Doesn't it, girl"
"I can hear that tone, everytime you say na no no, I know that means man troubles and you tell me you better..."
"I just don't feel good"
"Come on and go girl, come on"
"Okay, okay"

(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
Yeah gonna have some fun, gonna have some fun tonight
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)

3am on the floor, strutting his stuff gonna dance till 4
That's Willie out there, waiting to see who he'll cut to
Go fast Willie, go fast Willie, go fast Willie
Have some fun tonight

(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
Yes I am gonna have some fun

Now listen Mr on his horn, run just to pay some more
They're out on the base, never take a look on his face
Find me a man, gonna find me a man, find me a man
Have some fun tonight

(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
Gonna have some fun tonight
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
Gonna have some, gonna have some fun tonight
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)
(Ooh wee, ooh wee, gonna have some fun tonight)

[St. Louis Blues]
My man got a heart
Like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man, he got a heart
Like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man, I said my man he got a heart
Like a rock cast down in the sea
My man, my man yeah, he got a heart
Like a rock cast in the sea

// Lovin' Arms //

If you could see me now
The one who said that she'd rather roam
The one that said she'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now

If I could hold you now
Just for a moment I could really make you mine
Just for awhile turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now

I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain
Take any comfort that I can
Looking back and hoping for a freedom from my chains
And Lie in your loving arms again

If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely night
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

I've been too long in the wind too long in the rain
Take any comfort that I can
Looking back and hoping for a freedom of my chains
And lie in your loving arms again

I can almost feel your loving arms again
I can almost feel your loving arms again
