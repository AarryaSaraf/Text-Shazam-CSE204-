// Steal Away //

Ooh, I gotta see you somehow
Not tomorrow, but right now
I know its late, but honey don't make me wait
So come on, baby, steal away
Oh let's steal away

Don't make me start thinking
'cause I might change my mind
My folks are sleeping 
so please don't waste no time
I know it's late but please don't make me wait
So come on steal away
Please let's steal away

I know its wrong, it's wrong needing you this way
But there's no other way I can be with you
If only my folks, if only my folks they would approve
Things like this we wouldn't have to do

Ooh I won't tell, I won't tell anybody else
I'm gonna keep it, I'll keep it to myself
I know its late, but oh don't make me wait
So come on and steal away
Oh I'm asking you to steal away

Because I need you, I need you by my side
Oh I need you baby, I need you to be my guy
Let's steal away right now
Ooh'..

// Just A Little Bit //

I don't want much, no no
I just want a little bit
I don't want it all babe
I just want a little bit
Just a [?] little bit of your love

Turn your lights down low
And, honey, slip me a kiss
Turn your lights down low, baby
Come on, I can't resist
I wanna a [?] little bit of your love

Oh, please right now honey
I can't wait now
Baby just gimme, just gimme a little bit of your love now
I don't want, please, can't wait now

I want you forever
not just for peace of mind [?]
Please say you never leave me baby
Not 'til the end of time
Oh just a t[?] bit of your love

Oh gimme [?] bit of your love
I don't want much
I want a little bit of your love
Gimme some more, gimme a little taste right now
Please, please right now, I can't wait
Baby just a little bit a little bit a little bit, right now right now
