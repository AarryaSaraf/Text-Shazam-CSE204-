// I Wish Someone Would Care //

(Oh-oh)
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah

The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes, too
And I wish, oh, I wish
How I wish someone would care

Sitting home alone, thinkin' about my past
Wondering how I made it, and how long it's gonna last
Success has come to lots of them, and failure's always there
Time, time waits for no one, and
I wish, how I wish someone would care

(Oh-oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ah ah
(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh oh oh ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Some folks think you're happy
When you wear your smile, but
What about your tribulations, and, uh
All of your trials?
Smiles, smiles hide lots of things...

The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes too
And I wish, oh I wish, how I wish
How I wish someone...
Someone would care

Oh oh oh, oh oh ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, oh oh ah ah

// Loving You More Every Day //

I'm lovin' you more, more, more now
Lovin' you more every day, oh yes I am
I'm lovin' you more, sho' 'nuff now, in every way now-ow-ow-ow-ow

Oh, you got me so I can't eat, got me so I can't sleep a wink
Everybody gonna start talkin', askin' what are you, what are you doin' to me?
I tell 'em you're makin' me love you more, more, more, more now
Oh, lovin' you more every day, oh yes I do

I said, I wanna love you, I wanna love you
Oh, not only on weekends, I wanna love you every day, oh yes I do
And not just for a boyfriend, oh
I want you to marry me and take me home to stay

And if I get you, I'm gonna have a full time job
I'm gonna work hard all day
'Cause when you come home, when you come home to me, little boy
I know, I know, I know I'm gonna get my way
For lovin' you more, more, more, more, more
More every day

Yeah, and if I get you, if I get you, I'm gonna treat you right
I'm gonna love you day and night
And if you argue and if you fuss at me
All I want to do is just squeeze you tight and keep on lovin' you
More, more, more, more, mmm every day

// I Worry 'Bout You //

I worry 'bout you
When you're gone, I get blue
So, darling, take care
Oh, I worry about you

I'm home every night
Wondering if you are alright
I knew when we met
Oh, I'd worry about you

You matter to me
You matter to me
So much, so much, so much, so much
I don't know
My soul, my soul's in your hands
Wherever you go, oh, oh, oh

Whatever, whatever you do
Come on home
Come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
Oh, oh, oh, I don't worry about you

Oh, oh, oh, you matter, you matter to me
You matter to me
So much, so much, so much, so much
I don't know
My soul, my soul's in your hands
Wherever you go, oh

Whatever you do, whatever you do
Come on home
Come on home when you're through, yeah
You're mine, you're mine, don't forget
Oh, I don't worry about you

Oh, I worry about you
