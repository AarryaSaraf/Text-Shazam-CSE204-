// GhettoMusick //

[André 3000:]
Whoo, turn me up, don't turn me down
Cut me up, don't let me down, find, find a way

Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

Climbing out this hole (Climbing out this hole)
With a frown on my face
(In the place to be) In the place to be
And not to be at the same time

G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out, without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Big Boi and Patti LaBelle:]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

[Big Boi:]
Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
As my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse, she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip hop standard destroyer
Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
He from the dirty, now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth, this
Planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You've obtained, you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy
'Cause if it's not, we gotta fight like

[André 3000:]
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K, stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, just know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank, then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk, I wish Grandma could see us

Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick

[Big Boi and Patti LaBelle:]
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you, you?
I just want you to know how I feel
Feeling good, feeling great
How I feel
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?

// Unhappy //

[Unnamed Man and Big Boi:]
Drowning in the gray cell
To dwell in earthly hell
A pimp warrior fell
One-two! Sir Lucious L. Left Foot in the motherfuckin' booth!
Lucious! Sir Lucious!
Sir Lucious Left Foot, has just entered

[Debra Killings and Sleepy Brown:]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Big Boi:]
First rule in this thang: never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em be a threat
And your feelings you must protect 'em, as well as your rectum
Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way
Let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail
Bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell
You thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case
Nobody to take your place, family members at stake
Too late to escape and get on the run

[Debra Killings and Sleepy Brown:]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Big Boi, Sleepy Brown, Debra Killings:]
Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many but had enough to get by, enough to get fly
Only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the (hot sauce!)

[Debra Killings and Sleepy Brown:]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

[Big Boi and Debra:]
1979, Dirty South, local lounge
(Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what done used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit
Graphic, language, mild violence and the silence of the the fams
No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said
We executed the dungeon plan 'cause we got that (Hot sauce)

[Debra Killings and Sleepy Brown (Debra):]
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
(Flip that smile upside down now)
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done
When your goose is cooked

// Bowtie //

[Sleepy Brown, Big Boi:]
Girl you cut up (Lucius Left Foot)
Girl you know you cut up

[Sleepy Brown and Jazze Pha:]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

[Big Boi:]
Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys
To the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
What you mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where I

[Sleepy Brown:]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac

[Big Boi:]
Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line through the glass window, glance
We look fine, right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play

[Sleepy Brown:]
Everybody's watching 'cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Feel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why
I got the ladies in line, because they can't deny
So raise your hands to the sky, 'cause we super fly

Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah

// The Way You Move //

Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Big Boi:]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Sleepy Brown:]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

[Big Boi:]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

[Sleepy Brown:]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

I like the way you move (I like the way you move)
I like the way you move (Ooh, you're so sexy baby), wooo
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way (Ooh, baby)

// The Rooster //

Hold up
Oooh, oooh, ooh
Somebody done told you wrong

OK, I started out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
Like a candle in the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died, therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end, you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a party? Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s puss, I said puss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, smash and turned it timid
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swole
For the most, most part, you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the signs

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas, now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son, he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed, I can't dismiss the matter of the fact
Because he saw you and me argue, now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax

Tapes, CDs, baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing? (Wax)
Tapes, CDs, baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

Tapes, CDs, baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Wax, tapes, CDs, baby please, you make me want to scream
You're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?
Throw your fuckin'

Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out

// Bust //

Ghosts and goblins run amok
In the caverns of rhine
Slinging petty corruption
The seventh sign!

Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

[Big Boi:]
Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care!
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was underprepared
But my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!
You scared?

Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

[Killer Mike:]
I officially do it with duns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My Uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Beretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast, my coast the South!!!

Yeah!!!!!!!
Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!
Bust...bust!

// War //

Now get the fuck up off me nigga

As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed to propose a toast to players on every coast-a
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender
'Stead of watching these sucker MCs
I'm seeing just how they're lying to the general population
Don't be patient, get up and stand up for your life
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined
To the situation, we facing, 'cause in time, tick tick boom

Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom
Tick, boom.. tick, tick-boom

"You're gonna die here"
"You're gonna die here"

When will we all, awake up out this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man acting as if he was the supreme being
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who making us ill, they're making us kill
That's making me spill my guts (chill big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got fucked
The media shucked and jived now we stuck – damn!

"Can't be heard clearly"
"You're gonna die here"
"You're gonna die here"

Operation Anaconda – ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got their answer for ransom
As we read together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listening
I'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
Now eat nigga!

// Church //

Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meaning to all of this?

[Sleepy Brown:]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
(Hall-le-lu-jah)
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
(Hall-le-lu-jah)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
(Hall-le-lu-jah)
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
(Hall-le, lu-jah)

[Big Boi:]
Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hold
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no Ps to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they're living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning
But—what about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me – what are we here for?
OW!

[Big Boi:]
Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying
What about repentance?
What about detention?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
What about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

[Sleepy Brown:]
Sometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me – what are we here for?
Ow!

But you know
It's Dungeon Family all day long baby
We finna break it off with some fresh new shit

[C-Bone:]
This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part 'cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz, riding like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I auctioned a bitch off like a nigga playing rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rapping lame like they're drug-related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?

[Big Boi:]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Lil' Brotha:]
You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots, I'm giving hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we making noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's gon' drop
Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks
We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

[Big Gipp:]
They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Strudel
Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle, Mr. Cockerspaniel in your Poodle
After school tutor, Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows
Swimming in the Fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Talk to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft with me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk with me now, talk with me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now I'm out with me now

[Big Boi:]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Supa Nate:]
I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck with me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed, bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the streets mayne
I just tell it how I see it nigga, facts is facts
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props
Konkrete, Big Boi, beating through your Speakerboxxx, yeah!

[Big Boi:]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

[Ludacris:]
Ludacris, yeah I keep a Glock in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
So hear ye, "Get the fuck on the ground!"
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe that we'll stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you wanna romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs
Still wild is my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
Denenen, A hundred thou, bitch! Diamonds shimmering
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
Or with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

[Big Boi:]
Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
From embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Fourth and goal, should I take the three point field goal
For the score, or should I roll around and take the ball
Up the middle, the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed, now we got seven more
Points on the board, fa sho
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player pimp gangster poet, we gon' spit it, we gon' show it to yo ass
"You're a champion," were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say, "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?"
I say, "People, stop the madness 'cause me and Dre, we okay"
OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spitting it damn near 10 years, why the fuck would we be quitting?
Fuck nigga!

// E-Mac (Interlude) //

From Texas to GA, niggas bleeding your speakerbox
Playas stayin' throwed, ho, putting diamonds off in your socks
Blowing killer, sipping lean, and dropping screens
North Dallas and Aquemini, fool
It's all the same team
It's all the same team
It's all the same team

// Knowing //

[André 3000:]
Brothers on the block knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Sisters at the crib knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Preachers at the church knowing, but still get by
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Teachers at the school knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Babies on the bottle knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)

[Big Boi:]
Well, here's a formal introduction
Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly like In Living Color's Wanda
(Word up!)
Now, everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb
Or fall victim, I will overcome
Any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort, so make it last
For the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life
Your dignity the only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing ya butt booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong!

[André 3000:]
Brothers on the block knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)

Babies on the bottle knowing
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)
Junkies on the corner knowing, but still get high
(From this point on it only gets rougher!)

[Big Boi:]
Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job
She would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard
A massage, you could drill her like a sarge
She would charge and rob, pick through your pockets
She got the trick's watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget, you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously, there was a knock on the sliding glass door Bitch, it's me!
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped, now I'm getting in your shit!

[André 3000:]
Brothers on the block knowing

// Flip Flop Rock //

[Big Boi, Killer Mike and JAY-Z:]
Yeah
ATLien style on y'all ass
Do or die, Aquemini
Killer Mike-Roc-A-Fella collaboration—holla!
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

[JAY-Z and Big Boi:]
Young Hov in the place to be (Woo!)
Big Boi in the place to be (Young!)
André 3000 (Kast!) Shout out to public housing (Bitch! Holla!)
I brought the whole hood with me
You got red dirt in your afro
Young Hov' in the place to be (Yeah, yeah)
OutKast in the place to be

[Big Boi:]
Did you ever think that you would be the nigga on the block?
Didn't have to break a steering column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call you (Ugh)
Never judge a person or a book by its covers (Yeah)
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself, boy
Are you black, white, Asian?
Indonesian or Borean—that's black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathing
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seeing
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it 'cause they're scared we're gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power (Power)
The cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height (Ugh)
Because I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga (Bitch)
Might clap a cap at a sucka-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thang whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kents, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my mama but Andre is just the same (Ooh)
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce, dos, deux, a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's and Tuffskins
One minus one; negative one minus negative one is nothing (Ugh)
Busting D-boy raps and player poems
The 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd, original material while you bore 'em
Your live show consists of everybody's shit but your-uns
Do your own shit! In your live show (Biting-ass nigga)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[JAY-Z:]
Young Hov' in the place to be (Woo!)
Big Boi in the place to be (Ugh, Young!)
André 3000 (Kast! ) shout out to public housing (Bitch! Holla)

[Big Boi:]
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eyes Wide Shut, before I asked to hit her gut
If you brunette, Legally Blonde, I might respond
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond
Antwan raps on, raps on
Clap-off, clap-on
I switch the flow so quick, you cannot fathom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea
And try to grab one line or sentence
Rhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist
And give him a clean bill of health
Wealth might make you look good, but you sound like shit
And your team looking shitty to death

[Killer Mike and Big Boi:]
My nigga Big Boi said:
"Watch 'em as they gawk and they gander
You can follow, or lead like Commander Picard
You can have 'The Whole World'
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand!"
This young player's rhyme
I forego'd the crime and I focused on rhyme
Focused on every word and line
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm
The epitome of raw rhyme
Got signed, got serious about the craft
Of raw rhyme and I got mine—Aqueminis
Murderous monster, move minds
Spit it so hard that it oughta be a crime
When you see I'm coming, holla "One-time," holla "One-time"
When you see I'm coming, holla "One-time" ("One-time")

[JAY-Z:]
Young Hov in the place to be (Woo!)

[Big Boi, Sleepy Brown and Debra Killings:]
Don't you like to groove in your hoopty
In your old flip-flops or choose to wear your tennis shoes?
Does it matter to you
That OutKast, we got that skunk for y'all
Keep that pump for y'all

[JAY-Z:]
When I'm in the mood I rock the S. Dot tennis shoes
As a interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops
And I fix it up like gin and juice when I'm in them interviews
Dudes wanna know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
"Where the million dollar watch at?" Stop that!
"Why that? Why this?" Niggas wanna hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane (Woo)
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin' (Ugh)
Understand what I'm saying?
Hov and OutKast, what you think about that?
Really don't matter though what you niggas chatter though
Anybody get out of line, then you trust
That the MAC'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap (Rrrat!)
Got you chilled for that alone
Back on the shit, back on the strip
Another hit, I'm not gon' miss

[Big Boi, Sleepy Brown and Debra Killings:]
Don't you like to groove in your hoopty
In your old flip-flops or choose to wear your tennis shoes?
Does it matter to you
That OutKast, we got that skunk for y'all
Keep that pump for y'all

[Big Boi:]
Y-Yeah

// Interlude //

Ten years long, ten years strong
Lastin' long, verses long lastin'
Education, however, the difference between the two
Which do you live, yourself?
Luck of the draw, master plan without a flaw

Somethin' lastin' long leaves the compromising position
Everything that isn't becomes questionable, unbelievable, and becomes weak at some point
Done got straight blowed after hitting some danker's joint

Somethin' long lastin'
Big Boi and 'Dre, the duos who chemistry gave a potion of rare fate:
Two Atlanta boys that became men of this industry
For them same ol' boys to be OutKast, raps out-blast and outlast the peers of the game
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool you
S'all that it is, believe in the dirty Southernplayalisticadillac-funky-ATLiens:
Together, makes Aquemini
Big Boi and 'Dre presents OutKast
So get ready to bump 808-style
To "The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below"
Two albums, but same ol' flow
Y'all enjoy it, y'hear?
Signin' off, man
AKA
Flossin' man [?]

// Reset //

[Big Boi:]
Nah nah nah
That's part of the
That's, yeah
I got ya good that time, shawty

[Debra Killings:]
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

[Big Boi:]
Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception 'cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living, breathing, soon we'll be teething
Our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Little Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months
But Uncle Darnell and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint
Reset

[Debra Killings and Khujo:]
Start over again (That's right)
(That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right)
Everything happens for a reason (No that ain't)
Good doesn't come without pain (Blood thicker than water)
(Come on, come on, it's for real shawty)
Start over again (We gots to do it all over again)
(We gots to do it all over again, golf club goodie)
Everything happens for a reason (Golf club goodie, uh, uh, yeah)

[Khujo:]
Good doesn't come without pain
Meaning, before it get better, it's gon' get worse
Like my homies on the sick side still dying over turf
That don't belong to urse; I mean us, left in the dust
Try to catch up with massah
I used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus
Of them crackers, but Ephesians 6:12
Said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against
Principalities, powers of this world
Rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places
So throw on the whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
And brothers that wax fat and forget all about the struggle
Yeah, come on, come on, guess what, guess what
Time to reset this thang

[Debra Killings and Khujo:]
Start over again (Uh, 2 triple zero, 2k ain't to dang old)
(Golf club goodie, Big Boi)
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

[Cee-Lo:]
Listen to me, I awaken to sunlight
That's beyond bright; this day will be done right
There is a war just waitin' on the other side of the door
But I'll be bringing God to the gunfight
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right?
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right?
You can handle if tomorrow never come, right?
You get used to singin', if only for one night
But I intend to raise two daughters and a son right
And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this
So open wide for my opinionated opus
Stop playing Go Fish, but not below this
Before I go, I thought that you all should know this
Recognize and realize before any regretting
Before you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting
Hmm?

[Debra Killings:]
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason

// D-Boi (Interlude) //

Talkin' hanging out wit' the D-Boi's
You know you a D-Boi
'Cause when someone frontin' something 'S like havin' two daddies
One time my home boy fronted me a 8 ball at 3 o'clock
At 4:30 he wanted the money back

It's rough bein' on that thang man
How you gonna front me somebody done fronted you?
He ain't no real real hustler, the dude shootin' at both of us
Hit you wit' a quarter pound talkin' 'bout 'we coming up'
A real D-Boi know you gotta get you own work
And you don't get high off your own supply
'Til later on at night

I gotta drop of 'bout 30 keys
Car keys

No Ferrari, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz

Act like I'm the hater, the Haitian from Hateville

Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon' get paid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirty Dungeon [?] has informed me the drought has ended today
With no delay
And a, four piece grizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place for a petite face to lay

Them boys so wild, don't crack no smile
Closet like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles
Popped tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for 'em to swallow
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mack Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mack Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
It's trouble all up in you dear!

He say he loved this ol' coke-strung-out stripper bitch
Why he so dumb?

// The Love Below (Intro) //

Some say Atlanta
Some say New York
Some say Paris France but, who knows
Where this flower grows

// Love Hater //

Everybody needs a glass of water today
To chase the hate away
You know you've got company comin' over
So you scrub extra hard
And everybody needs somebody to love

Before it's too late, it's too late
Oh, don't nobody wanna grow old alone

Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders
And scratch their dandruff
And everybody need to quit actin' hard and shit
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck out ya!)
And everybody needs somebody to love
Before it's too late, it's too late

Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love
Love hater, love hater
Hater of love

Everybody needs someone to love

Everybody needs someone to love

// God (Interlude) //

God
Come in, God
God, come in, God
Damn, you're a girl? Wow
I guess the reason I'm talkin' to you tonight is
Because I've been doin' a lot of thinkin' and
And I consider myself a pretty cool guy
And I've never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, well, except that one little time in Japan, but
That was just some head, and head don't count, right?
Ah, thanks God, I knew you'd understand
Well, I just feel like
Well, to be honest with you
God, I just need a sweet bitch
You know somebody not too
Not too fast, but not too slow
'Cause I don't have it all my damn self
And life ain't easy
You know, you just want somebody by your side
To help smooth that thang out, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
And at this point, I mean, I'm not bein' picky
She doesn't even have to have a big ol' ass, you know?
Just something well proportioned to her body
You know, a nice little tail, you know?
What? You say you, you say you found somebody?
Is she cute? So when do I get to met her?
Oh God, you're the greatest
Well, I guess I'll talk to you later
Amen
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
A-lady

// Happy Valentine's Day //

[André 3000:]
My name is Cupid Valentino, the modern day Cupid
And I just want to say one thing

Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
I don't think y'all heard me
I just wanna say Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
Can y'all dig that?
Now when arrows don't penetrate, see (Cupid grabs the pistol)
Uh, yeah, now, now lookie here
He shoots straight for your heart, now, and he won't miss you
But that's alright, y'all won't believe in me anyway, but

[Joi, Screechy Peach and André 3000:]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's all this talk about Santa Claus, but see
Love will rule supreme

[André 3000:]
Happy Valentine's Day (Every day the 14th)
You got it, when Cupid knocks at your door (You can't ignore me)
There's no need to run
So, Happy Valentine's Day, hey (Every day the 14th)
Now I may have it all wrong, see
If you know what love means, well
Well, somebody tell me
'Cause they just don't believe in me

[Joi, Screechy Peach and André 3000:]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy leprechauns or groundhogs
No, thank you, Easter Bunny
There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see
Cupid will not be defeated

[André 3000:]
Happy Valentine's Day, every day the 14th
Now, I know your hearts have grown cold
And that bothers me
Now, I understand, 'cause I used to be a bad boy in my day
I know you tryin' to protect your lil' feelings
But you can't run away
Ho-oh

[Joi, Screechy Peach and André 3000:]
Ya won't believe in me
But you would fancy
Hey, don't you supposed to be
Some kind of player, or something?
Bunny

[André 3000:]
Well, keep on running, player
'Cause I got my good shoes on
And I got 'em tied up tight
So you gon' find out tonight

Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, "Of course!"
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?

[Joi, Screechy Peach and André 3000:]
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's
Happy Valentine's Day (Happy Valentine's Day)
Happy Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day (Fuck that Valentine's Day)
Fuck that Valentine's, fuck that Valentine's
Fuck that Valentine's Day

// Spread //

I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

I, I can't read minds, but I can read yours
I think she says that she wants to pour
Your, your, yourself all over me
What you think? I could be wrong, but pupils don't lie
And if they do, by God, they must fry (Fry?)
You know, like electric chair
The way you stare, yeah, I'm there
You committed a crime and I'm the victim

I've got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settlin' down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So, now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul? Honest me, gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chisholm
Was the first, let's rehearse makin' a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000, hard

Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

I don't want to move too fast, but
Can't resist your sexy ass
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Don't want to come on too strong, but
I'll play in you all day long
Just spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

Don't want to make you feel strange, but
Don't let these words be in vain
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)
Nature knows that I want you, but
Not unless you want me too
So spread, spread for me
(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)

// She Lives In My Lap //

[Rosario Dawson:]
What's wrong? What are you afraid of?
The Love Below?

[André 3000:]
She stays alone, never sheds a single tear
She stays in coolest moods, clearly woman of the year
She and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win
She comes back to the cooler side of town
Ah, but she lives in my lap

She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)

Make me want you, make me miss you
Make me wonder where you are, then forget you
Girl, remind me just who we are
We're oh so close, but yet so far

[Rosario Dawson and André 3000:]
Baby, why are you acting like this?
I don't care about any of them, I care about you
Baby, I love you
You've got me open wide (I love you)
Just come inside (baby)
It's yours (it's yours), I'm yours (I'm yours)
For sure (for sure), play, baby, play

[André 3000:]
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)

[André 3000 and Rosario Dawson:]
("I had a woman down...")
("On my lap at all times")
("I had a woman down...")
("On my lap at all...") (The Love Below)
("I had a woman down...")
She lives in my lap
("On my lap at all times")
("Now I'm realizing that I love her")
("On my lap at all times")
You've got me open wide
Oh, she lives in my lap
It's yours, I'm yours
Play, baby, play

Baby, I love you!
Forever my fiancée

Play, baby, play

// Hey Ya //

[André 3000:]
One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!

But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)

Now, I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now, all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

// Roses //

[André 3000:]
Caroline (Caroline), see, Caroline
All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, haha, yeah

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh
Yeah, roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh

Caroline, (Caroline), see
She's the reason for the word 'bitch' (bitch)
I hope she's speedin' on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to a baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror and crash, crash
Crash into a ditch (Just playin')
She needs a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it takes to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, yeah

Lean a little bit closer, see

[Big Boi:]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

[André 3000:]
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like poo-poo-ooh

Better come back down to Mars
Girl, quit chasing cars
What happens when the dough gets low
Bitch, you ain't that fine, no way, no way, no way
