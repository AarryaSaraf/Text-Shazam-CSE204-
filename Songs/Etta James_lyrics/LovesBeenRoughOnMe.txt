Album: LovesBeenRoughOnMe

// The Rock //

When you wake up
In the morning and you wonder
Why no one's beside you where I usually lay
And you think you hear
The sound of a distant thunder
It's just your old rock rolling away

I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock but I'm rolling away

I'm rolling away on a downhill grade
But I'm coming to rest side
A mountain of love some day
'Cause I finally understand
If you're resting on shifting sands
Even a rock goes rolling away

And I was your rock standing strong for you
There was nothing I wouldn't do
No matter the cost I was ready to pay
Oh now you say I'm only holding you down
Like some old rock you've been dragging around
Yes, I'm your rock and I'm rolling away

// I Can Give You Everything //

Silver and gold
They tarnish when they get old
Money and fame
Really donât mean anything

When youâre riding
In your car
When you ainât happy where you are
If you need a change of scenery
Just slide on over next to me

Iâve got love enough to cover the world
For a man that only wants one girl
So if to you love means anything
I can give you everything

Sex appeals
But itâs breaking every heart it steals
So come on
Lets go
âCause if thereâs one thing that I know

Your friends 
They donât care
When you need them they ainât ever there

Looks deceive
âCause theyâll tell you things you cant believe

Iâve got love enough to cover the world
For a man that only wants one girl
So if to you love means anything
I can give you everything

I can give you everything
So come on, lets go 
Come on, lets go
If love to you means anything

I said I I I I I I 
I can give you everything
Come on
Come on
