Album: AllTheWay

// All The Way //

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes

If it's real when somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

// Strung Out //

I will do whatever you say
It's got to be, it's got to be that way, yes it does
Because it's true, oh, oh yeah, it's true
That I'm strung out, strung out on you, on you

Alright, if you say one, just tell me, boy
I'm gonna start walkin' and if you say talk
Tell me I'm gonna open my mouth and start talkin', boy

I'm strung out, well, oh yeah, I'm strung out on you
Oh ha, on you, baby, on you, on you
You, you, you, you, you

Yeah, now listen, I was in such a romance, hey, hey
And I stopped off in Paris, France, yes I did
It was a whole lot of people knew me, oh yeah
But don't you know, don't you know that wouldn't do me, no, no, no, no

And I stopped off in Spain, everything, everything remains the same
I just needed you, needed you, you, you, talkin' about you
I just needed you, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

If you say, walk, darlin', I'll put on my best shoes and start walkin'
Hey, and I dare you to tell me to talk, all day and all night
I'm gonna be talkin', 'cause I'm strung out and well

I'm strung out on you, I'm strung out, strung out, baby, on you
Strung out on you, you, you, you, oh yeah, yeah
My goodness, I got a Jones, baby

Well, well, well, now listen now, now
Oh bay, oh yeah, well, well, now listen

I went to the family doctor, yes I did
And he used everything he had, yes he did
And he said, "Etta, your case is so sad, it's so sad"

You, you, I need you, I need you, you, you, you
Oh baby, I need you, I need you like the bees need the flowers
And like the trees need the sunshine
And I need only the one that I'm strung out, strung out on you
No, it's you, you, you, oh yeah, strung out on you

// Somewhere //

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us somewhere

There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together and time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Some day, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn, time to care

Some day, somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow, some day, somewhere
