// Only Time Will Tell //

I just needed someone, somebody to hold
When the bottle was empty
And the nights grew cold
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
You were my angel of mercy
And helped me to believe
You touched my soul
When I was lonely
You held me up
When I couldn't fly
There's no words could explain
How I feel inside
And this I tell you
In a world full of anger
In times gone strange
You held me close
You held me close to you
Lay my head on your shoulder
I finally let it all out
It felt good for a moment
Not living in a shadow of doubt
But everybody needs a little something
To pull them through
I gave one for the other
And God know that the other was you
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
My angel of mercy
Pulled me through somehow
I just hope you know
I need you now
You're the one
That touched my very soul
The one who held on tight
God knows you never let go
Now only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love is scratched in sand
Or if it's etched in stone
Only time will tell
Only time will tell
If our love will stand
Or walk the road alone
Only time will
Only time will
(Can you bring my hands to yours)
Only time will tell
(Can you teach my soul to fly)
Only time will
Only time will
(Can you save me)
Only time will tell
Angel of mercy
It's time we closed the door
Put out the lights
And burn the fire
Burn the fire inside
Angel of mercy

// I Want To Be Loved By You (But Only By You) //

I want to be loved, I want to be loved
I want to be loved, I need to be loved

I want to be loved with inspiration
I want to be loved starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Oh, hold me tight

I want to be loved, I crave affection
Those kisses of your's I gladly share
I want your eyes to shine in my direction
Oh, make me care

I want a can't of romance
That should be strong and equally as tender
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning
The word surrender, surrender, come on, surrender

I want to be thrilled by only you, dear
I want to be thrilled by your caress
I want to find each dream of mine come true, dear
I want to be loved

I want the can't of romance
That should be strong and equally as tender
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning
Come on, come on, surrender, surrender, surrender, surrender

I want to be thrilled by only you, dear
I want to be thrilled by your caress
I want to find each dream of mine come true, dear
Oh, I want to be loved, oh, I want to be loved
I want to be loved, oh, I want to be loved, I need to be loved

// Prisoner Of Love //

Along from night to night 
You'll find me
To weak to break the chains
That bind me
I need no shackles
To remind me
That I'm just a prisoner of Love
For one command
I stand and wait now
From one who's master
Of my fate now
I can't escape
For it's to late now
That I'm just a prisoner of love

What's so good of my caring
When someone is sharing
These arm's, with me
Although he has another
I can't have another 
For I'm..., I'm not free

He's in my dreams
awake or sleeping, ummm
Up on my knees 
To him I'm creeping, oh yeah,yeah...
My very soul is in his keeping

I'm....just a prisoner....of love

// These Foolish Things //

A cigarette that bares a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you.
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumblin'words That told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things
remind me of you.
You came,
You saw,
You conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March That made my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings But who's to answer
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
First daffodils
And long excited cables

And candle lights

on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening
When the bell has sounded

The Isle de France

With all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange,
How sweet,
To find you still,
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains
At empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside
Dance invitations
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
Gardenia perfume
Lingering on a pillow
Wild strawberries
Only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings,
These foolish things,
Remind me of you
The smile of Garbo
And the scent of roses
The waiters whistling
As the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things
Remind me of you
How strange
How sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smoldering leaves
The wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street
Who walk like dreamers
Oh how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things
Remind me of you.

// Again //

Again
This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine

What's more
This never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly, suddenly be mine

Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear

What matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again

Mine to hold as I'm holding you now
And never, never, never so near
Mine to have when the now
And the here disappear and oh

What matters, what matters, what matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never again, again
Never, never again, again

// Don't Take Your Love From Me //

Tear a star from out of the sky and the sky feels blue
Tear a petal from a rose and the rose weep too
C'mon and take your heart away from mine and mine will surely break
My life is yours to make, so please keep the spark awake

Would you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?
Would you take the ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you
No, don't, don't, no, don't take your love from me

Now tell me, now tell me would you
Would you take the wings from a bird so that they can't fly?
Would you take, would you take the ocean's
The ocean's roar and leave just a sigh?
All this your heart won't let you do, this is what I beg of you
No, don't, don't, don't, don't take your love from me

Don't take your love, don't take your love
Don't take your love, don't take your love from me, child
Yeah, don't take your love, don't take it, don't take it, don't take it
Don't take your love, don't take your love, don't take it from me

// Lover Man (Oh, Where Can He Be?) //

I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I'd long to try something I'd never had
Never had no kissing, ooh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me but no one's here to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
And I'll go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
And whisper sweet, little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing baby
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said that the thrill of romance
Could be like a heavenly dream
And I'll go to bed with the prayer
That you'll make love, love to me strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing, oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

// Don't Blame Me //

Don't, don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell, how can I help it?
Don't blame me

Can't you see when you do the things you do?
If I can't conceal the thrill that I feel
Don't blame me

I can't help it if that doggoned moon up above
Makes, makes me need something like you to love

Blame your kiss, strange as a kiss could be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me

// Tell It Like It Is //

If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby, my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if want me to love you
Then, baby, I will, girl, you know I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide
But I-I-I-I-I know deep down inside of me
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride

Life is too short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby, go on and live

Tell it like it is
I'm nothin' to play with, go and find yourself a toy
But I-I-I-I-I
Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy

[FADE]
Mm mm, tell it like it is
