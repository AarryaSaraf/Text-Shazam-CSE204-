// A Sunday Kind Of Love //

I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
And I'd like to know
It's more than love at first sight
And I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah, yeah

I want a, a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody
Someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road
That leads to nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming, oh yeah
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
Oh, I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone
Someone to enfold
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
Love for all my life to have and to hold
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't want a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday
Or Thursday, Friday or Saturday
Oh nothing but Sunday, oh yeah
I want a Sunday Sunday
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday kind of love

// At Last //

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah
At last

The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah yeah
You smiled, you smiled
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine...

At Last

// All I Could Do Was Cry //

I heard church bells ringing
I heard a choir singing
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger he placed a ring

Oh, I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise "Till death do us part"
Each word was a pain in my heart

All I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I loved
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)

Yeah and now the wedding's over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them life has just begun
But mine is at an end

All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I loved (cry, cry, cry)
And all I could do was cry (cry, cry, cry)

// If I Can't Have You //

I don't want nobody
If I can't have you
Oh I can't love nobody
Unless I'm loving you

[Chorus:]
The way you hug me
The way you squeeze me
The way you kiss me
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
If I can't have you

I can't talk to nobody
Unless I'm talking to you
I don't wanna hold nobody
Unless I'm holding you

[Chorus]

I can't be kissing nobody
Unless I'm kissing you
I just don't... I just don't...
I just don't want to be bothered with nobody
Unless I'm bothered with you

// Tell Mama //

You thought you had found a good girl,
One to love you and give you the world
Now you find that you been misused,
Talk to me, I'll do what you choose.

I want you to

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything all right

That girl you had didn't have no sense,
She wasn't worth all the time you spent

She had another man throw you outdoors,
Now the same man is wearing your clothes.

I want you to

Tell Mama, all about it, tell Mama, what you need
Tell Mama, what you want and I'll make everything all right

// I'd Rather Go Blind //

Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, 'Cry, girl'
When I saw you and that girl walkin' out

Whoo, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no

Whoo, so you see, I love you so much
That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't wanna be free, no

Whoo, whoo, I was just, I was just, I was just
Sitting here thinkin' of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

Whoo, and baby, baby, I'd rather, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Whoo, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind boy
[Fade out:] Baby, baby, baby...

// All The Way Down //

Out on the street
The summer heat
Boys playing games
Changing their names
Pulling tricks
Getting their kicks
All the way down
Let it ride

Meetin the stars
In funky bars
Shiny new cars
And back door lies
Trying to hike
Or any other type of ride
All the way down
Let it ride

Trying everythank now
Gotta check it out
Trying everythang now
Gotta check it out
Hey girl!
You want a blow?
Why not?
I got nowhere to go.

Benny the Albino
Says don't be a whino
Try these here flakes
They got what it takes
To make you a star
All the way down
And change who you are
Let it ride

Tell me were you satisfied?
Did you mix it?
Did you like it?
Oooh! Tell me was it good to you.
I wanna know did you make enough money?
Did you make enough money to do down in style?
Or did you find yourself just dying, dying, dying
After a while?

Got to get off!
Got to get off!
I got to go, got to, got to, got to get off!
Please help me, help me!
To git off now, now!
Before I freeze, and before I can come up off my knees
And lose my key to freedom.
And I go, All the way down, All the way down.

// Fool That I Am //

Fool that I am,
For falling in love with you.
And a, fool that I am,
For thinking you loved me, too.

You took my heart,
Then played the part of little coquette.
And, all my dreams just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette.

Fool that I am,
For hoping you'd understand.
And thinking you
Would listen, too,
And, oh, the things I had planned.

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling,
This is goodbye.
But I still care, but I still care,
And oh, fool that I am.
Oh, but I still care,
Fool that I am.

// Something's Got A Hold On Me //

Oh oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah (Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no (Yeah)
And I just gotta tell you right now that I
I believe, I really do believe that

Something's got a hold on me, yeah (oh, it must be love)
Oohoh, something's got a hold on me right now, child (oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk

[Chorus]
I said, oh, oh, oh, oh
heyyyy baby
Oh, it must be love (you know it must be love)

Let me tell you know
Something's got a hold on me, yeah (oh, it must be love)
Oohoh, something's got a hold on me right now, child (oh, it must be love)

Let me tell you now
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I believe I'd die if I only could
I sure feel strange, but it sure feels good

[Chorus]

Let me tell you know
My heart feels heavy, my feet feel light
I shake all over, but I feel alright
I never felt like this before
Something's got a hold on me that won't let go
I never thought it could happen to me 
Got me heavy without the misery
I never thought it could be this way
Love's sure gonna put a hurting on me 

[Chorus]

Yeah, he walks like love (you know he walks like love)
He talks like love (you know he talks like love)
Makes me feel alright (makes me feel alright)
In the middle of the night (in the middle of the night)

La na la la (la la la la)
La na la la (la la la la)

// Next Door To The Blues //

Sorrow
Is the street that I'm living on
Across Pain Avenue
In a town call Moan
The people I see are sadder than me
A river of tears
Don't you know it flows by my door

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move
Oh Lord
Next door to the Blues

Memory
You can tell it in my talk
My heart hurts
Even when I walk
I cry on
A pillar made of stone
Pity is my name
And that thing called love is to blame

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, oh Lord
Next door to the Blues

Bittersweet
Is the food that I cook
My only joy is in a storybook
The talk I give
Every word brings a tear
Every hello
Just ends with a sad goodbye

And I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
Yes I'm living
(Next door to the Blues)
And after all I've been through
I've had to move, Oh Lord
Next door to the Blues

// Don't Cry Baby //

Don't cry, don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, cuz you know
You know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

And oh, don't cry
Don't cry baby
Don't cry, don't cry
Dry your eyes, and let's be sweethearts again
And oh, cuz you know I didn't mean
To ever treat you so mean
C'mon, c'mon sweetheart
And let's try it over again

// Two Sides (To Every Story) //

There's always two sides to every story
Ahh, he told me
I treated him good
Now you tell me
He was playing me for a fool

But I think you're both
Playing a silly game
Believe me, I know
I did the same

But there are always two sides
To every story, yeah
But two wrongs can't make it right

Oh, and two mistakes will only bring you heartache
And you will end up losing the fight

Oh, saw my lover with another gal
So I jumped and got myself another guy
And when I found out she meant nothing to him
All I could do was cry
(Too late, too late)
(Too late, too late)

Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
There's always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
Two sides to every story
Ahhh, you better, you better beware
And you better have faith if you care

Things aren't always like they seem to be
So take this tip from experienced me

There are always two sides
To every story, yeah
But two wrongs, two wrongs can't make a right

Oh, and two mistakes will only bring you heartache
And you both will end up losing the fight

Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
Oh, there are always two sides
Don't you know there are always two sides
There's always my side
There's always your side
There's always his side
And always my side

// Pushover //

So you told all the boys that you were gonna take me out
Ya even, ya even had the nerve to make a bet, oh yes you did
That I would give in, all my love you would win
But ya haven't, you haven't won it yet

You took me for a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
Oh I'm not a pushover
You thought my love was easy to get

All of the girls think you're fine, they even call ya Romeo
Ya got'em, yeah you got'em runnin' to and fro, oh yes you have
But I don't want a one night thrill, I want a love that's for real
And I can tell by your line, yours is not the lastin' kind

You took me for a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
No I'm not a pushover
You thought that you could change my mind

Your temptin' lips, your wavy hair
Your pretty eyes with that come hither stare
It makes me weak and I start to bend
And then I stop and think again
"No, no, no don't let yourself go"
I hate to spoil your reputation, I want a true love not an invitation
And I'm hip to every word in your conversation

You took me for a pushover
Oh I'm not a pushover
Oh you thought I was a pushover
Oh you can't push me over
Nobody's gonna push me over
Oh you're not man enough to push me over
Yeah everybody thought you was gonna push me over

// Stop The Wedding //

Wait, wait! Stop the wedding!
You're just marrying her for spite
If she knew the inside story
She'd tell you what you're doing just ain't right

I know you don't wanna hurt me
So stop this madness before it starts
Revenge will only cause you regret
So don't do it, don't do it
Don't break two hearts (Don't break two hearts)

'Cause you belong to me, oh darlin'
And I belong to you and deep down inside me now
I know you feel that way to
So baby, don't do it (don't do it)
Don't do it (don't do it) Don't do it (don't do it)
Oh, don't you break two hearts
(Oh don't break two hearts)

No, no, no, baby don't do it (don't you do it)
Don't do it (don't you do it)
Stop the wedding (don't you do it)
Oh, Don't you break, don't you break two hearts
(oh don't break two hearts)

You were even talking about your man to his best friend
You have no business doing that
Then you promised him if he come back
He's never miss you, see

It was a case of

Losers, weepers, finders, keepers

I been in love with your man for a long, long time
Yes I have, you didn't know that did you?
I been trying to think of a way to make him mine
Now listen, I will still be your best friend and do all, do all I can

Because it was a case of

Losers, weepers, finders, keepers
