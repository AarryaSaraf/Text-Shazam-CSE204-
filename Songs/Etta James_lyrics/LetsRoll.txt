// Somebody To Love //

You need a job, so you can make some money
You need a nice warm place to stay
A sense of humor 'cause life ain't funny
A big stick keeps the wolves away

You need a car with good tyres on it
The right place to eat barbecue
A heavy duty set of jumper cables
No holes in your walkin' shoes

The main thing you're gonna find, you need
A fertile place to plant your seed

Gotta find somebody to love you
Someone to be there for you night and day
Somebody to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
You got to give it away

I got to recommend some Life Insurance
Be prepared to dial 911
Pay close attention to your high blood pressure
Stay away from the man with the gun

You need a reason to get up in the mornin'
Make sure the clock got snooze control
Be sure you got a place to run for cover
'Cause overnight things can get real cold

You're gonna find that sooner or later
You need a common denominator

You gotta find somebody to love
Someone to be there night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Oh, give it away

The main thing you're gonna go, what you need
A fertile place where the plant you seed

You got to find somebody to love
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away

You gotta find somebody to love
Be there for you night and day
Someone to share, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away

Gotta find somebody, you gotta find somebody
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away

You gotta find somebody to love
Someone to be there for you night and day
Someone to share with, be a part of you
Love ain't no good till you give it away

Love ain't no good till you give it away
Love ain't no good till you give it away
Gotta give it away, gotta give it away

// The Blues Is My Business //

I got a heart full of trouble, a house full of sin
And things are bad as they ever been
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should

I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

If I had a dollar for every broken heart
I'd be drinkin' fine wine and eatin' caviar
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should

I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

Well business, the business is good
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, the blues is my business
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

It's a world full of trouble and a world full of pain
I'll take the problem, but I won't take no blame
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should

I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, the blues is my business

I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

The blues is my business, the blues is my business
The blues is my business, the blues is my business
And business is good
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business
The blues is my business and business is good

// Leap Of Faith //

After my baby quit me
I wouldn't even go outside
When my friends tried to fix me up
I crawl under my bed and hide

I knew I was never gonna change my look
Till I got my courage up to try
And when I went ahead and spread my wings
I found out that I could fly

Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith
(Leap of faith)
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
(Leap of faith)

I had no way of knowing
What would come from our first kiss
It scares me now to think about
The good love that I might have missed

I was just tryin' to find some help
Tryin' to see myself as a survivor
I had to rise up from the ashes of love
And jump back into the fire

Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah
(Leap of faith)
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
(Leap of faith)

Sometimes, you gotto believe
Before you see the proof
You can wait a lifetime
For one moment of truth

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
Yeah, oh yeah

You gotto believe
Before you see the proof
You can wait a lifetime
For one moment of truth

Oh yeah, sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
Sometimes, all it takes
(Leap of faith)
Sometimes, all it takes
(Leap of faith)

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does
(Leap of faith)
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
(Leap of faith)

Oh, sometimes, all it takes
(Leap of faith)
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah
(Leap of faith)

Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith

// Strongest Weakness //

I smoked my last cigarette
Threw that nasty habit away
Laid down my last dollar on my last bet
Didn't ever win anyway

Gave up the wine and whiskey
'Cause everybody said I should
But I'm givin' up on quittin' you, baby
'Cause it feels so damn good

You are my strongest weakness
Can't get enough, can't give you up
You are my deepest secret
I know it's wrong but I can't go on

And I try, try, try
I ask myself why, why, why?
My strongest weakness

You been runnin' around for a long time now
I know all the games you play
Sooner or later you will put me down
Gonna have to face it someday

But baby, every time you hold me
And I get another taste of your kiss
I feel a power comin' over me
That my body just can't miss

You are my strongest weakness
Can't get enough, can't give you up
You are my deepest secret
I know it's wrong but I can't go on

I try, try, try
I ask myself why, why, why?
My strongest weakness

Why can't you just say no?
(Strongest weakness)
I said why can't I let you go?
(Strongest weakness)

Why, why do I keep, keep breakin' down?
(Strongest weakness)
I said why can't I turn around?
(Strongest weakness)

You know I try, try, try
I ask myself why, why, why?
I give in to you, baby
You are my strongest weakness

(Strongest weakness)
Can't get enough, can't give you up
(Deepest secret)
Deepest secret

(Strongest weakness)
Strongest weakness
(Deepest secret)
You are, you are
(Strongest weakness)

// Wayward Saints Of Memphis //

I have seen the wayward saints of Memphis
The wasted angels down on Stratford Road
You might believe Iâve taken leave of my senses
But I can feel their presence in my soul

I have seen the wayward saints of Memphis
Down on Beale, when the neons go to sleep
With a guitar case layinâ open on the sidewalk
People passing, droppinâ pennies at their feet

They came out of the fields of Mississippi
Like refugees up Highway 61
Looking for salvation in the city
They recognize each and every one

I can feel the restless ghosts of Memphis
I hear the cries and the shufflinâ of their feet
Like a heart that just wonât stop, keeps on beating
A thousand echoes whisper down the street

I have seen the wayward saints of Memphis
The wasted angels down on Stratford Road
You might believe Iâve taken leave of my senses
But I can feel their presence in my soul

I have seen the wayward saints of Memphis
Down on Beale, when the neons go to sleep
With a guitar case layinâ open on the sidewalk
People passing, droppinâ pennies at their feet

// Lie No Better //

Here you come draggin' in
Three a.m. again
Grinnin' that silly grin
Smellin' just like sin

Holdin' up that alibi that's tissue paper thin
Diggin' down deeper and deeper
In that hole you're already in

If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth

I know you been foolin' around
With some fool from way 'cross town
You're tearin' our good thing down
Makin' me out your clown
Lookin' for excuses that you know can't be found

If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth

And you could be more discreet
With your love letters
And honey, I smell some other man
All over your Cashmere sweater

If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that

If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better
If you can't lie no better than that
You might as well tell the truth

// Trust Yourself //

I see my sister down on the street
She got blisters burning through the sole of her feet
Working for a man
Who treats her like a piece of meat

I see my brother just looking for a hit
Down in the gutter, swearing to God he gonna quit
Working for a man
Who doesn't care if he dies or lives

If you do what you're told
You better watch who you tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Hey, trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself

I see my children at the fork of the road
It makes me wonder which way they goin'
Live by mama's word
Or die with a gun in their hand, oh no no no

If you do what you're told
You better watch who does the tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself

Sisters... Brothers...
Children... Mother...
People... People...

Well, well now I say
Sisters, brothers, children,
Hold on, oh mothers

If you do what you're told
You better watch who does the tellin'
Before you believe you gotta see what they're sellin'
Don't give up your soul to nobody else
If you wanna be free you gotta trust yourself

Trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself (trust yourself)
I said trust yourself (trust yourself)
Trust yourself
...

// A Change Is Gonna Do Me Good //

Drained of emotion
Tears run dry
I would give anything just to feel alright
Down on my knees praying' for help
But sometimes you just gotta help yourself

I tried so hard to be someone you would love
Seems I would never try hard hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta give you up
I'm going back to who I was
And I do believe that a change is gonna do me good

Lets take this moment
To say goodbye
Look at each other
Right straight in the eye
Don't look back baby
Cause I'll be gone
I've got my own life to carry on

I tried so hard to be someone you'd love
Seems I would never try hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta give you up
I'm going back to who I was
And I do believe that
Change is gonna do me good

I tried so hard to be someone you'd love
Seems I would never try hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta to give you up
I'm going back to who I was ahhh
I do believe
Change is gonna do me good

I do believe
Change, change is gonna do me good
Change change change is gonna do me good

// Old Weakness //

Two in the mornin' too hot to sleep
Tossin' and turnin' and twistin' the sheets
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong

Window wide open in the back bedroom
Sweet smell of honeysuckle in full bloom
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong

Feel like I'm running on real low willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn 'til the midnight hour
I keep fightin' to let you go
But your love is beyond my control

Took down that picture of you and me
But every time I look up where it used to be
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong

Still got your number next to the phone
Just when I believe I can leave it alone
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong

Feel like I'm running on real low willpower
Can't get you out of this heart of mine
From the break of dawn til the midnight hour
I keep fightin' to let you go
But your love is beyond my control
I feel an old weakness comin' on strong

I feel an old weakness, yeah
I feel an old weakness
I feel an old weakness comin' on, comin' on strong, yeah

// Stacked Deck //

Well, if you gonna play cards, baby
Well, don't you know you've got to deal some time
Well, if you gonna play cards, baby
Well, don't you know you've got to deal some time
Well listen to me, baby
And I'm gonna tell you how I deal mine

The Ace is for the first time that I met you
Duce that's the second time that there was no one but just us two
Trey that's the third party, and darlin' you know his name
Four that's the fourth time that you tried to play that same old game
Five is for five years that you used me for a clown
Six that's the sixth time that you tried to put me down
Well I'm holding out for the Seven, for the seven days in the week
Well, eight that's the eighth hour, when you went out with your sheik
Nine is for the nine years that I worked hard every day
Ten that's the tenth of the month, when you came every Friday to collect my pay
Well the Jack he's your lover, and you're using me for a goat
Queen that's you pretty mama and you're trying to cut my throat
Whoa, but the King that's me, Lord and I'm about to wear my crown
So be careful pretty baby, you ain't dead when the deal goes down

If you gonna play cards, baby
Don't you know you've got to deal some time
So listen to me Baby, that you ain't dead when the deal goes down

// On The 7th Day //

I'm gonna tell you, so you'll understand
About how it all got started, how it all began
God made the heavens, God made the earth
Made a man and a woman out of blood, sweat and dirt
And he looked around the neighbourhood
And he said to himself: This is good

God made the rivers, and the mountains with his hands
God made the wind to blow the shifting sands
He put the fishes in the deep blue sea
Filled up the garden with flowers and the trees
And he looked around the neighbourhood
And he said to himself: This is Good

But the devil, he was jealous
Took the apple in his hand
The devil tempted woman, and woman tempted man
God he mourned, and the tears rolled down his face
It broke his heart to see his children fall from grace
And on the 7th day, they say God rested, but you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
God made the blues

The Blues has been around ever since that day
Everybody gets the blues, everybody got to pay
For the wicked things we do, and what we put each other trough
And on the 7th day, they say God rested, but you know that ain't the truth
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
Cause on the 7th day, God made the blues
God made the blues

// Please, No More //

We start a fight, who knows what for
Who knows who's winning, or who's keeping score
You say it's all right, as you slam the door
All I can say is
"Please no more, please no more."

I've had enough after how I swore
I'd never give you up
Loving you was easy, but one thing's for sure
It ain't me, it ain't me
You're trying to please no more

Passions will burn, burn endlessly
All that's left behind are these broken dreams
While I still got some pieces laid out on the floor
I'm asking you baby
"Please no more, please no more."

I've had enough, after how I swore
I'd never give you up
Loving you was easy, but one thing's for sure
It ain't me, it ain't me
You're trying to please no more
