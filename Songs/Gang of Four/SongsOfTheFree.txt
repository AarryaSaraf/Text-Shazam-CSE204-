// Call Me Up //

Call me up, If I'm home
Don't say too much, I might be upset
Let us agree to differ
We're consumed by competition

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

Call me up, if I'm alone
I don't like to spend too much time on my own
I need to have diversion
Consume me with a new passion

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

We are all in competition
Better move fast gobble up your dinner
Take a tip - get hip!
It's not so bad in the promised land
It's not so bad in the promised land
It's not so bad in the promised land
How do I fill my days?
A force called "Hard Cash" moves my feet

We are all in competition
It's the one thing that is simple
We are all in competition
It's not so bad in the promised land

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

Children of the pleasure culture
Who must be grateful for what we've got
Happy smiles in sunny climes
So don't upset the ice-cream cart

Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)
Having fun is my reason for living
(Give me a break)

// I Love A Man In A Uniform //

Time with my girl I spent it well
I had to be strong for my woman
(You must be joking, oh man you must be joking)
She needed to be protected

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my self-respect
So I got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform

To have ambitions was my ambition
But I had nothing to show for my dreams
Time with my girl I spent it well
(You must be joking, oh man you must be joking)

The good life was so elusive
Handouts, they got me down
I had to regain my confidence
So I got into camouflage

The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform

I need an order
(Shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(Shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(Shoot, shoot)
I need an order
(Shoot, shoot)

To have ambition
Was my ambition
Time with my girl I spent it well
(You must be joking, oh man you must be joking)

The girls they love to see you shoot
The girls they love to see you shoot

I love a man in a uniform
I love a man in a uniform
(They love to see you shoot)
I love a man in a uniform

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(They love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(They love a... they love a... they love a...)
(They love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(Bang bang you're dead)
I love a man in a uniform
(They love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(They love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
I love a man in a uniform
(They love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(They love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(Bang bang you're dead)
I love a man in a uniform
(They love a... they love a... they love a... bang bang)
(They love to see you shoot)

The girls they love to see you shoot
(Bang bang you're dead)
(They love a... they love a... they love a...)
(I love a man in a uniform)

// We Live As We Dream, Alone //

Everybody is in too many pieces
No-man's-land surrounds our desires
To crack the shell we mix with others
Some lie in the arms of lovers

The city is the place to be
With no money you go crazy
I need an occupation!
You have to pay for satisfaction

We live as we dream, alone
To crack the shell we mix with the others
Some flirt with fascism
Some lie in the arms of lovers

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone

Everybody is in too many pieces
No-man's-land surrounds me!
With no money we'll all go crazy
(We apologize)

Man and woman need to work
It helps us define ourselves
We were not born in isolation
But sometimes it seems that way

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone

We live as we dream, alone
The space between our work and its product
Some fall into fatalism
As if it started this way

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone

We live as we dream, alone
(We live as we dream, alone)
We live as we dream, alone
(We were not born in isolation)
We live as we dream, alone
(But sometimes it seems that way)

(The space between our work and its product)

We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
(As if it always must be this way)
We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
We live as we dream, alone
(With no money we'll all go crazy)

// It Is Not Enough //

It is not enough
Here we go again
I'd like to see something new
It's all so familiar

I wanted to be a good wife
I wonder if I've lived before this life
Or seen it on television
I can't stand the repetition

It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past
(I will be good to you, if you love me true)
(I will be good to you, if you love me true)
Passion, it burns me up
It isn't how I thought it would be
I have to wait for the right moment
It always depends on him

It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past

Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?
Have I lived before this life?

It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past

It is not enough
It is just a habit
Nostalgia, it's no good
Our future was in the past

It is not enough
It is just a habit
It is just a habit

// Life! It's A Shame //

Don't stop out too late at night
Stop! It's a caution

Don't cross the red light
Stop! It's a caution

To act for the good for congressman is money
A balance of power will ensure our safety

(Making money is making sense)
Life!
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

Don't stop out too late at night
Stop! It's a caution

Don't cross the red light
Stop! It's a caution

To act for the good for congressman is money
The right to get rich is in the constitution
Talk of corruption is to preach insurrection
Elected to power men suspend self-interest

You and I, we are satellites, it's a shame
You and I, we are satellites, it's a shame

Life!
(Making money is making sense)
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

(Making money is making sense)
Life!
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

To act for the good is to defend our homeland
A balance of power will ensure our safety
To step out of line is to risk disaster
To walk in the rain is to risk pneumonia
A balance of power will ensure our safety

You and I, we are satellites
(Making money is making sense)
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

You and I, we are satellites
(Making money is making sense)
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

Life!
(Making money is making sense)
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

Life!
(Making money is making sense)
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

// I Will Be A Good Boy //

Take me, dance with me
I want to be
Everything a man should be

Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?

No longer on my own
Secure, I smile
Now I am a man
I understand
And I am complete

Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?

Take me, dance with me
Dance
To the tension of a world on the wane
I shuffle around on wooden boards
Now no longer afraid

I will be a good boy, I said
I will be a good boy

// The History Of The World //

When I was in my mother's womb
Social structure seemed a simple thing
After birth I cursed my luck
Then went down to breakfast

What I know fills me up
It is an everlasting cup
What I believe will never change
My consolation for the night

Mother had for me an egg
I understood the relations of production
She always provided for me
That's where I lost my naivet?BR>
Stability is in my mind
I associate with my kind
Charity, it fills my heart
To help the poor in Africa

Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world
Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world
Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world

Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world
Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world
Good, yes, you've done well
Here is a small prize
The history of the world

// Muscle For Brains //

Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myself
They got muscle for brains

For reasons that are not mysterious
The weak are sent to the wall
They have reservations in heaven
Down here they're not so fashionable

Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from my sin
They got muscle for brains

For reasons that are not mysterious
Morality's used as a tool
The poor are told to be contented
But in this life they've no choice at all

Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myself
They got muscle for brains

For reasons that are not mysterious
The weak are sent to the wall
They have reservations in heaven
Down here they're not so fashionable

Don't help me I can save myself
If I'm incomplete don't fill the gaps
Save me from the people who would save me from myelf
They got muscle for brains

Save me from the people who would save me from my sin
They got muscle for brains

// Of The Instant //

Who owns what you do?
Who owns what you use?
This land is your land
This land is my land

Right now to touch flesh is real
Let us think only of the instant
There was something that I can't remember
Did you say "I've had enough"?

We are in a happy state
It all comes to those who wait
While others plot the fate of nations
We spent the afternoons in an embrace

Somehow, you can't block it out
The bitter taste of interference
We still try to construct the difference
The space between a word and its sense

We, it seems, can own ourselves
In imagination

Then you say, we make our own world
Not everyone takes what they are given
If we believe what we are saying
We have the chance to include ourselves out

Who owns what you do?
Who owns what you use?

Then you say, we make our own world
Not everyone takes what they are given
There was something that I can't remember
Did you say "I've had enough"?

There was something that I can't remember
We have the chance to include ourselves out
