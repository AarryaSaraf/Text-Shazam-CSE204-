// 10:36 //

You don't need me
As much as I need you
As much as I need you
Take it or leave it
'Cause you know that's the truth
'Cause you know that's the truth

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I didn't mean that, that thing I said last night, it was)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I don't know what happened)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I have this thing where I, I can't really be by myself)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (But look)

Called you for the last time
I need to be with you
I need to be with you
Saw you in a dream last night
You looked like a ghost
You looked like a ghost

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
(You don't) I know you thought it was just us
(Need me) I didn't think you'd fall in love
(As much as I need you) You're just a warm body to hold
(As much as I need you) At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah

// Sunny Day //

Know it's been raining, I swear, I'm not lonely
Always complaining that you never see me
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

Don't know why I feel this way
Treating all my friends the same
Haven't had enough to do
But I'm not ignoring you
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

// See You Soon //

I wanted to be everything you see
But I went the wrong direction
I needed some affection
And I'm not sure why but
I will see you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue

It's a walk in the park
You said, "It's not that hard"
I'm feeling kinda dizzy
I don't want this to leave me
And I told you, I'll

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

I had some time away
Didn't want to go insane from this
I wanted you to know
I need time to grow and to exist
I think I needed space
Let you know I'm safe
I swear it's just a little thing

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

// Ripples //

Please don't make me hide
I've been putting up a fight
What's the use of it now?
When I get pulled down
Anyways I've been hiding my expressions
You can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground
I might as well have drowned

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
To tell me that you'll be gone soon

Feels too late right now
I've been holding back
'Cause I'm afraid that I'm too loud
Six feet underground
I feel alone again
Stuck between the friends
I guess I'll figure my way through them
Not sure how I'd do it
But I'm sure now the people will listen
As the water glistens and I see my reflection
So much clearer

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon

// The Perfect Pair //

You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it

We don't talk much
I guess 'cause nothing has changed
I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
I guess we're so used to it

Wish I had noticed from the beginning
I find it hard to work out
Why we have all this now?

If I told you you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

// Broken CD //

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

// Talk //

Call you up on a Tuesday
Say "What's up"
Babe it's too late
Why'd you have to be so complicated
Complicated

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

A crowded place
Waiting for you
Am I lost why can't I find you
A silhouette that's in my head
You don't exist
You're my imagination
You don't exist
You're just a bad decision

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

// Pictures Of Us //

Pictures of us
Buildings and rust

I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

And I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it

// Don't Get The Deal //

Tell me
How do you feel?
I've realised
You just don't get the deal

Tell me
(I wonder if the time we spend) How do you feel?
(I could have been a fireman) I've realised
(I'm thinking that I don't get the deal) You just don't get the deal

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Am I caught in a daze?
The look in your eyes
Is never the same

Am I caught in a daze? (I think it's getting harder to see)
(I know that I've been losing sleep) The look in your eyes
(I don't think it's ever the same) Is never the same

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

I needed some time alone
To see that it hurts
You're looking for something
But I'm here to make it worse

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be
