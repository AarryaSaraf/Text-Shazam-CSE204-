// Are You Sure //

You say you understand
Are you sure, are you sure?
You say you've been to Mars before
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

You think you know my brain
Are you sure, are you sure?
You think you know just what to say
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

So talk to me again
You seem to understand
You claim to say its fine
But you never really know where I am
Why
Why
Why
Why

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

// I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus //

Think I'm starting to change
With the weeks and the days
Got this new blue-haired phase

I think I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Guess I'm tryna get by
'Cause like the weather, I change with time

And I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Now I've changed, I've been feeling comfy
But now I've changed, I've been feeling lonely
'Cause your photos suck, your brand is shit
You're up your butt
You never really ask me how I am, ask me how I am

'Cause I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Nice

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Fuck

// Sun More Often //

Keep your head down low
Cause is it the sound, or is it the way things go?
In your head you're scared
So just sing along to the song in end

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

If you tried you'll see
That the world's not as scary as it seems

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often

// She Plays Bass //

Hey, won't you call me back?
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back
It hurts my brain
This chick who plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

Guess we're both stuck in the same boat
The world doesn't seem to get us though
You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
How I wish we could just date
So you could teach me how to be more like you

Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you

// Space Cadet //

Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our fears, they're all gone

Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sitting tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

So quit being so negative
It's fine don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone
