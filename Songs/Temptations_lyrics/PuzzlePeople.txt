// I Can't Get Next To You //

Hold it, everybody
Hold it, hold it, listen

I can turn the gray sky blue
I can make it rain whenever I want it to
Oh, I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
I can make a ship sail, huh, on dry land

But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
Next to you (I can't get next to you)
I just can't get next you (I can't get next to you, babe)
(I can't get next to you)

I can fly like a bird in the sky
Hey, and I can buy anything that money can buy
Oh, I can turn a river into a raging fire
I can live forever if I so desire

Unimportant are all the things I can do
'Cause I can't get next to you (I can't get next to you, babe)
No matter what I do (I can't get next to you)
Uh-yah

Ooh
Ooh
Chicka boom, chicka boom
Chicka boom, boom, boom

I can turn back the hands of time, you better believe I can
I can make the seasons change just by waving my hand
Oh, I can change anything from old to new
The things I want to do the most, I'm unable to do

Unhappy am I with all the powers I possess
'Cause, girl, you're the key to my happiness
And I, oh I can't get next to you

Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
Girl, it's you that I need
I gotta get (next to you)
Can't you see these tears I'm crying?
I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get (next to you)
I, I, I, I, I can't get, now (next to you)
Girl, you're blowing my mind
'Cause I can't get...

// Hey Jude //

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

// Don't Let The Joneses Get You Down //

[Dennis:] Ow, people gather round me, it's whom it may concern.
I'm not trying to run your life.

[Melvin:] But you're never too old to learn, huh.

[Dennis:] Stop worrying about your neighbors and the fancy things they got.
'Cause if you do you'll find it sure, you're gonna wind up on the spot.

[Eddie:] Don't let the Jones

The people you're trying to keep up with...

[Dennis:] You're lying to yourself but you don't even know it.
You're so busy following the Joneses, you ain't got time to show it.
Keeping up with the Joneses, it'll only makes your life a mess.
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and getting deeper in debt.

[Eddie:] You better leave...
[Group:] The Joneses alone.
[Dennis:] Tell 'em one more time.

[Group:] Harray for the Joneses!
[Dennis:] Instead you worry till your whole head turns gray.
[Group:] Worry 'bout the Joneses.

[Melvin] Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay.
[Group:] So leave Jo-Jo-Joneses alone.
[Dennis:] Listen, your car might be old, but remember it never fails to get you where you want to go.

[Eddie:] Oh, don't let the Jones
[Dennis:] Don't let the Jones
[Melvin:] Don't let the Joneses
[Group:] Get you down, oh down.

[Eddie:] Hear me now, now.

Don't let the Joneses get you down.
[Paul:] Now listen, if you see something you want and you know you can't afford it,
The very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it.
[Dennis:] The Joneses have been a downfall for many persons, you see.
So people, take my advice and let the Joneses be. Ow.

[Eddie:] Don't let the Jones
[Dennis:] Don't let the Jones

Don't let the Joneses get you down. (Whoo)

Do-do-do-do-do-do...[etc.] Boom-boom-boom-boom...[etc.]

// Message From A Black Man //

[Melvin:] Yes, my skin is black,
But that's no reason to hold me back
[Eddie:] Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
I have wants and desires,
Just like you
So move on the side
'Cause I'm comin' through, oh!

[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
Eddie and Temptations: No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now, oooh...

[Melvin:] Yes, your skin is white...
Does that make you right?
[Eddie:] Why don't you think about it,
Think about it, think about it, think about it,
Think about it...
This is a message
A message to y'all,
Together we stand,
Divided we fall, oh!

[Dennis:] Black is a color
Just like white,
Tell me how can a color determine whether
You're wrong or right,
We all have our faults...
Yes we do

[Eddie:] So look in your mirror
[Temptations:] Look in the mirror
[Eddie:] What do you see?
[Temptations:] What do you see?
[Eddie:] Two eyes,
[Temptations:] Two eyes,
[Eddie:] A nose, and a mouth just like me, oh!

[Eddie:] Your eyes are open
But you refuse to see,
The laws of society
Were made for both you and me,
Because of my color,
I struggle to be free
Sticks and stones,
May break my bones
But in the end,
You're gonna' see my friend, oh!

[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
[chorus repeated several times through music, or "the bridge"]

[after a few minutes, above chorus is repeated as song nears end, and then...]

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
[Dennis:] I'm black and I'm proud!
[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[Temptations:] Say it loud!
[Dennis:] I'm black and I'm proud!
[Temptations:] No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now

[fade to end]
