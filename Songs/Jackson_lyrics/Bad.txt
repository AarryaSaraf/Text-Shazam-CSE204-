Album: Bad

// Bad //

Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shamone, shamone
Lay it on me
All right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad

The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again who's bad

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again...)

You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Just to tell you
(Just to tell you once again)

You know I'm smooth, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, baby
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it, come on
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again)

You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
(Bad, bad, really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
(And the whole world has to answer right now)
Just to tell you once again who's bad?

// Speed Demon //

Cho! Cho!
Cho! Oh!
Cho! Cho!
Cho!

I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?, I feel some heat is on my back

(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon) Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon, he say) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho!

Ain't nothing gonna stop me, ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway, I gotta really burn this road

(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon) Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon, he say) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

Cho!

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands, the life you save could be your own
You're preaching about my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow
Go! Go!
Go! Ow!

Cho! Oh!
Cho! Cho!
Cho!

(Speed demon) Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon) Got fire in my pocket, I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon) Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon) Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
(Speed demon) Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right (Ooh!)

Uh! Ah!
C'mon! Hoo!
Get your ticket right, ah
Pull over, boy

// Man In The Mirror //

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
(Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind
You see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways
('Cause you better change!)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart

You can't close your your mind
(Then you close your mind!)

That man, that man, that man, that man
With the man in the mirror
(Man in the mirror, oh yeah!)
That man, that man, that man
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Better change!)
You know that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)

Oh, no, oh, no

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Shamone
Change

Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it yourself
(Yeah! Hoo! Make that change!)
I gotta make that change today, hoo
(Man in the mirror)
You got to
You got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo
(Yeah! Make that change!)
You know
I gotta get that man, that man
(Man in the mirror)
You've got to
You've got to move
Shamone, shamone
You got to stand up! Stand up! Stand up!
(Yeah. Make that change)
Stand up and lift yourself now
(Man in the mirror)

Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow!

(Yeah. Make that change)
Gonna make that change
Shamone
(Man in the mirror)

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know

Change
Make that change

// I Just Can't Stop Loving You //

I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God, I need you
I love you so much

[Michael:]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer

[Siedah:]
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart, at your call
I hear harps and angels sing
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

[Michael (Siedah):]
I just can't hold on, (I feel we belong)
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you

[Both (Siedah):]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
('Cause I just can't stop loving you)

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find a love so true
(When morning awakes me, will you come and take me? I'll wait for you)
You know how I feel, I won't stop until I hear your voice saying, "I do" ("I do")
(This thing can't go wrong), this feeling's so strong
(Well, my life ain't worth living), {if I can't be with you}

{I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you}
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
{And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do}
(Uh-huh)
I just can't stop loving you

(We can change all the world tomorrow)
We can sing songs of yesterday
(I can say "Hey. Farewell" to sorrow)
This is my life and I {want to see you for always}

[Michael & Siedah:]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh, oh) (Oh, whoa-whoa!)

// Dirty Diana //

Oh, no, oh, no, no

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?

I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's OK
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."

She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back."
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying, "That's OK
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana! Diana! Dirty Diana!
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!

She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said, "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key,"
She said, "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Ah, don't you touch me)
C'mon! Aaow! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)

// Leave Me Alone //

Aaow!
Hoo-hoo!

I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care, anyway
Time after time, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around (Just stop doggin' me)
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!

There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain't lovin' you
Don't you get in my way

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
Aaow!

Da-da-da-da

Ah, ah

('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know, girl
(There's the choice that we make) (Stop it, baby)
(And this choice you will take) (Stop it, baby)
Who's laughin', baby?

So just leave me alone, girl (Hee!) (Leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me
Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone)

Leave me alone, girl (Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone)
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around
Hee-hee!
