// Don't Let It Get You Down //

Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
A winner stumbles too
But get up and never stop, no
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down, ah no

Don't let it get you down
When the cards are wrong
Pick up, don't let them walk away
Before you lose your heart
(Don't regret, girl)
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down
(Ah, no)
Ah, no

Look at me
Don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't be mean
Let me please be the one that can straighten it out, girl
(Don't let it get you down, don't let it)
(Don't let it get you down, don't let it)
Ain't it a double shame, not to play no friendly game
Don't let it get you down (ah no, don't let it)

I can be your sunshine, make you happy
Ain't no cloudy sky hangin' over me, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down
You can start again
Now yesterday is gone
Let tomorrow be your friend
(Don't regret, girl)
Hey, don't regret girl
My luck is still ahead
Don't let it get you down
(Ah, no)
Ah no

Look at me
Don't it seem like I know what I'm talkin' about
Don't be mean
Let me please be the one that can straighten it out, girl
I can straighten it out girl, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Straighten it out girl, come on
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it, let it, let it
(Don't let it get you down)
No don't let it
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it, let it, let it
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it, let it, let it
Don't let it get you down, come on
(Don't let it get you down)
Don't let it get you down, yeah
(Don't let it get you down)
Yeah, huh, yeah, come on baby

(Don't let it get you down)
Yeah, huh, yeah, come on baby
Don't let it get you down
Come on sugar, yeah

// You've Really Got A Hold On Me //

I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh, you treat me badly
I love you madly

You really got a hold on me, come on
You really got a hold on me, yeah
I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me

I love you and all I want you to do is just hold me

I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh, I want to split now
'Cause I can't quit now

You really got a hold on me, come on

// Melodie //

I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going nowhere

When I saw my sweet Melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of the love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you've told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

// Touch The One You Love //

If I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For every time I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you

You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you

I would get embarrassed
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch

// Girl You're So Together //

Girl, you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

There's no tree
That bears fruits as sweet as you, no
Apples, peaches
And cherries just won't do, ooh baby
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you, babe
(Choose you, babe)

Girl your smile, ooh
Is like the month of May, yeah
When you're near me
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah

Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, you're an eye-eye-popper
A real life traffic stopper
A knockout queen
Oh, what I mean is

Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you, baby
(Girl, you're so together) Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way)
Oh, girl, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)
Oh, girl, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)
Yeah, yeah, you're so together
(Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Girl, you're so together
And together we can make it all the way)

// Farewell My Summer Love //

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

Ooh, farewell, farewell
Ooh, farewell, farewell
If you remember my name (Drop a line)
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah, oh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, farewell yeah, yeah, yeah
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell

// Call On Me //

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere

Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me

Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me

// Here I Am (Come And Take Me) //

I can't believe that it's real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
(A burning deep inside)
A love that I cannot hide

I know it's you honey baby, yeah
(I know it's you honey baby)
That makes the world go 'round
And it's keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, baby
Oh, show me, here I am, baby

Oh, it always ends up this way
(This way, this way, this way)
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
(From love that I can't hide)
You broke my heart into half

I know it's you and me baby, yeah
(I know it's you and me, baby)
That makes the world go 'round
Keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, oh, come and take me

Ooh, come and take me, oh
Ooh
Here I am, baby, baby, come and take me, ooh-hoo
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby
Here I am, baby, come and take me

// To Make My Father Proud //

To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style
If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

War without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared and unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile
