Ooh-ooh!
I'll never forget no way: they turned their back on Paul Bogle
Hey-ey!
So don't you forget (no way) your youth
Who you are and where you stand in the struggle

They got so very, so very, so very, so very, so very, so very, so very
So-so very, they saying everything
They say so much today
They got so much things to say, so much things to say

I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
'Cause I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, true they found me guilty
But through - through Jah proved my innocency

Oh, when the rain fall, fall, fall now
It don't fall on one man's housetop. Remember that:
When the rain fall
It don't fall on one man's housetop

They singin': so very much, so very much, oh so very much
So, so very
They got so much things to say right now
Yeah, they got so much things to say

Hey, but I'n'I - I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood
But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while, so while, so while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, hey through Jah to prove my innocency
I told you wicked think they found me guilty

They got la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

They got the rumor without humor
They don't know what they're doin', yeah

// Guiltiness //

Guiltiness (talking about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
And they live their lives (they live their lives)
On false pretence every day
Each and every day

These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish
(These are the big fish)
A just the small fish
I tell you again: they would do anything
To materialize their every wish

Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow

Guiltiness
(Talk about guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience
These are the big fish
(These are the big fish)
Who always try to eat down the small fish
A just the small fish

I tell you what: they would do anything(anything)
To materialize their every wish

Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sad tomorrow
Woe to the downpressors
They will eat the bread of sorrow

Guiltiness
They'll eat the bread of sorrow every day

// Jammin' //

[MC Lyte:]
This struggle continues
This struggle continues

We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley:]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is gonna last

No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can't be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah, Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold

Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

The mighty will try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord persist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte:]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over 'til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don't really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

J-A double M-I-N
We be jamming from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jamming in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I 'naw be no rap star
Exodus when I bust
See the struggle I must
Realize it ain't just
But what's next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jamming (yes)

[Bob Marley:]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte:]
We be jamming
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley:]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte:]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley:]
Jam's about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can't resist
So jam by my side
We're jamming (we're jamming)
And we're jamming in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We're jamming (we're jamming)
We're jamming right straight God (from God)
Holy mount Zion, we're jamming right straight from God
Holy mount Zion, we're jamming right straight from God
Holy mount Zion, we're jamming right straight from God
Holy mount Zion, we're jamming right straight from God
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

We jamming (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jamming too

// Waiting In Vain //

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love

From the very first time I blessed my eyes on you, girl
My heart says follow through
But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line
But the waitin' feel is fine
So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
'Cause I know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gonna come, see

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
'Cause if summer is here
I'm still waiting there
Winter is here
And I'm still waiting there

Like I said:
It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door
And I still can knock some more
Cuckoo girl, cuckoo girl, is it feasible?
I wanna know now, for I to knock some more
Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief
But your love is my relief
Tears in my eyes burn - tears in my eyes burn
While I'm waiting - while I'm waiting for my turn
See!

I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in vain for your love, oh!

Wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain)

I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain)
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna - I don't wanna
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain)
It's me love that you're running from
It's your love that I'm waiting on (I don't wanna - I don't wanna
I don't wanna - I don't wanna - I don't wanna wait in vain)
It's me love that you're running from

// Turn Your Lights Down Low //

Turn your lights down low
And pull your window curtains
Oh, let Jah moon come shining in
Into our life again
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time

But it seems I was never on time
Still I gotta get through to you girl
On time, on time (word)
I want to give you some love
I want to give you some good, good loving
(Uh, uh, right, uh)
Oh I, oh I, oh I
Yeah I want to give you some good, good loving (uh)

Never ever try to resist, oh no

Into our lives again

Ooh I love you

// Three Little Birds //

"Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

Rise up this morning, smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you-ou-ou"

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright"
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing (Don't worry)
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright!"

'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright (Don't worry)
Singing, "Don't worry about a thing (I won't worry)

Singing, "Don't worry about a thing

// One Love / People Get Ready //

One love! One heart!

Hear the children crying (One love!)
Hear the children crying (One heart!)
Saying, "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright."
Saying, "Let's get together and feel alright." Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love!)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One heart!)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs?

One love! What about the one heart? One heart!
What about theâLet's get together and feel alright
As it was in the beginning (One love!)
So shall it be in the end (One heart!)
Alright!
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
One more thing!

Let's get together to fight this holy Armageddon (One love!)
So when the man comes there will be no, no doom (one song!)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There is no hiding place from the Father of Creation
Singing!

One love! What about the one heart? One heart!
What about theâLet's all get together and feel alright
I'm pleading to mankind! (One love!)
Oh, Lord! (One heart) Wo-ooh
