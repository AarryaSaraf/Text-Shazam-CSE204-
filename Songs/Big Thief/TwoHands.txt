Album: TwoHands

// Rock And Sing //

We served his body
Naked in bed
Quiet and obviously not dead

I and that naked thing swimming in air
Why does that mean anything?
Why do you stare?

Lean on your table
Ask what you want of me
I am unable
Cry with me, cry with me

Within this body
Come home and fuse
Come fuse my home for a refuge
I don't wanna be scared of (I don't wanna be scared of)
Anybody coming in (Anybody coming in)
I don't wanna lock my door anymore

Hand me that cable
Plug into anything
I am unstable
Rock and sing, rock and sing

// Forgotten Eyes //

Forgotten eyes are the ones which we lose
Forgotten hands are the ones which we choose
To let go of, but it is no less a bruise
On the collective arm, keepin' us hangin' on

Forgotten dance is the one left at birth
Forgotten plants in the fossils of earth
And they've long passed, but they are no less the dirt
Of becoming soil, keepin' us dry and warm

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm

Haul away on any street, no sirens to hear
Just trash and soiled needles, clawing the veneer
And no crying, but it is no less a tear
On the common cheek with which we smile

Haul away on any, is it they or is it I?
Is it me who is more hollow as I'm quickly passing by?
And the poison is killing them, but then so am I, as I turn away

The wound has no direction
Everybody needs a home and deserves protection, hmm-mm

Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue is the language of love
Forgotten tongue

// The Toy //

What a slow
Familiar dream
I wake up
Laughing and drowning
From the boy
Crying and calling
'Cause the toy, in my hand
Is real

What a tomb
We're building here
In the sphere
That's where we all die
In the eye
That's where I'm living
The toy, in my hand
Is real

In the room
The warm hands play
On my breast
What is she singing?
This horror, ringing and ringing
'Cause the toy, in my hand
Is real
The toy, in my hand
Is real

Charcoal womb
The jet planes purr
And the cruel, distant is paid for
Children burn
Faceless paper
'Cause the toy, in my hand
Is real
'Cause the toy, in my hand
Is real

// Two Hands //

You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans, tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know

You somehow took me in
Both arms, the marked-up skin
Two hands, places you have been
That I needed

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

Now you call my bluff
All clear, and you get so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

Somehow we exist
In the folds and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching

But I could not take you through
New plans, I'll tell you who
New friends, you can make some too
I know

// Those Girls //

Dropped call mid-fall
Only you can know for now
Ironed demons
Only you can hold them down

Those girls might
Hear me cryin'
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try

Ironed demons
So will you come over now?
'Cause those girls keep tellin' me things
And only you can hold them down

Those girls might
Hear me cryin'
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try

Those girls might
Hear me cry
The one, the only
Jealousy, yeah, yeah, is dyin'
We saw all along
Your arms around me try

// Shoulders //

Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin
And tell me where you been

You brought me in
You brought me in
So, touch my skin
And tell me where you been

You showed me how
To keep myself from burning out

They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who killed my mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me
In my veins

Please wake up
Please wake up
Touch my skin
And tell me where you been

You brought me in
My best friend
So touch my skin
And tell me where you been

You showed me how
To hold my sin
And kiss the
Bad ways I have been

They found you in the morning
The blood was on your shoulders
They found you at the corner
Your head was doubled over
And the blood of the man
Who's killing our mother with his hands
Is in me, it's in me
In my veins

It's in me
It's in me
In my veins

// Not //

It's not the energy reeling
Nor the lines in your face
Nor the clouds on the ceiling
Nor the clouds in space
It's not the phone on the table
Nor the bed in the earth
Nor the bed in the stable
Nor your stable words
It's not the formless being
Nor the cry in the air
Nor the boy I'm seeing
With her long black hair
It's not the open weaving
Nor the furnace glow
Nor the blood of your bleeding
As you try to let go

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a rouse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

Not the meat of your thigh
Nor your spine tattoo
Nor your shimmery eye
Nor the wet of the dew
It's not the warm illusion
Nor the crack in the plate
Nor the breath of confusion
Nor the starkness of slate

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a rouse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

Not what you really wanted
Nor the mess in your purse
Nor the bed that is haunted
With the blanket of thirst
It's not the hunger revealing
Nor the ricochet in the cave
Nor the hand that is healing
Nor the nameless grave

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning
Not a rouse
Not heat
Not the fire lapping up the creek
Not food
Not to eat

Not to die
Not dying
Not to laugh
Not lying
Not the vacant wilderness vying

It's not the room
Not beginning
Not the crowd
Not winning
Not the planet
Not spinning

// Wolf //

Here to the mornin' noon
Woke up as you left the room
Pillow still warm
Scent like meadow grass

Has the feelin' come to pass?
Has the feelin' come to stay?
What can we say?
Wishin' you'd hang around

Livin' on the waterfront
Witnessing the gameless hunt
Mermaids don't kill
That's the way they seem, so fine

Now your lips are on the line
Now there is a broken tongue
Neck is so young
Felt so frozen

Have you seemed to follow through
On everything you yearned for?
Steps so fair
So much certainty

Now, as far as we can see
The water's getting deeper
My safe-keeper
The wolf is howling for me

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

When she holds me in her jaw
All the blood dripping
Will I be free
To cease gripping?

Find me lyin' on the ground
Open hands empty
I'll return back again
If you let me

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

// Replaced //

Goin' to Santa Fe
And make a new beginning
What's that you were starting to say?
Or have you forgotten?

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
We are cleansed by the mystery of the stars
'Cause in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Pull on your new blue coat
Try to remember the words you once wrote
The canyons that catch in your throat
The faultlines that carry the green of the river

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
We are cleansed by the mystery of the stars
'Cause in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Go on, now

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
Be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart
To be replaced by the mystery

// Cut My Hair //

Please cut my hair
Take me to the kitchen
What are the chances?
You have the scissors
Maybe a pair
It's longer than I can even bear

You wanna be alone
Use your ammunition
To empty your arms
You ask me
To leave you
I won't

Not well when life it at your throat
Any, reminds me
The diamond mens are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning

Teeth, drool and beard
Make a clean incision
Hold me for ransom
Tell me I'm pretty
Tell me I'm rare

Talk to the boy in me, he's there
And we do sit though
Swaying in the kitchen
Rocking slowly

Tell him
To sound the
Alarm

Is he gonna keep me safe from harm?
Any, reminds me
The diamond mens are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning
