// Breathe In My Lungs //

Lifting the edge of her bed
Walking a girl to the altar
No love is like this
No sacrifices
My only child, my only daughter
How will I leave your body?

Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms

I have the love of her father
He has the eyes of our daughter
Her eyes are like his
Shining sapphires
I see holy light
I trusted you to fight
Holy light, I trust in you to fight
How will I leave her body?

Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms
Breathe in my lungs and I'll leave in your arms

// Dandelion //

He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers blooming out like armadillos

He looks to the left at the yellow lines
Moving with the traffic
His veins have turned to plastic blinds

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
Where the stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peace and
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
They know, you were mostly our machines
Not electrical in dreams

He's old like the raspberry cold
Coming in the window
His gloom room
Flowers then blooming out like armadillos

He walks with the owls and the yellow moon
Walks like a river lapping
His blood is thick and tacky

He was new like the violet dew
Water looking at him through
The telescopic mountain view
The stars were still laughing

He lept into the northern sky
Filled his lungs with peace and
Never even wondered why

Go with the yellow light
Your mind is a dandelion
The weight of your crooked spine
Is returning to snow
They know, you were mostly our machines
Not electrical in dreams

He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left
He looks to the left

// High Tide //

Hi old friend
How you been?
What's that new glow in your eyes?
I can tell
You're doing well
What's that new look in your eyes
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?
That took so long to realize?

Hi my dear
You're finally here
The water's rising up to my ears
Can I offer you a beer?
The kitchen's rolling in the tide
I'll dive down and get you one if you
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize
It took so long to realize

// I Was Young When I Left Home //

I was young when I left home
And I've been out rambling 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know
Said your mother's dead and gone
Little sister's all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away
Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I can't go home this way
This way, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Well I can't go home thisaway

If you miss the train I'm on
Count the days I'm gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord, Lord, Lord
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

I'm playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On the trestles down by old Jim McKay's
When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Gonna make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord, Lord in the wind
Gonna make me a home out in the wind
I don't, well I don't like it in the wind
I want to come back home again
But I can't go home thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
No I can't go home thisaway

I was young when I left home
And I've been out rambling 'round
And I never wrote a letter to my home

// Light Is As Is //

Same old words
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
I can hear the birds talk to me through them
Light is light, is light, is light, is light
Light is light, is light, is light

I wait
I can see her looking at me sideways
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight (Ooh)
Headlight, headlight, headlight, headlight

I visit the waterfall, early spring
Ring rises high forewarning
Light is light, is light, coyotes roaming
Look who's laughing now
Look who's laughing now

Wind in my hands, wind in my wings
"May I have this dance?" she sings
True romance
Light is light, is light, is light, is light

// Love In Mine //

Put your love in mine
Bid your body same
When your words won't
Tell me everything

When I ramble on
And I often do
Remind me
To travel on to you

Whatever comes
When it comes
Whatever leaves

Would we leave behind
Bare exsiccated shells
We'll be hollowed
And eaten by the hands

Whatever comes (whatever comes)
When it comes (when it comes)
Whatever leaves (whatever leaves)

(Whatever comes)
(When it comes)
(Whatever leaves)

// Mother //

She wears flowers around her neck
She cooks that egg so perfect
To eat it warm
To eat it warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime

She looks that bird in the eye
Cuts his throat and bleeds him dry
To eat him warm
To eat him warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where the spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime

She makes milk inside her breast
She dove down to find what's left
And eat it warm
And eat it warm, warm

And you sleep under her arm
Where the spells fly
To the high white noise
To the highway dime

// Off You //

I've laid this island sun a thousand times
I'm on it, but I'm going strange
This island's chills and shell cover me
With winded rock and skies I've yet to see

I tried, I even sent in friends
They did it as a favor, 'cause I'm not that way
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes

I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin', yeah, we're movin'

This island's sun I've laid a thousand times
Fortune me, fortune me
Of all of my mistakes I think I lent you late
Now every set percent seemed to come my way

But I've never seen a starlet
Or a riot or the violence of you
I am the autumn and the scarlet
I am the make-up on your eyes

I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'

I land to sail, island sail
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'
Yeah, we're movin'

// Vampire Empire //

Watching TV tired, bleeding on the bed
The milk has just expired, all the leaves are dead
I'm not quiet, you've been quiet, just receiving what you said
Reeling feeding feeling filled by everything you fed
I see you as you see yourself through all the books you read
Overwhelmed with guilt and realising the disease

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

I see you there rejecting all your earthly power
Protecting and dissecting 'til you've emptied every hour
We jumped into the pond and then come under the shower
We lay upon my pillow and you open like a flower
I wanted to see you naked, I wanted to hear you scream
I wanted to kiss your skin and your everything
I wanted to be your woman, I wanted to be your man
I wanted to be the one that you could understand

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
I'm her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

I walked into your dagger for the last time in a row
It's like trying to start a fire with matches in the snow
Well, you can't seem to hold me here, you can't seem to let me go
So I can't find surrender, can't keep control
You turn me inside out and then you want me outside in
You spin me all around and then you ask me not to spin
You say you want to be alone and then you want children
You wanna be with me, you wanna be with him

You give me chills
I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills
Alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I'm the fish and she's my gills

Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

// Wait A While //

The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

In my dream last night I was dying
Only one part could come to life again
The portal door opened
I chose my heart, though it was broken

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

On a day as bright as velvet
High in the deep, a ghost with a matchstick
Told me a secret
I tell you now that I swore to keep it

Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary
Wait a while, wait a while, Hillary

The sky is blue with star-shine
Nothing to do that won't hurt to ease my mind
Just thinking of you in the sunshine
Do you think of me too? Does it hurt, or are you feeling fine?
