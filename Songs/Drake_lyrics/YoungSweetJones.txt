// Messages From You //

I forgot about you last night
For the first time in a long time I did, oh
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making
An amazing conversation
With this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A.
And keeps making me laugh and even asks if she can pay
Oh, she could be good for me
Oh, that's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's staring in my face, something had to change
Thought that all these feelings went away
Oh

I hate getting, messages from you, from you
It's like you know the perfect shit to say
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
I hate getting, messages from you, from you
Especially when you say you should've stayed
Fucks up my whole day
I thought that all these feelings went away
Oh

Ooh, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do
But I still text you back, say I miss you too

// I'm Ready For You //

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I'm ready for ya

Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soaking in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you saying no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waiting for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Nothing on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya

I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define "fast"
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm with it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's something that you thought about

I-I, I'm ready for ya

Yeah I hear you talking, don't know who you trying to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

// Right Above It //

Kane is in the building

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

// Do It All //

Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on
I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
That's probably why I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone
I-I-I-I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby, after you
I've had a glass or two so

Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on
I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
That's probably why I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, I still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga, Diddy

Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it's on
I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
That's probably why I'm back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

// The Resistance (Remix) //

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you would've liked it
Uh-uh I-I know you all too well
I said that we can kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it
You could stay but shorty here I go

Termanology... uh
They call me one thing, but they treat me like another
I'm cheating but do I love her, well more than any other
So it's personal, to paint you this type of picture
When your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her
But another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her
Wanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister
Go figure, I ain't got a missus
They say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss
And the hall's shattering, cause life is like a battlefield
And y'all battling cause, you got you a rapper deal
So I guess you start feeling how those rappers feel
Raw dog, hope she go and get that morning after pill
But if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel
Or your career gonna be pushing up daffodils
Take care of yo' kid, go check your mistress
Hit the lab and record, go handle your business
What type of life is this? So many different choices
Too many different opinions, too many different voices
What am I afraid of, just to say love?
I love you baby but, this is what I'm made of
And I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other
So I don't know if Aaliyah's getting a little brother
But all I know is I already got one baby mother
And that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say – you promised me you would never change
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh
You promised me you would never change
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh (oh)

Uh, am I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on
Now that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on, get my fuckin' buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
But hit redial, you'll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all
And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texting saying she wish she woulda kept it
The one that I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is
I'm holding on by a thread it's
Like I'm high right now, the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of?
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I don't have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say – you promised me you would never change
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh
You promised me you would never change
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh (oh)

Well alright, uh
I live by some advices girl, Lisa told me
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me
Uh, which made me question when I went missing
And when I start treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick-up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up
Or the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up
I know, but same time I'm quick to forget
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time?
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?
Yeah.. I just need some closure
Ain't no turning back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over

// Still Got It //

I feel good I got some time off, girl it's been so long
Did you have fun? 'Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
What you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
And even though we let it go it's better that you know

I feel good I got some time off, girl it's been so long
Did you have fun? 'Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home

You want that feeling back?
Well you should know

I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you
I still got it for you, I still got it for you

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me

Every time I come around

Round! I gotta hundred girls in each phone
Drizzy Drake, mayne—Young Sweet Jones
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home
Losing track of time, every day, we switchin' zones
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage getting stoned
Thank Me Later, man, a million copies shipped and gone
Overboard, nigga; I'm quoted more, nigga
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more, nigga
Swimming in the money, y'all just float ashore, nigga
Never drowning, what the fuck you think this boat is for, nigga?
Yeah, I'm quick to take a R&B diva out
I bring some friends
She bring some friends that know what we about
And when it's done, I put my slippers on and see 'em out
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route
I swear these women living like they tryna write a book after
But I'm just really tryna keep it G for my chapter
Listen to my words, see just what I mean
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm riding clean, damn!

Ugh! Since you're telling on me, tell the world about me

// In My Business //

I'm so fuckin' dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
There's a diamond on my dick so there's a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained I came here just so I can come
There's nothing under God's sun that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, getting pussy just isn't one
Girls are like buses every 15 min they run
Now they like potato chips I just can't have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like your friends in my business
And I feel like you don't deserve a visit
Cause you ain't in the kitchen when you want a whipping

Uh, uh ah
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don't believe you

Uh, OK I'm all about it, all for it
I'm all star team Jordan, small forward
I'm never putting up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I'm shooting if I draw for it
Pow, Pow, fuck is up, naw man I'm in this ho
Life is moving fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go
Mixtape dropped then I started getting 10 a show
Now I get a hundred what the fuck you think I'm in it for
Young money forever, I bet Gudda, Jay and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend their time attacking me
Shout out to your girlfriend nigga lately she distracting me
Wondering if I'm the best, Well-I-am, no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggas gotta wanna be you
Lining up around the block so that they can get to see you
I feel like I find a wife exactly when I need to
So you can say whatever girl but we just don't believe you

Uh, uh ah
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don't believe you

Ain't that your girl
Ain't that your money
Ain't you the same nigga that say she want you that you funny
Ain't you a gangster, yeah funny
You gave em funny, gave you to you, fucking dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses
Gucci say niggas asking why, why you with my girl
She let me get it nigga
She ain't stupid, go turn up your radio
I'm the next young Lionel Richie
I gives a fuck about doing a fucking cameo
We don' love em, we don' love em, we don' love em, no!
They just love us, they just love us, 'cause we stack them Os
'Cause we whip it, watch her whip it when she whip it all
That's gon' hit, once they mention catching feelings two word don't go

Uh, uh ah
I know you say you love me girl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you prol tell that shit to everybody
So we hear you talking boo boo but we just don't believe you

// You Know, You Know //

You know, you know
You know, you know

Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck

They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

You know, you know
You know, you know

Uh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're court-side when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that '62 sitting outside? That's me there
I'm jumping to the top it's my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Crus, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn't what your motive is

They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

You know, you know
You know, you know

// To The Floor //

Girl, do whatever you like it's your bar
Oh girl, tonight it's on me
Baby tell me what you want

Me in the zone, gon' on Patron
In a club, in a club, playing her song
That's when I slowly approach
She like daddy what you know
Told the girl (on my drink)
Then she drop it down low

To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor

To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor

To the floor, to the floor
She took it to the floor

OK, OK, sittin' in an owner's box
And in the Caribbean twistin' off Corona tops
I'm sittin' down hittin' half court floater shot
Bitches takin' pictures because every night's a photo op
Yeah, and nothing has been photo shopped
I say I'mma buy the bar and they say nigga no you're not
I be satisfied with the percentage that my lawyer got
Makin' other people rich is something I enjoy a lot
Uh, can you tell even when your girl won't
I'mma still be feelin' me even when the world don't
Shit just changed forever first I get a lot of dough
Then I end up with your woman that's just how it's gotta go
Yeah, and I can tell her things and treat her right
You can get whatever baby remember you and me tonight
Throw the pussy at me guarantee that you won't see a strike
I'mma hit it hard you gon' think you Derek Jeter wife
Uh, tell me, how does that sound?
I can get it ass up and with your back down
Spit that all suki suki in your ear
It's the nigga Rich Boy and the rookie of the year

// Greatness //

Uh, I am a distraction
Coming from my spot and I don't signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin' centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I'm with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
One lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate the greatness, nigga

I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It's more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!
