// Got To Love Somebody //

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

Tired of movies all by myself
I'm sure, you folks know what I mean
My time has come and I need someone
To share my popcorns and jellybeans

Looked in the mirror, it all got clearer
I won't let my life pass me by
Stop feelin' sorry for myself
Fish are biting, I'll throw out my line

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

Must be careful and watch my step
I hope the shock is very mild
I'll change my hair and change my style
Watch out, I might just go wild

I got to get out and live
And show the world how much I can give
I'm gonna do it all by myself
I'll make a love you can't put on a shelf

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody
I've got to love somebody today
I've got to love somebody soon

// You Fooled Around //

Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love

Boy, you came along
And you took my heart
Gave it quite a start
You had a love, fit like a glove
Yes, it was the perfect love
Don't get me wrong
But I've heard that song
I've seen that dance
And I've known romance
All this to say, it's a new day
I've spoken to the owl, the jig is up!

Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around

And you fell in love

Now, there you go
You found a toy, that brings you joy
The love I feel it still reamins
But you're not the same
I've seen the change
You've been acting strange
I feel the pain
I can't stand the strain
What can I do
I still love you
Wanting you, needing you, holding you,
Loving you

Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love

// I'm A Good Girl //

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

If, then, when, I don't want you baby,
I can't stop the feeling.
It just seems to happen.

And if, then, when
I don't need you baby.
I can't help myself.
You always see through it.

I don't know what is this feeling I feel.
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

If, then, when, I first met you boy,
You know it'd be good.
Oh, but never like this.

And if, then, when you're so bad.
I can't hurt you, no
'Cause I'll just hurt myself.

I don't know what is this feeling I feel.
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Hey. Ooh. Ah.

What is this feeling I'm feeling?
I don't like it. I don't like it.
Tell me what, what's come over me.
I'm a good girl.

// Easy Street //

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

I've spent some time on lonely street
Right 'crosstown that's where I used to be
When I fell by the wayside you see
I got wrapped up in me
And moved to only street
I was searching high and low
Looking for a place to go
I caught the bus of opportunity
Hopped into the front seat
And I got off on

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Poundin' down the meanest streets
And my stomach's wonderin'
Where am I gonna get my next meal
Been handed quite a deal
My cycle's incomplete
I had corns on my feet
From the hours I walked the beat
I'd like to drop it from my memory
I found a way in me to wake the dead end

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

// Reach Your Peak //

I'd like to see		
You reach your peak	
And feel the beat		
That gets to me.		

I'd like to see
You reach that sunny day
I hope you can achieve
All of the things you say
But if you don't make it
Don't give up, just fake it
You're not whipped yet
A-come on and try and forget.
I'd like to see		
You reach your peak	
And feel the beat		
That gets to me.	
You occupy
Your time with such silly things

Do you have to go
Everytime a phone rings
And when you don't get
What you want, don't fret
You know it's coming, baby
Relax and stop your running.
I'd like to see		
You reach your peak	
And feel the beat		
That gets to me.
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
(And feel the beat that gets to me)
If you really wanna reach your peak
You better follow me because I'm reachin', hey, hey
Hey hey, I feel the rhythm, baby,
Yes, I'm reachin' my peak
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
I'm reachin' my peak, I'm reachin' my peak
(And feel the beat that gets to me)
I'm reachin' my peak, I'm reachin' my peak, yeah
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
Woo
(And feel the beat that gets to me).

// Pretty Baby //

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

In the light of the dawn
A pretty babe was born
Her mother, she had sworn
To take good care of her

Every night Mom would pray
Her life would not be torn
Her clothes would not be worn
Until they dropped off of her

My child, you dear
Don't have no fear, I'll shed the tears
Keep your head clear, my pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

Little girl, I want you to attend the finest schools
And never be a fool, I've got experience
Learn all that you can, you'll find that in the end
You'll learn how to depend on yourself

It makes me glad
You have the things I didn't have
Never be sad, my pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't

Pretty baby grew into a lady
Pretty baby grew into a lady

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
Pretty baby grew into a lady

The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

// How To Love //

I know how to sing a pretty song
I can carry on talking all night long
But, when it comes to you
I don't know what to do

I guess I never knew how to love
I have to fulfill all of my dreams
My frustrations are bursting at the seams
Sometimes I don't have time
When you want to wine and dine

But, you are still the one I'm thinking of
I guess I never knew how to love
I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew how to love
I never knew just how to love

I didn't plan to be a star
Didn't you tell me to be just what you are?
You're so important to be
These things I have to be
I guess I never knew how to love

I see you, why you want to go?
I love, but it doesn't show
I am just being myself
Can't be anybody else

But, you are still the one I'm thinking of
I just don't know how to love
I just don't know how, how to love
When it comes you
I just don't know what to do

No, no, I don't know how to love, love baby
I just don't know what to do

I guess I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew how to love

Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you

// Let's Go On Vacation //

Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation

Now and then I feel
Our love is condemned
I wanna get back on the right track
I won't pretend that everything's all right
A double L R I G H T for me
'Cause our love was built on honesty
Folks say that Philly is a city of brotherly love
You know it's a pity that we cannot
Trust each other anymore
Let's leave the big metropolis
And head down to the shore

Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation

Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation

California here we come
To your golden sun sinking in the sand
We'll go walking hand in hand
Through the streets of Beverly Hills
Don't care if we're exhausted
With the prices going up
We feel the cost is very very cheap
The price of love is steep
A holiday we need
It's a perfect remedy
City lights are far behind us
There will be nothing in our path to blind us

Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
Let's go - go on vacation
Our love could stand a renovation
