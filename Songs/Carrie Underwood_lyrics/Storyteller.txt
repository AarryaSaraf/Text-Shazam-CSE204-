// Renegade Runaway //

Looks like an angel, so picturesque
Looks like she walked right out of the wild, wild west
She's a devil in a satin dress
You don't even know her hair trigger's aimin' right at your chest
By the time you figure out that she gave you the runaround
You won't know where she's at
She's a tumbleweed blowin' in the wind come sundown
Call a girl like that

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away

You'll see her name, alive or dead
Yeah, they'll take her either way cause she's wanted
If I were you, I'd place my bet
That she's ridin' off out into the sunset

With her long hair flyin' 'cross the desert dirt
Let me tell you, boy, you're never gonna catch her

Renegade runaway
She's a sure shot, knock the ash off a smokin' cigarette
Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Oh baby, run away

Young gunslinger makin' you a mess
Tough as nails under that corset
Call her renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway

Yeah, that pretty face
Love you, leave you, play you like a heartbreak bandit
She's an outlaw, a quick draw
She'll take it all, so don't you fall
For that renegade
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
You better run away, run away, run away, run away
She's a renegade

// Dirty Laundry //

That lipstick on your collar, well, it ain't my shade of pink
And I can tell by the smell of that perfume, it's like forty dollars too cheap
And there's a little wine stain on the pocket of your white cotton thread
Well, you drink beer and whiskey, boy, and you know I don't drink red

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

If the neighbors get to asking, I won't cover nothin' up
I'll tell 'em every little detail, how you drug me through the mud
I'm gonna string up your old button-down and slide it on the porch
Just in case you get the nerve to come knockin' on my door

Yeah, I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

Found it over in the corner
Wadded up on the bedroom floor
You shoulda hid it in the closet
You shoulda burned it, you shoulda lost it

Now I'ma have to hang you out to dry, dry, dry
Clothespin all your secrets to the line, line, line
Leave 'em blowing in the wind, just say goodbye to you
All those midnights sneaking in
"I'm late again, oh, I'm so sorry"
All the Ajax in the world ain't gonna clean your dirty laundry

(Out to dry)
(To the line)
(To the line)

// Church Bells //

Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

It was all roses, dripping in diamonds
Sipping on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Taking his last name

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And having dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always getting way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil living in his eyes

It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing
Yeah, they're ringing

// Heartbeat //

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh whoa, and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Yeah, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh

// Smoke Break //

She's a small-town, hard-workin' woman
Just tryna make a livin'
Workin' three jobs, feeding four little mouths
In a run-down kitchen
When you're never takin' nothin' and doin' nothin' but givin'
It's hard to be a good wife and a good mom and a good Christian

She said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sippin' from a highball glass
Let the world fade away"
She said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a smoke break"

He's a big-city, hard-workin' man just tryna climb the ladder
First generation to go to college instead of drivin' a tractor
Never had nothin' handed to him on a silver platter
It's hard to be a good man, good son
Do somethin' good that matters

He said, "I don't drink
But sometimes I wanna pop that top
Take a swig and make the world stop
And watch it fade away"
He said, "I don't smoke
But sometimes I wanna light it up
Yeah, when things get tough
Sometimes I need a smoke break"
Yeah

So here's to you and here's to when the day gets long
Go ahead, I understand if you wanna take a load off

I don't drink
But sometimes I need a stiff drink
Sipping from a highball glass
Let the world fade away
Yeah, and I don't smoke
But sometimes I need a long drag
Yeah, I know it might sound bad
But sometimes I need a, sometimes I need a

When the day gets long
When the work's all done
When the sun sets
When you need to forget
Grab that cup, mmm
Fill it up
Sip it slow
And let it all go
Ooh

// Choctaw County Affair //

Well, life's been kind of trippy down here in Mississippi
Since Cassie O'Grady disappeared
And me and Bobby Shaver been in all the newspapers
Every day for nigh on a year
They say we got tangled in a love triangle
A fatal game of truth or dare

But the truth remains a mystery and now it's ancient history
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Well, people talkin' 'bout it everywhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, Cassie O'Grady was no Southern lady
Despite all the media hype
They all loved to make her out like a sweet little devout
All-American cheerleader type
But her mind was cattywampus
She was greedy, she was pompous
Strutting 'round with her nose in the air

She was a cold gold-digger tickling a hair trigger
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
And now they say she's lying dead somewhere (Choctaw County affair)

Well, I do not deny, I wished Cassie would die
When she threatened us with blackmail
She said she had some information that would wreck my reputation
And land Bobby back in jail
Now it's best to remember Bobby Shaver's got a temper
Like a buck-shot grizzly bear

But there's no body, there's no witness
So y'all go mind your business
It's a Choctaw County affair
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Oh, you mess with Bobby and you better beware (Choctaw County affair)
Yeah yeah-yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, the press went wild on the day of the trial
When they put us on the witness stand
They thought we'd turn on each other, but soon they all discovered
We would live or die, hand in hand
And that fancy D.A. from down Jackson way
Said he'd see us in the electric chair, ha

But the foreman of the jury told me "Honey, don't you worry, it's a Choctaw county affair", yeah
(Choctaw County affair)
Yeah, it's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair), yeah
How would you know 'cause you weren't there (Choctaw County affair)
It's just a Choctaw County affair (Choctaw County affair)
Mmm, yeah, yeah (Choctaw County affair)

// Like I'll Never Love You Again //

You're gonna run out of cigarettes
And we're gonna run out of wine
We haven't even started the good stuff yet
It's OK, we've got plenty of time
So pull up a comfortable chair, baby
And put on those records that drive me crazy
You look so good in this light
Oh yeah, you look like nothing but mine

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Oh, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again

Let's make this night last forever
Like honey dripping sweet and slow
Every kiss just tasting better
Every touch, every whisper, let go

I wanna love you like the world's gonna stop
Til the very last second, last tick of that clock
I'm gonna slow it all down and then take you from zero to ten
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
Ooh, yeah

I wanna love you like the rain on a roof
Stronger than a bottle of 110 proof
I wanna take love to places that love has never been
Yeah, I wanna love you like I'll never love you again
And I'll love you again
Oh, and again

// Chaser //

I need something strong tonight
I'm needing me a 100-proof
Something to erase my mind
Rid me of the thought of you

Ain't gonna water it down when I say it out loud
I'm gonna mean it when I'm telling you goodbye
You're lookin' in my eyes, but seeing somebody else
Yeah, I never should have fell

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doin' me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her

Yeah, the grass ain't always greener
Over on the other side
You never learn when you're a leaver
It's just a part of your design

'Cause you're the kind that can't stay for too long in the same place
You'll be looking for me when you change your mind

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
You're looking at me and thinking of her
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doin' me any kind of favors
Sticking around this one-horse town tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love of the game
It's the get what you want and then you throw it away
It's the rush of the fall, not the land
It's the catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

Yeah, boy, you're nothing but a chaser
And it cuts me like a razor
And you ain't doin' me any kind of favors tonight
You can follow her tracks; you can try to win her back
Put the miles on your tires 'til you run out of gas
I'm done letting you be my heartbreaker
So go ahead and chase her
So go ahead and chase her

It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can
It's the thrill, it's the hunt, it's the love
Catch her if you can, catch her, catch her if you can

// Relapse //

If anyone asks, you never saw me
And I know you know better than to call me
Let's just hide out under the covers
One more secret between two old lovers
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I know I said, I said it was over
But it's hard when I miss you to stay sober
So if I show up here at your door again
Oh, it's just me falling off of the wagon
What can it hurt?

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

I can quit when I'm ready (I can quit)
I ain't hurting nobody but me

I ain't hung up on you
I ain't in love with you
This is just time that I'm wasting
One or two little sips
I'm alright, I can quit
You're just someone that I've tasted

I don't have to have you
I don't need to need you
Just a high that I'm chasing
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse
Oh, no
Don't think I'm coming back
It's just a relapse

// Clock Don't Stop //

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
He's wrong, she's right
(No kiss goodnight)
Ring ring, telephone
Act like I'm not home
Can't hear the tears cry
(On the other end of the line)

And the minutes turn to hours
And they're flying like a jet plane
And we'll make it right tomorrow
But tomorrow's not a sure thing

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away

Head's scared, heart broke
Burned from a band of gold
Rather just be alone
(Burns, just a bad joke)
Bang bang on a drum
You're not a setting sun
You ain't even close to done
(Run, baby, run run)

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right
Kiss me goodnight

The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
Away
Always hanging on the wall
No, it don't care at all
It won't slow down; it won't wait
The clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away
It's ticking away
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Red dress, spilled wine
Caught in a stupid fight
I'm wrong, you're right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away)

Clock don't sto-o-o-op ticking away

// The Girl You Think I Am //

Front row center in that little white church
I was singing 'bout a baby laying in a manger
Eight years old wearing angel wings
Yeah, and to this day, that's what you see

I've been daddy's little girl since my first cry
And it was hard turning eighteen, saying goodbye
You told me I was gonna take the world by storm
And Mama said you cried all the way home

You think I'm strong, you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm in my weakest
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

I got my flaws and I've got regrets
And I know there's more on the road ahead
When I wonder if I'll ever measure up
Oh, I thank God for a father's love

Cause you think I'm brave, and you think I'm beautiful
You think that I can do the impossible
You always see the best in me when I can't
I wanna be the girl you think I am

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
The girl you think I am, yeah
Ooh
Ooh, yeah

All I want, more than anything
Is to make you proud of me

Cause you think I'm strong, and you think I'm fearless
Even when I'm, I'm in my weakest
You believe in me, yeah, you're my biggest fan
So I wanna be the girl you think I am
I wanna be the girl you think I am

// Mexico //

Red sun, saltwater dripping, haze
Stick-shift, summer Sahara, chains
We ain't alone

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico

Look for the golden sombrero
Puerto Nuevo West
Blondes have a little too much fun
I'll be brunette
AdiÃ³s 'til then

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico
Oh, oh, oh

Run, run, run

Blue lights on the horizon
Dust clouds filling the sky
If they get the cuffs on us
It's 25 to life
Run, run, your own direction
And I'll lead 'em down a different road
Take the gun, hide the car and the money
I'll meet you in Mexico
Oh, oh, oh

Crossing that border passport says Jane Doe
For a little while, baby, just lay low
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico
Suntan, seaside, feeling that breeze blow
We'll be sipping that smooth Don Julio
Oh oh oh, I'll meet you in Mexico, yeah
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh

// What I Never Knew I Always Wanted //

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

Never was the kind to think about dressing in white
Wasn't waiting on a prince to come riding into my life
Thought I was happy on my own
'Til you came and proved me wrong

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)

Never pictured myself singing lullabies
Sittin' in a rocking chair in the middle of the night
In the quiet, in the dark
You're stealing every bit of my heart with your daddy's eyes
What a sweet surprise

And now I'm holdin' what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up, oh, with your love

Life has a way of showing you just what you need
And who you were made to be, yeah

I finally found what I never knew I always wanted
I couldn't see; I was blind 'til my eyes were opened
I didn't know there was a hole
Something missing in my soul
'Til you filled it up with your love
Yeah, you filled it up with your love, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)

I never was the kind to think about dressing in white
I never pictured myself singing lullabies

// Heartbeat (Stripped) //

I love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd, oh
But I can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
Red wine, good times, no I don't mind being with everyone else
And then there's nights like tonight that I, I want you to myself

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder
Baby, we won't need a song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss
What are we waiting on?

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound
A cricket choir in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh, we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, beatin' faster in your chest

And tonight, I wanna drive so far, we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights and I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, with the
River rolling in the background, underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
We're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat, oh

// Little Girl Don't Grow Up Too Fast //

Little princess, summer flowers in her hair
Playing "Ring Around the Rosie" in a picture there
Tiptoeing 'round the house in her mama's shoes
Coloring her lips red in her bedroom

Prom queen wants to be like the magazines
Thinks she found her king, barely seventeen
Too much that the world's wanting you to do
When you're still just a child in your mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that?
Somewhere down the road
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread
Climbing ladders trying to get to the next step
Working hard, always wanting something more
Missing how things were simple like it was before

'Cause it's hard to know just what to do
When I still feel like a child in my mama's shoes

Little girl, little girl, don't grow up too fast
'Fore you know it, you'll be wishing you could just go back
Don't you know there'll be plenty of time for that
Somewhere down the road?
Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Ooh, yeah

Sometimes I wish I could just go back and say
"Take your time and let it last, little girl"

Yeah, it's all gonna fly in the blink of an eye
You can't slow down this thing called life
So take your time and let it last
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Little girl, don't grow up too fast
Yeah, yeah
