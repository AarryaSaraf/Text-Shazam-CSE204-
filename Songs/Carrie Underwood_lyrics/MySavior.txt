// Nothing But The Blood Of Jesus //

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

For my cleansing, this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon is my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oooh, oooh

Nothing can thy sin erase
This is all my hope and peace
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Ohhh, ohhh, oooh, oooh

// Blessed Assurance //

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
And angels, descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

Ooh-ooh
Mmm, mmm

Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blest
Watching and waiting, looking above
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
Praising my Savior all the day long

// Just As I Am //

Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt
Fighting and fears within, without
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve
Because Thy promise I believe
O Lamb of God, I come, I come

Ooh ooh, just as I am
Ooh ooh, I come
Ooh ooh, just as I am
Oh Lamb of God I come

Oh Lamb of God I come

// Victory In Jesus //

I heard an old, old story, how a Savior came from glory
How He gave His life on Calvary to save a wretch like me
I heard about His groaning, of His precious blood's atoning
Then I repented of my sins and won the victory, yeah

Oh, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

I heard about His healing, of His cleansing power revealing
How He made the lame to walk again and 'caused the blind to see
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit"
And somehow Jesus came and brought me to the victory

Victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood...

Oh yeah...
Sweet, sweet Jesus...
Mmm...
Oooh...
Mmm...

Yes, victory in Jesus, my Savior forever
He sought me, and He bought me with His redeeming blood
He loved me 'ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

Yes, He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood

// Great Is Thy Faithfulness //

Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me

Summer and winter and springtime and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness,
Great is Thy faithfulness,
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me
