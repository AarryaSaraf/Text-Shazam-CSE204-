// Flat On The Floor //

I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me why
You gotta make me, make me, make me, make me, make me cry
Oh, Lord
If I told you once, I told you a thousand times
You can't knock me off my feet, when I'm already on my knees

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Baby, baby, baby, baby, tell me how
You think you're gonna live without my love now
I don't know why you gotta keep comin' around
Creepin' up my street
Oh boy, you can't bother me

Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

You ain't gonna get to me tonight
I'll lay right here 'til it all rolls through
I ain't gonna raise my body
'Til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign, 'til there ain't no sign of you

'Cause I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets
I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets
Now I'm flat on the floor with my head down low
Where the sky can't rain on me anymore
Don't knock on my door 'cause I won't come
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

Oh
Don't knock on my door
I'm hiding from the storm 'til the damage gets done

// All-American Girl //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

And now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it, he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, "Hey, son, what's your problem?
Tell me, have you lost your mind?"
And Daddy said, "You'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye"

But now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, "Be honest, tell me what you want"
And he said, "Honey, you oughta know
Sweet little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American"

Now he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet little
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect All-American girl

All-American girl

// So Small //

Yeah, yeah, yeah

What you got if you ain't got love?
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else
Seem so small

Yeah, yeah

// Just A Dream //

It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Sixpence in a shoe
Something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh, she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hand

Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said, "Let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt"
Then the congregation all stood up and sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh, baby, why'd you leave me?
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know

It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream
Yeah, yeah

// Get Out Of This Town //

Got it all figured out inside of my head
There's a bag packed up at the foot of my bed
You say the word, baby, I'm all set
We'll cover our tracks, tell a couple white lies
Make sure we got a good alibi
And by the time they catch on, we'll be outta their sight
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

Don't need directions, don't need a map
If we get lost, I'll be good with that
Yeah, we'll find a way to make the time pass
Windows rolled down with the heat on high
Stars all aligned in a runaway sky
Holding my hand as the miles roll by
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

If we leave tonight and drive fast enough
All of our troubles will be just like us
Long gone, baby

Let's get out of this town tonight
Nothing but dust in the shadows
Gone by morning light
Somewhere we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Yeah, let's get out of this town
Let's get out of this town tonight
Yeah, we won't ever get caught, ever be found
Baby, let's just get out of this town

// Crazy Dreams //

Hello you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, dashboard drummers
Hello you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom
There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

I stood at the bottom of some walls I thought I couldn't climb
I felt like Cinderella at the ball, just running out of time
So I know how it feels to be afraid
And think that it's all gonna slip away
Hold on, hold on

Here's to you free souls, you firefly chasers
Tree climbers, porch swingers, air guitar players
Here's to you fearless dancers, shaking walls in your bedrooms

There's a lot of wonder left inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true

Never let a bad day be enough
To go and talk you in to giving up
Sometimes everybody feels like you
Oh, feels like you, just like you
Yeah

I've met some go-getters
Some difference makers
Small town heroes, and big chance takers
I've met some young hearts with something to prove
Oh, yeah

Here's to you long shots
You dark horse runners
Hairbrush singers, and dashboard drummers
Here's to you wild magnolias
Just waiting to bloom

There's a little bit of all that inside of me and you
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Thank God even crazy dreams come true
Yeah

// I Know You Won't //

I know you don't mean to be mean to me
'Cause when you want to, you can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately, you make me feel all I am is a back-up plan
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget
Everything I said

I buy into those eyes
And into your lies

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

I wish you were where you're supposed to be, close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
There's still no sound

Of footsteps on my stairs
Or your voice anywhere

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

// Last Name //

Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!

We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!

Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, "Hey, cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh, no! What have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done?
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh, what have I done?
I don't even know my last name
Well, it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Hey, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, yeah-eh, oh

It started off, "Hey cutie, where you from?"
And then it turned into, "Oh no, what have I done?"
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah

// You Won't Find This //

Did you check the tires? Put gas in the car?
Don't think you need too much, 'cause you ain't gonna get that far
Did you pack the good times?
Don't forget a map
Just in case the route you take isn't there to take you back

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end, close is all there is
But you won't find this
No, you won't find this

There's once in a lifetime
And there's once in a while
And the difference between the two is about a million miles
Oh, you might get lucky while the moon is looking up
But in the truth of the morning, the stars will be long gone

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end, close is all there is
But you won't find this

You can hold any girl that you like
Fall in love when it's easy at night
But you'll wake up wondering why she ain't ever something better
When you're lost and you run out of road
Find what I already know
In the end, close is all there is
Oh, in the end, it's me you're going to miss
'Cause you won't find this
Oh, you won't find this

// I Told You So //

Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I wanna come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?

Would you say I told you so? Oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

// More Boys I Meet //

This boy here wants to move too fast
He sees my future as having a past
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

That boy there, well, he's playing a fool
He thinks he's funny and he thinks he's cool
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

Cheap date, bad taste, another night gone to waste
Talking about nothing in so many words
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog

Here's this guy, thinks he's bad to the bone
He wants to pick me up and take me home
Well, I don't think so
I don't think so

Cage fights, PlayStation, X-Games, Raider Nation
Oversize pants with an ego to match
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

And I, I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog

Why can't they be like the one's that mean everything to me?
The warm and loyal, open and friendly
It's not like I'm not tryin'
'Cause I'll give anyone a shot once

I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time finding
The more boys I meet, the more I love my
I close my eyes
And, I kiss that frog
Each time findin'
The more boys I meet, the more I love my dog

The more I love my dog

// Twisted //

Baby, you're a wrecking ball
Crashing into me
Nothing I can do but fall
Piece by piece
You broke down every part of me
That ever thought I'd never need you, baby

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong

Everybody's telling me
I'm over my head
If they don't feel you loving me
They all say that I've gone crazy
Maybe, but it's too late now to save me
I'm too tangled

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Maybe it's not right
But that's alright
Yeah, it's alright tonight

It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
It's twisted, messed up
And the more I think about it
It's crazy, but so what
I may never understand it
I'm caught up and I'm hanging on
I'm gonna love you even if it's wrong
Even if it's twisted

Even if it's just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little twisted
Yeah
It's twisted
Yeah

// Wheel Of The World //

Love goes out, out like a light
Out like a flame, and you can't find it anymore
Just when you think it's lost in the rain
It comes back knocking at your door

It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
And around

God put us here on this carnival ride
We close our eyes
Never knowing where it'll take us next
Babies are born, and at the same time, someone's taking their last breath

It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around

In the blink of an eye
It can change your life
And it never even slows down
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world

I don't know what it is
I'm flying high
Then I'm wondering why I'm sinking on this ship, going down
Life keeps on movin' anyway

It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel of the world turning around
It's the wheel of the world
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
And around
And around (Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)

It can open your heart
It can break you apart
And it never even slows down

It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
It's the wheel (It's the wheel) of the world turning around
(Keeps on turning)
And around

// Sometimes You Leave //

All the raindrops
In the sky tonight
Can't compare with all the pain
And all the tears I've cried
But now I'm done

All the make believe
Locked in this picture frame
Is gonna stay behind
Along with all the burning rage
That's been tearing through my heart
It's killing me slowly
Every beat, I was falling apart

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

All this time I've spent
Staring at the door
I never had the strength
To pack my bags and leave before
But now I'm done
Lying to myself when it's clear
That you're not the one

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

When there's nothing left
For me to leave behind
And you're already too far gone
To say goodbye

Sometimes you give
Sometimes they take
Sometimes you bend
And sometimes they break you down
Sometimes you stick around
Trying to change them
Make them someone that they'll never be
And sometimes you leave

Sometimes you leave
