// Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun //

Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

// Arnold Layne //

Arnold Layne
Had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall
Hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He done it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same
Takes two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again

// See Emily Play //

Emily tries, but misunderstands (Ah-ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow
Somebody's dreams till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries (Ah-ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow
Hardly a sound till tomorrow

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown
That touches the ground (Ah-ooh)
Float on a river
Forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

// Fearless //

You say the hill's too steep to climb
Chiding
You say you'd like to see me try
Climbing

You pick the place and I'll choose the time

And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things you've said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns 'round
Frowning

And who's the fool who wears the crown?

And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd

Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!

// Free Four //

One, two, free, four!

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long, cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye
Eighty years, with luck, or even less

So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe you'll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die

// Brain Damage //

The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more

And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane

You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

// Eclipse //

All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel

And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save

And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow or steal

And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say

And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight

And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon

There is no dark side of the moon, really
Matter of fact, it's all dark
