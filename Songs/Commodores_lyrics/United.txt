// Goin' To The Bank //

She knows I want her
She knows I need her

She knows she got my love.
But I'm apprehensive
She's so expensive
Girl

Just can't get enough.
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
Hustlin' for my bread

While she's decidin' what dress to buy

Layin' around in my bed.

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me
Got me.

Drives my Mercedes
Lunch with the ladies

She loves the finer things.
What have I created

Now I'm afraid to see what tomorrow brings.
She don't know what it does to me trying to keep her in line

If love is just a big charge account

Why'd it have to be mine?

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me
Got me.

Hello! - Oh hi
Can I help you today? -
Yeah
I'd like to make another withdrawal.
- Again? - Yeah
Again.
Well
As you know
By now there is a substantial penalty for early withdrawal.

She knows I love her
Knows how I need her

She knows I really care.
I can't afford her

I should've taught her I ain't no billionaire.
Gotta get her to understand soon the will be dry

If she don't love the simple things
Maybe I'm the wrong guy.

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me
Got me.

She thinks she saves me money buyin' everything on sale.
But she believes in quantity
Now I'm afraid to open my mail.
Goin' fo the bank
She got me goin' to the bank.

Now the girl's gotta look good for me

But this is going too far.
'Cause she won't feel so beautiful when they repossess my car.
Goin' to the B-A-N-K
She got me goin' to the bank.

Goin' to the bank
She got me goin' to the bank.
She keeps me runnin' to the bank
She got me
Got me.
Goin' to the B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K
B-A-N-K.

// United In Love //

It isn't always easy
We've been through a few hard times
But when we stick together
There's no mountain we can't climb

With all that we've been through
And everything we've done
Nothing comes between us - we stand as one

United in love - there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love - whatever happens to us
United in love - we'll always be
United in love - so united

And if you reach your hand out
But your dreams just seem too far
Stand upon my shoulders
And you can touch that star

The road that we are on
May lead into the night
But we will walk together into the light

United in love - there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love - whatever happens to us
United in love - we'll always be
United in love - so united

As sure as day follows night
No matter who is wrong or right
No matter what we do or say
We always come away

United in love - there's nothing we can't rise above
United in love - whatever happens to us
United in love - we'll always be
United in love - so united

And if we stand by each other
Always respect one another
There's nothin' we can't do, no
There's nothin' we, we won't get through
No, no, no, no, we're so united

// Can't Dance All Night //

Looking like a dream out on the floor
You haven't stopped since you walked in the door
I can't take my eyes of you
And I can feel you like me too
But all you wanna do is dance some more

This night was made for love
(This night was made for love)
When you gonna realise

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in extacy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance all night, ooh

Quick before the rhythm starts to fade
One more dance
And then we'll steal away yeah
Stop this game of cat and mouse
It's time to let your feelings out
And write an ending to this passion play

This night was made for us
(This night was made for us)
I see the lovelights in your eyes, oh

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in extacy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance all night, auww

This night was made for love
(This night was made for love)
When you gonna realise

Oh, you can't dance all night
So come home with me
And in the morning light
We'll be lying in extacy, my love

You know how to move
And you do it so right
But you can't dance, can't dance, all night

You can't dance all night

Well you can't dance, can't dance all night

Can't dance all night

We'll be lying in extacy, my love
You know how to move and you do it so right

// Talk To Me //

Come on in,
Talk baby
I'm all alone another night
Where've you been pretty, pretty baby
Don't wanna hear another lie

Open up,
Talk to me,
Don't be afraid to speak your mind.
Come on in, (settle down, settle down)
Come on in baby (settle down)

You got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
You got to talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Need to know
Hey darling
What's going on
Things ain't right
I hear your friends whispering baby
It don't take long 'cause the rumors fly
I want to know
Talk to me
I'm losing all my self control
So come on in baby, (settle down, settle down)
Come on in darling (settle down)

You know you got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
You got to talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Tell me what's on your mind oh baby

You know that I've been waiting
You've got to talk to me
You'd better use persuasion
That will keep me from setting you free
You've got to talk

What's on your mind
I just don't know
I've been wondering what to do what to say
We can solve any problem
Just open up and communicate

So come on in, (settle down, settle down)
I want you to come on in baby (settle down) ohh

You got to talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
Talk to me
You got to let me know what's on your mind

Talk I want you to talk
Talk to me
You got to tell me what is on your mind
Talk
Just talk
Why don't you talk to me
You've got to tell me what is on your mind
Baby talk, talk to me
You got to let me know whats on you mind
Talk
Drive me crazy
Talk
I want you to
Talk
Talk
Talk
I want you to
Talk
