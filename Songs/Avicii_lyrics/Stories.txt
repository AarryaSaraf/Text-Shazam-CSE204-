// Waiting For Love //

Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated

For every tyrant a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If there's love in this life we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated

Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around

// Talk To Myself //

Alone, I'm searching for devotion, in the faded melody
My soul is trying to cross an ocean, down on bended knee
Lock up my condense and rhyme, don't know what I'm trying to say
(My heart) all the time was stolen, by bad poetry

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open, love's insanity
So long words are left unspoken, couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
(My heart) I'm left with a broken vocabulary

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

// Touch Me //

When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), 
touch me (do me like you're gonna do), 
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), 
touch me (do me like you're gonna do), 
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

Said you want it, baby (said you want it, baby)
What you gonna do
How you gonna please me
What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
I just want, I want you to
Said you want it, baby
I'm starving here for you, what you gonna feed me
What you wanna do, I want you, I want you

When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), 
touch me (do me like you're gonna do), 
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), 
touch me (do me like you're gonna do), 
touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do)
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you, I want you to touch me
Touch me
I want you to touch me
Touch me

// Ten More Days //

Ten more days under water
And I already know
Iâll be fine
Ten more days til itâs over
Til the darkness goes
And I see the light

Iâm torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til Iâm awake
Ten more days til I donât have to fight
I donât need a future king
There ainât a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and Iâm gonna make it right

You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby Iâm strong enough
To take the tides
The bed, it trembles beneath me
But wherever the road is rough
You know Iâll rise

Iâm torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days til Iâm awake
Ten more days til I donât have to fight
I donât need a future king
There ainât a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and Iâm gonna make it right

// For A Better Day //

Paint on a caution wind
'Neath the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But I'm going on
I'mma keep it strong
I saw your face

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

And we sang our song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day

// Broken Arrows //

You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

Now as you wade through the shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home (home, home)
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

We have to tear down the walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home (home, home)
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes you're losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark

// True Believer //

I wasn't always the brightest, until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never gave me a chance
I might not been the tallest, until I learned how to jump
You got me thinking, love will come around but you, never say I'm the one

If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough

Woah-oh-oh, yeah!

Love will come around

Maybe love will come around, for us

I wasn't always the bravest, they say you only live once
So, you got me thinking, I'm so glad I found you
Life's what you make it so here it comes, it goes
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around if you want it enough

If you're a true believer
If you're a true believer
Love will come around
Lo-lo-love will come around, for us

// City Lights //

City lights, take me away
Now it's time, we never ever head down
Don't be scared, I am for real
Hide away and we will never be found

It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise,
I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

See these lights, we're getting away
Heads won't find us, we're not making a sound
We're not scared, we are for real
Love can't hurt us, now we're sheltered by lies

It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise,
I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breath, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

// Pure Grinding //

Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more
Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more

[Earl St. Clair:]
Started out with nothing and I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much, I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

[Earl St. Clair:]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'

Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more
Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more

[Earl St. Clair:]
Try to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But I ain't understand how the money was spent
My mama told me, "Boy you ain't got no sense
If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"
I've been some places
Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

[Earl St. Clair:]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'

Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more
Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get no more
Working my money 'till I get gold
Monday, Friday mornin'
Working my money 'till I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

// Sunset Jesus //

Try'na set myself up for the win
So people got a dream that so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought to a start and I need a little help with mine

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior, making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

Staring at the billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be any one of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
'Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior, making money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute

Sunset Jesus

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

// Can't Catch Me //

Papa, he was gone tryna make a dime
Mama kept us warm when there was no sunshine
I was busy building up a reputation
Did a lot of things out of desperation
Back up on my feet, got the motivation
Now I found my faith and a good vibration

Search for you, lover, creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the Sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones

Raised in the capital of Port-au-Prince
Born with them pillars in them tenements
Papa used to run from the immigration
When we got to the United Station
A teen under pressure, had to blend in
Before the guitar I had a MAC 10

Search for you, lover, creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the Sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones

// Somewhere In Stockholm //

That's me right there on the corner, listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights hit the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, separate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
These streets are my backbone, until I get back home

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not in the city, but out in the burbs
A river that's dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home
Hemma I Stockholm
DÃ¤r jag hÃ¶r hemma

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

// Trouble //

I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've worn the ring
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter but I ain't learnt a thing

I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last but I've never been first
No, I may not be the best but I'm far from the worst
No, I may not be the best but I'm far from the worst

Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from,
But there's still another million miles to come

I keep on searching for the city of gold
So I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking that maybe it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home

I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
Got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart, but the heart doesn't mind
No, I may not be perfect but I'm loving this life
No, I may not be perfect but I'm loving this life

Oh, I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from,
But there's still another million miles to come

// Gonna Love Ya //

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life but I've been waiting for ya
To twist my dreams and turn my fate
But God I hope it's not too late

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you've had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya like he never could
Cause I know you deserve so good
