// Friend Of Mine //

Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"?
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me about a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine

Hey (hey, hey, hey, hey)
I haven't seen you around since high school (high school)
How you doin', do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
(Guess you're still a friend of mine)
Now I see (I see)
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eye is trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
(That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my)

I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I've been
If you've haven't been a friend of mine

// Lonely Together //

It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time (ooh)
Before the rush to my blood was too much and we flat-lined (ooh)
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed-up and it feels like the first time

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together

My hands are tied, but not tight enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now
A little less lonely now

// You Be Love //

You can be the potter
I'll be the clay
You can be the blacksmith
And I'll be the blade
You can be the poet
And I'll be the song
You can be the sunlight
And I'll be the dawn

You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

I will be your compass
If you'll be my north
I will be your sailor
If you'll be my shore
You can be the gravity
I'll be the fall
You can be my everything
And I'll be your all

You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

If you were heaven I would gladly take my last breath
If you're the edge then I would gladly take the next step
Be the rain
Coming down
Be the flood
Come on take me 'til I, take me 'til I drown
I need you now

You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
You
Be
Love
I will be your lover
(I'll be your lover)
Love you like no other
(I'll be your lover)

You can be the poet
I'll be the song
You can be the sunlight
I'll be the dawn
You can be my everything
I'll be your all

// Without You //

You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

// What Would I Change It To //

Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive

Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

// So Much Better (Avicii Remix) //

I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

'Cause I can do so
Yeah I can do so
Yeah I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

I tried my best that I could do
Just to find out I was never yours
I hang on to the words that you said
And I held out when my world was lost

Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better

Cause I can do so
Yeah, I can do so
Yeah, I can do so much better
I can do so
I can do so
I can do so much better
