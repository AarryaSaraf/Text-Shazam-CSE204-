// Don't Give Up On Us (Enough Is Enough) //

Feel like Iâve been waiting so long for tonight;
Cause I just canât get you out of my mind.
Can you feel my heart beating so fast?
Now youâre hereâno, thereâs no turning back.

Oh, I think Iâm fallingâcanât hold on no more.
Enough is enough, enough is enoughâjust gotta let go.
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine.
No, I never felt, never felt like this before.

Come on babe, donât give up on us.
Choose me and Iâll show you love,
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love.

If you cry, Iâll be there at your side;
If you lost, Iâll be there shining my light.
Cause every touch lifts me up to the stars,
Cause nothing could ever keep us apart.

Oh, I think Iâm fallingâcanât hold on no more.
Enough is enough, enough is enoughâjust gotta let go.
And as my grip unwinds, I feel your hand in mine.
No, I never felt, never felt like this before.

Come on babe, donât give up on us.
Choose me and Iâll show you love,
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love, 
Let me show you love.

// Ease The Pressure //

Dirt on your shoulders
I swear I remember when it changed
Don't you remember
I swear I can see it

You're there with your one eyes smile again
You'll be alright now
If you just let it go
Let it go

I feel the weight around you breaking your bones
Let me make it better (Whoa)
Settle down and let me carry you home
Let me ease the pressure (Oh)

Pull all the blinds down
Just close both your eyes now
Yeah I'll stay
Turn all the lights out and stay awake
And fight off the demons
'Cause you got a heart that'll never take
Yeah, it's alright now
You gotta let it go
Let it go

// Fade Into Darkness //

Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head, I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness

Why worry now? You'll be safe
Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

This world can seem cool and grey
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be okay just keep the faith

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No, we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

// I Could Be The One (Stranger) //

Do you think about me when you're all alone?
The things we used to do, we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you never see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy, can't you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

// Levels //

Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
[x2]

// Lord //

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

That dollar is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

I left my home as a gift to my past
Next to the things I know will never last
I looked for fire but found nothing but ash
Was at my lowest when it hit like a flash

// Malo //

Malo, malo, malo, malo, maloâ¦

Malo, malo, malo eres 
No se daÃ±a a quien se quiere no
Tonto, tonto, tonto eres 
No te pienses mejor que las mujeres
[x4]

Malo, malo, malo, malo, maloâ¦

Malo, malo, malo eres 
No se daÃ±aâ¦

El dÃ­a es gris cuando tu estas
Y el sol vuelve a salir cuando te vas
Y la penita de mi corazÃ³n
Yo me la tengo que tragar con el fogÃ³n

Mi carita de niÃ±a linda 
Se ha ido envejeciendo en el silencio
Cada vez que me dices puta
Se hace tu cerebro mÃ¡s pequeÃ±o

Una vez mas no por favor
Que estoy cansada y no puedo con el corazÃ³n 
Una vez mas no mi amor por favor 
No grites que los niÃ±os duermen. 

Una vez mas no por favor
Que estoy cansada y no puedo con el corazÃ³n 
Una vez mas no mi amor por favor 
No grites que los niÃ±os duermen. 

Voy a volverme como el fuego
Voy a quemar tus puÃ±os de acero 
Y del morao de mis mejillas 
Sacare el valor pa cobrarme las heridas.

Malo, malo, malo eres 
No se daÃ±a a quien se quiere no
Tonto, tonto, tonto eres 
No te pienses mejor que las mujeres 
[x4]

Malo, malo, malo, malo, maloâ¦

Malo, malo, malo eres 
No se daÃ±aâ¦

Malo, malo, malo eres 
No se daÃ±a a quien se quiere no

// No Pleasing A Woman //

I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
That I was so lucky to get her,

I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
I was so lucky that I get her,

Y'know, I, I wanna cry,
I wonder why all the tears are dry,
I just don't dare to show I care,
I got nothin' left to spare,

I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
When nothin' pleases a woman,
There's just no pleasin' a woman,

// Play //

Your whole lifeâs been building up to this moment
Your whole lifeâs been building up to this day
Every dream that moved you
Every scarm improved you
Every voice around you 
Tells you to believe

You can take it to the top
And youâre never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top

The stage is yours to show the world what youâre made of
This is where you rise and reach for the sky
Nothing gonna stop you
Here because you saw through
Anything to keep you
From what you believe

You can take it to the top
And youâre never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top

// Silhouettes //

Press play, fast forward
Nonstop, we have a beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the signs

So we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back at the faded silhouette

Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world knew all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day (that day...)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back, at the faded silhouette

// So Excited //

Iâve been watching you, I like those little moves you makeâ¦
Said Iâm feeling you, Tell me are you feeling me too
Iâd like to know your name but I'm so scared,
Afraid of what you might sayâ¦
But if I don't ever see you again, canât let you just walk awayâ¦

Now youâre approaching me, excuse me can I know your name?
Took the opportunity, and now weâre standing here face to face

Itâs amazing that your so beautiful tell me are you really real
And you say you wanna see me again you have been watchin me too
Iâm so excited excited excited excited!

// Stay With You //

Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know
Is I've looked in New York City
and I've looked in Boston too
I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you

Ain't nobody gonna tell me shit
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know.
Is I've looked in San Francisco
and I've looked all through LA
I've looked in Dallas, Texas
but something didn't feel the same.
So I looked in every city

I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you
Still gonna stay with you

// Superlove //

I want you
All of you
Can we break through?
And start anew?

I want your superlove
I wanna be inside your superlove
I need the spirit with the sexual
I wanna be inside your superlove

We both know
The way to go
Let's take a chance
It's our last dance

// Taste The Feeling //

It feels good, in my heart, in my soul
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end
We can watch the waves, have a Coke
and just sit here beside me
I took a little of my heart again

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing

It feels good as we stand on the shore
And our hearts are jumping
I grab another Coke and let's dive in
Oh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing

So we can feel
Forever you feel
Together be real
Together and

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

With every fading sunset
We see the stars align
We make the simple moments 
Last for a lifetime

So, we'll feel forever
You and me, together
We can stay forever
And be real together

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

You make it easier to sing
You make it easier to sing

// The Days //

Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

Heart ache, heart break
All over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door

And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

Time flew, cut through
All over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together

These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more?

Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store

You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget!

And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

// The Nights //

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my fatherâhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"When thunder clouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"

One day my fatherâhe told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid I heard him say

"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So, live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me

"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me

// The Way It Should //

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life that I've been waiting for the
Push my dreams into my fate
Sometimes I hope it's not too late

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and flew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, 
I wanna love ya, like no one could

// Wake Me Up (Mr. Worldwide Remix) //

[Intro: Pitbull]
Avicii
Mr. Worldwide

Iâve been around the world
And I canât stop hearing this song
Iâve been around the world
And I canât stop hearing this song
And I love it

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
[repeated]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Lifeâs not waiting for a storm
Itâs about dancing in the rain
And if it rains lemons
Learn how to make lemonade
Morale of a story
No problems, just solutions
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have takeoff, Houston
Iâm not them boys that they used to
I got 4 million views collected on YouTube
I grew up around Jesus, coke and thick girls
And that inspired me to be a G note speaker
2 thinks guaranteed, definitely actions
They say the devilâs in the details and I wonât ask this
We got the maker
We got a dream, itâs simple
Live it, wake up

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
[repeated]

[Outro: Aloe Blacc]
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
