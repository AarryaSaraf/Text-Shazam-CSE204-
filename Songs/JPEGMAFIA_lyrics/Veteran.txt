Niggas always wanna get buck 'till they meet 50 Cent
Fuck a subtweet, Sub-Pop niggas heads off like pez
Alt-right want war, well that's fine then
Bitch niggas in the way, well that's common
White boys getting mad cause of my content

You're freaking
You're a flipper
Yeah!
Woah! All kinds of shit

Weed, crack, and dope
(Da-damn, Peggy!)
(I feel fucking terrible)

All I need is rest (Help)
I am uncontested, how can I confess this?
Watch how I finesse (About a hundred bands)
How you so invested, this can't be your best
'Cause, I am not impressed (Baby, I must have fucking stanned)
Bullets through my body, I'm a different shawty
You my favorite mess (Everytime I come around, it's like you dump the bands)
Bitch, I'm never pressed
Keep a fresh Bic, ride down 86, hit!
Roll deep like the kettt
Bitch, I'm (Smoke)
Too fly in the whip, hit!
Fake news, we ain't pressed
Is it safe now? Got my trey pound
In case a bitch wanna test, YEET! (Okay team, follow my command) (YEET!)
Work hard (I'm 'bout to YEET ON THESE NIGGAS!) work, work
(I feel like I'm bout to throw up) (yeet, yeet)

Work hard, twerk hard
26 no kids, yeah (TEARS!)
Talk shit, back it up
No fades, throw shade, whole game
Look a damn mess, aye, fuck the cappin'
Look, no stress, I'm vexed
What the fuck is my appearance? (What's he sayin'?)
I keep a ratchet (I keep a ratchet)
I like 'em YesJulz moaning like a actress (Damn, that's a-)
She got bandits (nah), I'm kinda passive (Right, young)
Young Rich Swann, we gon' cash in (We gon' cash in)
Dust off the ratchets (Ratchet, ratchet)
We got some action (They got some ratch-)
I'm on the main line, I'm tryna catch 'em (Oh! Okay!)

Look, I wish, I wish a nigga would, man
Look, I wish a nigga would try to test me
I wish a nigga would go against me
I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef
Fuck around, end up on a backstreet
And I done cried so many times
Look, man

I wish, whooosh
I wish a nigga would try to test me
I wish a nigga would go get me
I'm a thug, I don't play with no rap beef
Fuck around, end up on backstreet
And I done cried so many times
I done did so many crimes (Don't kill me)
No time, y'all gassed up for the new line, ugh
I'll make a nigga cry at his own pad
I'll make a nigga cry for his dead dad
I'll make a nigga cry for his fat wife
I'll make a nigga cry for...
I'll make a nigga cry for help
I'll make a nigga cry for himself (THUG TEARS!)

// Dayum //

Damn, damn, damn...

// Baby I'm Bleeding //

Let that shit run, ah, fuck!
Alright, alright, alright, shit...
(You think you know me)
Ah, fuck! Uh

Peggy, where you been at? Getting all this promo
When it comes to money, bet these niggas is a no-show
I've been out in Bed-Stuy, chilling with my feet up
Laughing at these SoundCloud niggas trying to be us
When I say us, bet, I don't mean no fucking crew
Peggy been a solo act since Looney Tunes & Goofy Troop
Catch me out in Barksdale, counting fettuccine
While you pussy crackers still trying to pass P.T
Ooh, I'm up in Brownsville, strapped with a Kimber
All you yuppie purses getting swiped like Tinder
Now I'm at the White House, looking for your President
Hop out the van pointing guns at your residence
Ooh, I'm up in Queens now, showing y'all a body
Hoping that you pussy ass [*snare*] try and find me
Chains on my body, looking like a rapper
Acting like a slave when I'm gunning for my masters, nigga

Fuck these niggas!
Buck these niggas!

It's ironic you pressed for a cooking
It's ironic you talk jail time
But you ain't never seen no central booking (yeah)
It's ironic you hang with a nigga that beat women
And have the nerve to call yourself "Girl Pusher" Wow!
You ain't real, I'm gonna show you how I really feel
White boy better put his hands up, I'm ready
And I'm getting Wilder, shoutout to Deontay
Country niggas booming Peggy, I'm the new BeyoncÃ©
Devil on my entrÃ©e, cut like Dante
Promise I will never go blonde like Ka- (hold up!)
Promise I will never go blonde like Kanye?!
Got so many styles, they should call me Peggy A.J
When I hit the stage, niggas know it's a payday
Tell your bitch, come here, like I work for Midway, nigga!
(Fuck!)

... Like fire

// Rock N Roll Is Dead //

Big Daddy Hoffa coming to you here with a kimber
T max 2.45, 1911
This baby oughta be nice right there
Cocked locked and ready to rock!

Gone with the sauce
Got the.45 tucked in the bag
Hit 'em with the hawk
Naw fuck it dawg
Whip 'em with the strap

We've been running up the score
Turnt your house into a home

Ugh

All I do is count the cash
Bitch I'm coming in your house
Let's get freaky with the strap
We don't fuck with alt right
Y'all ain't never been a threat
If y'all come to Baltimore we gon' stick 'em for their racks
We gon' beat them crackers dead
We gon' fuck up on they wife
Take em for a ride
More hits
More life
Tight grip on the chopper
That kickback light
Put hands on a blogger
Make 'em beg for his life

Gone with the sauce
Got the.45 tucked in the bag
Hit 'em with the hawk
Naw fuck it dawg
Whip 'em with the strap
I've been on the fucking road
I just ended rock n roll
We've been running up the score, man

I fuck your baby sitter
I hit her
I took her to a show, man what's the issue
I split her
This groovy nigga bangin' on your sister
No kicker

How many cars does it take
To make this shit an easy race
How many cars does it take
To make this fucking pain go away

Truth!

// Panic Emoji //

Yesterday I thought I was having a heart attack
Panic Attack
Made a wack beat yesterday
I get ideas in my
I keep smoking weed
And I masturbate constantly

Keep hustling
Keep moving
I'm a nuisance
I'm useless
We fucked
This hurts

I'm a nuisance
DOA to the base
Face wet, legs shake
Grab my chest, feeling faint
These symptoms, can't help them
Where my health went
This hurts

Crackers keep calling me Aces
I put the spade on hook
All of you yuppies is pussy
You ain't never hit a jugg
Ain't no money on your books
I put Lemmy in the grave
I push the golden gun up on ya braids
Pew! Fade

And I'm getting cash you ain't never there, oooh, yeah
Oh, you fucking mad, 'cause I'm counting swag, oooh, yeah
Nigga, you's a bitch, you's a fucking hoe, oooh, yeah
I can't tell you
Pull up on 'em with the stick talk
Nigga you ain't bout that brick talk
Fuck with me you get shot
Shoo, shoo
I am a thot
Fuck it
I am a opp
Wrist cut, wrist cut, wrist cut
Grey death on the block

It's really just a panic attack...

// DJ Snitch Bitch Interlude //

Hulk hogan known to keep the thang smokin'
Steady fuckin' with a blonde I think I'm Frank Ocea-
(DJ Snitch Bitch)
Be still...
I can't deal with all these sudden motions
Mac high as Sierra
Your updates is frozen
Crouching in the bushes
Like I'm jailposing
That 38 special team
I don't need coaching
You are not a man bitch
You're a fucking token
Giuliani suck a dick
That's the fucking slogan
Black market shawty
Keep the thang on me
Blood on my money
But ain't a stain on me
Ridge racer
No games for me
New money new habits
Make you disappear with no trace that's tragic
Riding down Calvert in a caddy with the ratchet
Pussy call the cops so much
The cops should give him badges
Hold up let me hear that back?

Alright!

// Whole Foods //

Bitch I shop Whole Foods like I'm booooujie!
Pass the blunt, my mind is missing
Tweet my shit I need the mentions
Stop pretending
Look!

Riding round the city
Like a side bitch
Hermit till I die
Close the blinds bitch
Momma told me baby you's a prophet
So profit
And treat these fucking labels like a side - hold up
Fuck it dog had do it
Reviewers looking stupid
Stick to music
I'm am the Black God
Fuck a human
Stanley Kubrick
You know the rapping shit be therapeutic
Pitchfork told me to never be abusive
Unless I'm moving units
I see what the truth is
'Cause niggas preaching bout the pussy be the biggest douches
Wow

I'm out the window looking real stupid
Fuck that
It's young Sully
How I peep the ruins
Trust that
I whip the whip like the shit been boosted
My bus pass
Ain't been legit
Since I smashed Karrueche (not true)
These people thinking that they warriors
They straight kabuki
I hit your momma with Conker's Bad Fur Day
Goldeneye hit em up
Perfect Dark nigga for the job so I zip em up
And put em in a bag
Like I'm picking up dog shit

// Macaulay Culkin //

I got my hands on my face like Macaulay Culkin
Gave her the cig, but I let the smoke in
And it's the same dude
Black pants, brown boots, chest open
I traveled down the road and back again
My girls golden
Black man, white fam
I feel like Jason Jordan
I play my albums front to back and make it feel important
Apply compression when I spit so it don't get distorted
Piper Chap
With the strap
Fuck the talk
Get the warden
I think I'm Rick and Morty
In the lab I take precaution
Snipe 'em out
Burn the body
Stash the Glock
Buy the coffin (Nasty)
Just for me
Yo style is my custody
Man I should charge a shipping fee
These rappers don't mean shit to me
2 guns, Mulder and Scully, I'm solving mysteries
Feminist, pistol whip your wife first, that's chivalry
Sounding like my minimes
But you ain't got the heart to do these evil deeds
Debra pack
Turn Stone Cold into Simple Steve
Where it at
Slap a nigga up
Then I get the cream
5 buck, 6 cookies
Sounding like a deal to me
Yo shit don't appeal to me
My fans going heel for me
Gots to keep it real for me
Shouldn't even be on no bills with me
These punk niggas be killing me
That wack shit ain't trill to me
Fuck y'all niggas, I take the heat
Don shit

Selling art to these yuppies
Getting mixed offers

Wrote a 16 then I tossed it
If I wanted bullshit

Young rick murder

I'm a slave to this rap shit I can't quit (No)
Fresh cig with the grip
A yuppie pop shit

When the spears come out

You yuppies ain't real
Let you live for a fee
We taking Brooklyn back
You can leave the coffee
And you coons dying to
Word to Charles Barkley (Word)
My head dreaded up like my name mar...
Naw we don't do that
Simple rhyming ass niggas
Get they wig pushed back
Get your mic snatched
Nicotine patched
Call my white boys up
Get your life hacked
Heard your Stock dropped
Nigga this the blow back
Put the Hawkeyes on him
Heard he like M*A*S*H
You gon' rust in peace
Heard you like thrash
Put a price on your head
That's a light bag
45 on me like mike back
Whoa

Hey! Alright!
Baby I'm just heating up
I just wonder is it for you
Feelings stuck
You know how to heat me up
Ice it up
Ice it like a hockey puck
Baby I'm just heating up...
You know how to heat me up...

Deep off in the main...
Hidden hills

I walk in the booth like I own it

Y'all niggas ya'll built like rats ahhh

You ain't even gotta look at them

4chan on my dick cause I'm edgy
Sit ya pale ass down, have a Pepsi [*sip*]

Feel the dab in my chest, this is venting
Now maybe I'm s-
