// BALD! //

Yeah
Fuck that, whoa, uh

Fuck that bitch, I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switch hands
Block the witness, take the stand
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace (Word)
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front? I'm callous
Bald (Ha)
I look like Ray Allen (Real)
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Yo' files is not a challenge (Nah)
Boy, you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald (Dwayne Wade)

Uh, look, I'm cashin' out
Young Darby I'm taggin' in
They gon' bring your casket out
I hope that you fit in it (Ooh)
What you doin', babe?
How you get caught with no Gat? (Yeah, yeah)
You niggas must got no pride
Peggy gon' give you no slack, for real
'Cause you pussy

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Keep my business off the 'Gram
Switch my style like I switch hands
Goin' to war on foreign land
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace
Wait, uh
I can't treat niggas like big deals (Yeah)
These toys don't come with no kid's meal
Been there, done that, done seen it
Not my girl but I fuck her like she is
They be fuckin' up my lyrics on Genius
And these pussy ass critics repeat it
Been the same since Even Stevens
Y'all niggas switch like the seasons (Facts)
Y'all lives ain't got no meanin' (Why)
And them deals ain't got no freedom
I can't just loop it leave and it
Gotta smack it up, rip it up, and eat it (Yeah, ha)
You can't feed your kid 'cause
You spent that shit on your car (You broke)
Tape my hands, I'm going over squares' heads like a VCR (Ha)

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Yeah
Fuck that, whoa, uh

Fuck that bitch, I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switch hands
Block the witness, take the stand
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace (Word)
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front? I'm callous
Bald (Ha)
I look like Ray Allen (Real)
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Yo' files is not a challenge (Nah)
Boy, you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance

[Denzel Curry:]
Yeah
My life was written already so I was gifted already
And with this God-given talent I knew the Devil been met me
Can't compare me to Jesus because he ain't Noah's father
He told me, "Please, be still and see that steel is revolver" (You right)
'Cause in my hood, these niggas poppin' mollies and shootin'
I'm stressed the fuck out, that's why I must commence to get zooted
I'm trapped in my head, between the thoughts of health and my wealth
Right next to bein' selfish and just bein' myself
The fast spitter, slash, clash, ghetto pass, sinner sippin' bad liquor
It's the nigga you may know, I'm the GOAT
To them clout chasers and them 'bout whatevers and them wave riders
Told them that my life is not a boat, you can't float (You right)
Call me Zeltron when I'm rappin', call me Denzel when we fuck, ho
You're allowed to touch me but I don't wanna keep in touch, though (Wow)
Say I'm livin' comfortable because I'm makin' much dough
But I wasn't happy, cut my hair and let the sluts go
Ever so softly, suicide has cost me
Did I lose my mind? I feel my head been lost me
Been a couple years and haven't spoken to Lofty
Haven't seen the family, only been with the posse (Skrr)
Couple gold plaques, scratch that off a gold list
Cold shit is gettin' diamond plaques by stayin' focused (Yuh)
No whip, I won't let 'em do me like Jahseh (Yuh)
My mama say that I should pray 'cause demon comes in different shapes (Okay)
Got that Stray Rats on my body 'cause Maurice don't fuck with BAPE (What?)
All these bars that I be writin' make it hard for you to relate (Damn)
Hesitate, I rarely do when fuckin' these hoes I barely knew
Overturnin', startin' new, can't act like a jit by thirty-two
I'm twenty-five, though, dreadlocks had your boy like Sideshow Bob
Can't complain about too much because I'm on my job
Switch my look, I got 'em hooked, they call me Young Heartthrob
I am (Bald!)

// CUTIE PIE! //

Keep filmin' no matter what
Let's go
Yeah, yeah

Whole time I got the vice grip (Yeah)
Triggers bustin', niggas duckin', I got the right clip
Good manners or the damage, a nigga might tip
I drive the boat for the passengers
This a Kodak moment, a nigga might drift
I work smarter not harder, this is a life tip
Can't get your show on the road, niggas need a pilot (Uh)
You niggas trash still slavin' away on Sylenth
Matter of fact you slaves no matter who niggas sign with (Uh)
Lemme look at your deal, 21 Savage
To these Milli Vanillie ass niggas
Don't even own what they rhymin' (Facts)

I can't take this livin' all alone, I'm Phyllis Hyman
Billie Eilish got four GRAMMYs, it's frightenin'
Slick old nigga, I'm Peabo Bryson
Flows be so-so, you off key
Rappin' like it's '04, wrote this in Red Monkeys

Uh
Steady hand Peggy, my production is a diamond
Precision, execution, and timin', slick rhymin'
Pick up the pattern, tackle melodies like a lineman (Huh)
Rappin' offsides, throw the flag when you fine him
Up in your turf with a bomb and a plan
Flowin' in enemy territory, I feel like Walt White
Teach you niggas how to get busy on USB mics
Rappin' like Schoolly D and dressing like Magnum P.I
She need a tip drill, Peggy been uncut since E.I
All these amatuers, they can't keep up with my stamina (Nope)
Ebony, wrong category
You ain't built for what you backin' up
Make yo bitch back it up
All these weirds beats, you commentin' while I'm stackin' up
Gots to find new wave, these niggas stay attackin' us
Feel like a Titan when I'm strappin' up, my flow a bachelor
Get to fuckin' on the back of her and get attached to her
Pistol pokin', I look after her, your beats inaccurate
Muddy low end and you over-compressin'
'Cause you don't know what you doin', so you be stackin' it
Don't know the difference between threshold and attackin' it
You impassionate, ungrateful
Mince meat, don't mince words, bitch I hate you
Thinkin' about what I'ma do and how I'ma do it when I face you

Oh, man
