// Hop Out the Pussy I'm 21 //

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Momma told me I'm too cool to be young
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm Jesus
Black savior with a Caesar
I traveled the world with no Visa
Kissin' white ass like Koreans
Young Leonard every season
I'm always on defense
Now hop out that pussy I'm 21
License to kill with a dirty gun
My girl said only I make her cum
Told her ex man the same shit
Playing cards like Gambit
Wolverine claws out in Hampden
Cops come niggas scramblin'
Peggy stand still like a mannequin, nigga

[Freaky:]
On wax
It go wiki, wiki, wiki on the track
You can't see me like Houdini
Who he to me?
Do I Dijonay?
Just Sticky like I'm hangin' with Penny Proud
Look at me
Ow, popped out the pussy
23 year old child
Split the Dutch like Moses split the Nile
That was then, this is now
Wet Willy gone digital
Don't ask me how
Actually child, sit your ass down

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm
Hop out that pussy I'm 21, 21
Hop out that, uh
Hop out that pussy I'm 21
Hop out that pussy I'm
Hop out that pussy I'm 21, 21
Hop out that, uh

Bitch, I am not with the fuck shit
I bring the dope to your function
I bring the dope to your momma house
Just to show you I ain't frontin'
Neptunes with the drum hits
MF DOOM with the sample flips
Peggy should have his own drum kit
Peggy should have his own ooh
I deny my identity like I was Bill Maher
Cause I steal cars and drive across the country looking for niggas to kill off
I'm not the one
I'm just a spark in the Sun and I'm blocking your moonlight
Cause I'm so bright, and I'm so hard, and I'm such a bitch
Niggas scratching for shit while my finger itch
Trigger glitching in the system, The Matrix
I play for Pistons, this a defensive year
Ask about me, I don't care
Ask about me, I ain't there
Snitches are pawns
Make 'em get off of my lawn
Tie 'em up and hit the river at dawn
Make 'em learn every last word to this song
Hop out pussy, that oh shit 21

[Verse 4 - Freaky:]
Hopped out the pussy I'm 21
Learned how to walk 20 som'
Fresh out of prison I'm 40
I ain't got shit, I ain't worthy
They tryin' retire my jersey
They wanna do the boy dirty
They wanna give me a purpose
They monetize feelin' worthless
They cut me out of the surplus
The fuck did I do to deserve this?
I'm on foreign land and deserted
Run for your lives, you heard me
Run for your life, you heard me
Mobility's life, you heard me
Mobility's life, you heard me
I'm in a foreign institute
I heard the warden drive a coupé
I'm in a fuckin' chicken coop
It's like 10 by fuckin' 2"
Hop out the pussy I'm 21
License to kill with dirty gun

"We hear so much about the slavery. 300 years ago our grandfathers were slaves or 200 years ago our grandfathers were slaves. Oh for God sakes, did we have anything to do with that? I have no part in it. I have no slaves. Are they blaming us for what happened 3 years ago? Let's forget the past! Think of the future, build up the future and why keep hemming and hawing over the same thing over and over and over again and they say, 'You must give me land because my grandfather was a slave! ' Well then, I would say, 'For God sakes, find the man who had your grandfather as a slave and then demand the land from him.' Don't bother me because I had no part of it."

[Freaky:]
Xanned out, pissed off
Plan out, think squad
Drag out, big balls
Pass out, big gas
Chuh-chang, with that
Get back, stink pack
6 zips, 1 liter
Drank that
Picture perfect, paint that
All black, bald cap
Call back, ASAP
Where your racks?, lay flat
Payback, roll up
Haystack, made that
50 Xans, 25 dollars
Fade that
Real racks, wood grain
Maybach, I want that
Moved to Baltimore
I ain't gone back
Sold smack, no stacks
Can't lose focus
Fuck all y'all orgy
Listening to N.O.R.E
2 liter pouring
You people boring
Sippin' on the Jordan
Wake up from the dead
Like 4-5, I'm back
All your shit is horse shit
Stay rollin' Lotus
I'm off several doses
I'm super-freaky-llama-expialidocious
Oh shit
Makin' no sense
Fuego

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Squad autonomous
Shooters anonymous
Women androgynous
We do the opposite
Peggy so dominant
Stay with one pistol like
Bitch I'm monogamous
Married to opulence
Fuck your accomplishments
Prenup my documents
Sign 'em with confidence
Fuck all the consequence
Need a Janelle Monae
So I can I can start my metropolis
These bitches incompetent
Weapons with silencers
Now killed or be killed
Decision unanimous
Not with the indie shit
No Titus Andronicus
More like Tidus up in Zanarkand
Banging Yuna and her guardians
High summon
Bringing calm again
Sinners need not to prey for Peggy
Wash you niggas cause my load is heavy
Baby fro but my spirit dreaded
When I crack the code
Watch you get embedded

"Um, final question in this poll: 30% of Americans, only 30%, see Hilary Clinton as being honest and trustworthy but 34% only see you as being honest and trustworthy. Again, are you gonna tell a message that might get that number up?" "Um, I'm honest, I'm trustworthy, I tell it like it is, I'm here, I didn't need to do this, I'm enjoying it, but I'm enjoying it because we're going to make America great again. We are going to make America great again. We're also going to make America safe again, Bill"

I might vote for Donald Trump, just to say I did it
I might blindly fall into a group of friends full of bigots (REAL TRAP SHIT) Y'all don't know my aiming
I got a vision like That's So Raven (damn)
Gangstas don't die, they get fat and move to Miami
I AM HE, throw it my way, INT
Everything straight like ironed T's
In the back of the Bell burning my degree (LLAMA)
At Uni Mart yelling, "Fuck Bernie"
Up early, cup dirty, couple thirties
Boy the way that Sprite, mix with the lean so purrty
Shit, my tolerance is no mercy (damn)
I just popped 20 xan's so the crackers wouldn't find them
Back up to the wall though drugs like "Where's Waldo?"
Wrote it down, Gonzo knows see I chanchó mano a mano
Damn bro, de plano (aye, aye) ferragamo llama sittin' on chanclas
Deuce feed a Fanta or Mylanta (DAMN SON WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?)
I just might vote for Donald Trump just cause it's legal (adios mio)

[Donald Trump and JPEGMAFIA:]
"-We have gang, gangs, their coming in from all over-"

(You... you think you know me...)

[JPEGMAFIA:]

I might call the IRS, pay them a visit (damn, Peggy)
Feed all my niggas with pistols and privilege them digits (ay dios mios, Peggy)

I don't think y'all understand but I'm tryna bring back the south (DAMN SON)
I've been the man for a year (what else?)
You've been a bitch all your life (what happened?)
I got my hand on the crown, yeah, voted for that nigga twice (two times)
Braindead on my birthday, I voted for that nigga high (high)
Fuck a Jordan and a Huckabee (fuck 'em), I never wanted the mic (yo)

Trust me

I had to hit the marksmen
To make out of basic
All my bitch niggas know what I'm talking about
I had to take it back to '05 and walk it out
Why every woke song you niggas make
You be shitting on yourselves?
Pathetic, somebody gotta be Ice Cube and dead it
Now if I said it I meant it
You run this verse back enough times u get infected
I got the antiseptic
I dropped BBC three months ago
And haven't heard shit that I'm impressed with
So fuck it, imma press this
That good shit you got
The one you keep in a secret folder
And stay trying to flex with
Ain't fucking with my next shit
Shout out to my nigga Micah Johnson down in Texas
He fucked them cops good I can't wait for the next hit
Hit after hit after hit after hit
Since you crackers loves stats and percentages
I got a fresh one for you and it goes like this:
Every last cop that died in Dallas can suck a dick
In the afterlife
And if a war comes I'm shooting husbands after wives
They don't want me in the suburbs
Giving your girl that good wood, cracker
She said I'm suberp, superb like no other
I grip that ass tight when I'm doggystyling your mother
She keep throwing it back imma give u some tanned brothers
I'll be damned if I hold hands with a cop like he my cousin
You rock a blue uniform then? Peggy don't see color
But I ain't trying to get smothered
I just wanna bust a nut in her
Plan B Peggy such a sinner
I want that John Oliver, Bill Maher, real sex, HBO Go money, nigga

Fuck out my lane
Driving these vultures the fuck out the game
The fuck is he saying?
I got a million special moves
That I call upon like the Pokémon game
That's fucking bat shit
Sleeping with so many lies in my mattress
Getting head like Petraeus
Not getting caught like Hernandez
Then I go to court in my pajamas
I might take a MARC train to my lawyer's house
So I can in get in her panties
She hop out the bed
I pull out my meds
And told her I'm voting for Sanchez
I mean Pedro, I'm a bastard
For them pesos get yo' ass kicked
Hop out the bed and turn my swag on, pimpin'
U got a lot to say but you ain't really saying shit like Ashlee Simpson
I stomp on every Kirk Franklin track that I come across
Just to get my point across
That's a line you never cross
I was in them project halls while you was in a fucking loft
My passion for Christ became a passion for MIDI's and DAW's
Reasons for regrets and loss
Fruity niggas acting soft
Hit 'em with that 808 boom
Take your high end off
Jesus was a carpenter
Malcolm was a boss, Ghandi was a pussy
He'll catch a bullet like Randy Moss
Word to my niggas in Pike County
I'm going off

"Oooh aahhh the coppers in the attic"

If it don't come to me
Don't force it
If it ain't it write itself
He ain't wrote it
If it weren't for the drugs
He'd lose focus
Lately I been feelin' like I am not a rapper
Being behind this mic ain't makin' shit happen
Tryna get to the root of my words
Fuck Greek or Latin
I ain't got shit to say
Like Charlie Chaplin
Clutching the only dollar in my pocket
Tryna not rob some fuckin' body
Wake up nauseated
Cause I been going to sleep hungry
Only thing I own is a pile of fuckin' undies
They tryna pull the rug from under me
Old me askin' questions bout the younger me
Like, "Why's he rappin'?"
XYZ plannin'
That's why they ran in
It's never random
The shorty keeps his pants on
All's I need is a dag gon' slice to land on
I don't need a fake patoi
At the end of the movie like ha, ha
Off in the sunset I go
Like can I kick it
Thai bow
What type bull shit you on?
It's Freaky

"Oooh aahhh the coppers in the attic"

I got no head on me
Niggas ain't ain't ahead of me
Hit your wifey doggystyle
My special move the pedigree
I'm Stone Cold with this recipe
I cook these niggas breakfast, B
Llama like spit like Tempa T
How dare these niggas step to me
Fuck them cause they not my team
Hella dollars no receipts
All that cake up on her face
Like damn maybe its Mayballine
All this talk about my race
I brush that shit off gracefully
Short stroking niggas from the burbs got so much hate for me (FINISH HIM)
First you was a rapper then you was trapper
Then you was punk kid
I guess you just an actor
Niggas getting mixed up in some shit they never mastered
I don't give a fuck Mo or your gramma
Scrapers tryna buck
They getting dragged by they antlers
I ain't talking labor
When I say I got the hammer
(Reversed) saying that he's knows me
Not true
The papers said I can't hit (bleep) nigga, not you
Niggas want war but filing orders for peace (beep)
I'm running with the squad
While you run to police (beep)
Acting out on Twitter just gon' get you deceased (beep)
While I smoke your daddy's ashes
Out my Fasfa receipts (nigga)

[Freaky:]
On the mic
Make you think twice
On stage you think it's a magic mic
Way I take layers off
I'm from where the moon and water came from
Build relations to the sun
Wake up smell the concrete when the rains done
Hungry but I need Ganja before bacon
Give my girl that brown sugar
I'm Sanaa Lathan (FINISH HIM)
I got shit say, Nathan
Just know that style is ancient
Wise men told me
Never get your hopes up for Pitchfork
I make sure to scratch and sniff my ass around rich folk
Separate the white from the egg yolk
Kush and orange juice over French toast
Been a goat
10 4
Down the rabbit hole with Draino
If you ain't know
On the mic most you no Bueno
I been spittin' pukin' on myself since a day one
Chewing on my favorite color crayon
Free Desean
"Prepare to die"

[Freaky:]
2 Perc 15s weighing down my mind
Hoping the spirits don't run when they come for me
Don't ask me what the fuck's on my mind
I slip and I slip
I'm slipping like I'm on ice
All I do is dynamite
I want to be on your screen like we're on Skype
Sometimes I dress and look like a dyke
I drip and I drip
Dripping the drip, alright
Kidnap DJ
For a knee slap and cheesecake
For Pete sake's, dude
Paint nudes of Saint Jude
For crew cuts, beefcakes in blue
Pull up to Chipotle like
"Why's a white man making my food? Come on, dude..."
No, fuck that
I ain't Sammy Davis Jr
I won't smile and face the viewer like I'm Judas
For 30 pieces of little silver
I'd much rather sell my liver
Than be sold down the river
On the road we all begin on but we act like we don't know like a bigot
Let me know if you dig it
2-4-0 is the digits
It's Freaky (LLAMA)

[Hemlock Ernst:]
I took my face out the box with the windows rattling
Sabbath in the month of July
I caught a wave blown bare back stares down the barrel of a bullet traveling
Take me back to death
My soul's javelin
He made me in his image?
I take a screen capture with the grimace
Sentenced myself to social media dependence
No friends and no gimmicks
So fuck a million dollars
And fuck your million follows
Imma be a man with no tomorrow
'Til the fire runs out
I'll be just another outline in the chalk
When my time runs out
Or just old and bloated
That's how white tends to do this
Stupid fucking country never learn to face the music
Put in on your pages never say it to their faces
What's this freedom with no means of education?
For racists
My ancestor's slavers
My ancestor's neighbors
A plantation nation
We're all slaves in relation
Underlying backbone
Crosses burned on country backroads
No charge for broken backbones
Hillbilly's bumping Big Pun
Battle square a telling sign
We know your hateful asses blind
If that's called free speech
Then set me on fire
Set me on fire, let me be free one time
Set me on fire, let me be free one time
Set me on fire, let me be free one time
Set me on fire, let me be free one time, won't you?

[JPEGMAFIA:]
I got a bunch of shit on my mind
I did my thing with these girls and they stalking me
So many things weighing down my mind
I can't believe you talk to me
My name is Peggy
I think I'm perfect
And I spit harder
Than Degrassi workers
I come from the projects where bitches get tossed at
And most of my friends are either dead
Or they tryna rap
And that shit makes me sad
I wish they had a father
I mean I have a dad
But that nigga never bothered
Now I'm not trying to whine
Just gotta get these bars up
Rapping since the teen ages
Niggas never gave a fuck
But now that I've been on these blogs
These niggas want a handout
Imma make 'em work for this cheese
Cake like the band now
Mix this, master that
My nigga, get your bands out
Stand down, Peggy got more styles than Sandow
"Ooh, I love your tape!"
I guess that's the saying now
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me who's a fan now
Ay, you can't play me like a coon
I ain't foolish nigga
And I'm smart with this money
I'm Jewish nigga
Hungry for this rap shit
My flow's screaming, "bite me"
4chan talking smack
That shit excites me
Now you don't like me, huh?
You wanna fight me?
You gon' swing?
Then just do it, nigga
Oh, you ain't Nike

"I'm totally fine now. Sorry about that. Yeah, listen, it's not really to make up for earlier but, how about we try that dating thing again?"
"Yes, great. That sounds awesome. It'll be your choice mine is all [?]. Haha, okay, okay, you're on. See you tomorrow"
(Sorry about that)
(Yeah)
(Sorry about that)
(Yeah)
"Revolutionists and racists believe that the masses have to be lead. Most Americans believe that the people lead. You have heard the people speak. There is commonality, there is hope, and there is still time. It is not yet five minutes to midnight but it is clearly late in the day. Goodnight"
