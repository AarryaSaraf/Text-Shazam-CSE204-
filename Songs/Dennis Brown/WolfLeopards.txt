Album: WolfLeopards

// Created By The Father //

Look at the trees; how their leaves are blowing away in the sky
Listen to the birds; how they're singing away their time
Look at the sun; how it shines bright in the sky
All these things were created by the father
Look at the grass; how it make your lawns look pretty
Look at the flowers; how it make your gardens look pretty too
Even when you're feelin' weary, tired and low
All you've got to do is
Relax and feel the cool wind blow

Uh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh, woah, yeah
What a beautiful seeing (Uh)

Look at the trees; how their leaves are blowing away in the sky
Listen to the birds; how they're singing away their time
Look at the sun; how it shines bright in the sky
All these things were created by the father
Look at the grass; how it make your lawns look pretty
Look at the flowers; how it make your gardens look pretty too
Even when you're feelin' weary, tired and low
All you've got to do is
Relax and feel the cool wind blow

What a beautiful seeing (Yeah)

// Wolves And Leopards //

Come along yeah and dig my song

Too much wagonist
Too much antagonist

Wolves and Leopards
Are trying to kill the sheep and the shepards [x2]

Too much informers
Too much talebearers [x2]

Wolves and Leopards
Are trying to kill the sheep and the shepards [x2]

Too much watch and peep
Its time the wolves dem leave the sheep [x2]

Wolves and Leopards
Are trying to kill the sheep and the shepards [x3]

// Emmanuel //

The lord God he is with us, yes
He gave us the moon
And the stars and his blessing
No regrets, no sorrow, nor pain, no no
Oh Jacob, he recalls the name

My people don't be misled
Come along
My people think wise instead
Children
My people don't be misled
My people think wise instead

Here we are singing and dancing
Together like one family
We all know, we all know
We all know what it is to be free
Lets all sing and [?] enmity, no no

My people don't be misled
Come along
My people think wise instead
Children
My people don't be misled
My people think wise instead
...

// Here I Come //

Love and hate can never be friends
Oh no, oh no

Here I come with love and not hatred
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow I
All the days of I life

Envy no one, no wish to be with no evil man
For there'll come the day
When you'll be whipped by the father's hand

Live up roots children
Live up rasta children

My head is anointed and my cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow I, all the days of I life

// Rain From The Sky (Rolling Down) //

Said it's rolling down, rolling down my cheek, yeah
It's rolling down, rolling down my cheek, yeah

Ever since you went away
Every day, is just a cloudy day
And I don't know, if it's rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

Hurry back, and bring the sun out
And let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

All I know is I love you, and if I live forever
I'll be laughing, you're still here
You will always be just, everything to me

So, hurry back, and bring the sun out
Let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

All I know is I love you, and if I live forever
I'll be laughing, you're still here
You will always be just, everything to me

So, hurry back, and bring the sun out
Let me be, your, one and only one
With just one kiss, stop the rain from the skies
Or tears from my eyes, falling onto my face
And rolling down my cheek

// Boasting //

Yes, your boasting
Can only be, for a time, yeah
Whoa oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh - yeah

Your boasting, can only be for a time
Yes, you're boasting, but you'll never survive, no
'Cause today you are up and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me, yeah

So what's the use in
Pretending to your brother
That you'll love him
And behind you're trying to kill them, yes
Gotta wake up, gotta, you gotta wake up to reality

...
Yeah, yeah - whoa, whoa, whoa, well, yeah, now
Ooh, yeah

I said your boasting, can only be for a time
Yes, you're boasting, but you'll never survive no
'Cause today you are up and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me, yeah

So what's the use in
Pretending to your brother, yeah
That you'll love him
And behind you're trying to kill them, yes
Gotta wake up, gotta, you gotta wake up to reality
'Cause you're boasting, but you'll never survive, no, no, no

'Cause today you are up, yeah and tomorrow you're down
Today for you and tomorrow for me..

// Lately Girl //

Lately girl I've been watching you all right
I don't know why I think of you every night
Please girl what is it that I see in you
That suits me so, yeah
I'd really like to know

I pray and I am hoping well
I'll take you by your hand
And lead you to the promised land far away

I take you to the promised land far away
Don't you know...

// By The Foot Of The Mountain //

Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-do-uh, uh-uh, hu-hu-hu

By the foot of a mountain lives an old man
Who sits all day and hopes things will come his way
And the first time ever I passed by his way
He called me, "Son, come on over here"
He said, "Although you may not know me
But deep down, something tells me
That you're just going astray
So, relax here and hope love will pass your way"

Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-do-uh, uh-uh, hu-hu-hu
Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-uh-uh-uh-uh
Do-do-uh-uh, uh-uh, hu-hu-hu

Though I try to live good among by brethren
They always act as if they can't accept it
And so now I'm tired of being treated this way
I've got to return where I know love will pass my way
So, when I reach home I shall sing a song
Of love to you

To you, to you
To you-uh-uh-uh
