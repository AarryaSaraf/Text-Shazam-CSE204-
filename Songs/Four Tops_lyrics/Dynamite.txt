// It's Impossible //

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry 
It's just impossible

Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you going through me
Split the second hat I never think of you
Oh, how impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

And tomorrow
Should you ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it
I would sell my very soul and not regret it
For to live without your love
It's just impossible
Impossible, mmm
Impossible

// The Bigger You Love (The Harder You Fall) //

When you love someone dear,
They can do no wrong
But when you love too hard, girl
You sing a different song
You got to take your time and build only slow
And get it all together, child, and watch it grow

The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly

You gotta start a love right from the ground
'Cause when you start from the top, girl
You can only come down
And when you give all your love and get no return
That's the hurting way you have to try to learn

The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly
The bigger you love, the harder you fall
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start small
Oh, the bigger you love, the harder you fall 
Take it from me, girl, you gotta start softly

// Love The One You're With //

If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slip away
Because your baby is so far away

Well, there's a rose in the fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Don't be angry, don't be sad
And don't sit crying over good times you had
There's a girl right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do

And there's a rose in the fisted glove
And eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Do, do, do...

Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Turn your heartache right into joy
She's a girl and you're a boy
Get it together, make it nice
Ain't gonna need any more advice

And there's a rose in the fisted glove
And eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with

Do, do, do...

// Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By //

Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
But at last you'll find out that don't compare
To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
Oh baby, let's do it today
Inflection
Give us protection

Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
That's what we've got

Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
Oh, oh, it ain't easy

// If //

If a picture paints a thousand words
Then why can't I paint you?
The words will never show 
The you I've come to know

If a face could launch a thousand ships
Then where am I to go?
There's no one home but you
You're all that's left me too
And when my love for life is running dry
You come and pour yourself on me

If a man could be two places at one time
I'd be with you
Tomorrow and today
Beside you all the way

If the world should stop revolving
Spinning slowly down to die
I'd spend the end with you
And when the world was through
Then one by one the stars would all go out
Then you and I would simply fly away

// If I Could Build My Whole World Around You //

If I could build my whole world around you, darlin'
First I'd put heaven by your side
Pretty flowers would grow wherever you walk, honey
And over your head would be the bluest sky
And I'd take every drop of rain
And wash all your troubles away
I'd have the whole world built around you
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

If I could build my whole world around you
I'd make your eyes the morning sun
I'd put so much love where there is sorrow
I'd put joy where there's never been love
And I'd give my love to you
To keep for the rest of your life
And happiness would surely be ours
And that would be all right, oh yes it would

Doo doo doo doo...

Oh, if I could build my whole world around you
I'd give you the greatest gift any woman could possess
And I'd step into this world you've created
And give you true love and tenderness
And there'd be something new with every tomorrow
To make this world better as days go by

If I could build my whole world around you
If I could build my whole world around you
Then that would be all right, oh yeah

// Don't Let Me Lose This Dream //

If I lose this dream
I don't know what I'm gonna do
If I lose this dream
I'm dreaming about for me and you

If it goes away
I might as well hang it up
'Cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind
To make it true
Or help it grow
And I only know, I only know, I only know

If I lose this dream
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes
You're the one I need
I don't want a love
That's second best
There've been all of my life
I wanted to do
That made me blue

Help me hold onto this dream
For sometimes dreams often come true
And they all come true, they all come true
For me and you
Wait a minute baby

Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me lose my dream, no
Baby, baby be strong

You say that a-you believe that what I say is true
And that I'm the one and only girl for you
Just tell me
That no matter what the people say
You're in my corner all the way
And I won't lose this dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me lose my dream, no
Baby, baby be strong

Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me lose, lose my dream
Baby, baby hold on
Don't let me, ooh baby

// Do You Love Me Just A Little, Honey //

Oh yeah

Do you love me just a little, honey? 
Oh yeah (oh yeah, ooh, ooh) 
My uncertain heart has to know, oh, oh (oh, oh) 
Tell me now (tell me now, tell me now) 
Before I let myself go, boy (let myself go) 
Do you love me? (Do you, do you, do you love me?) 
I've gotta know, oh 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, oh honey

Oh... do you care a little for me, sweetheart? 
Uh-huh (oh yeah, ooh, ooh) 
Or do you plan for us to part? Oh yeah 
Tell me now (tell me now) 
Baby, baby before it's too late, girl (before it's too late) 
Oh, should I, should I go, mama? 
Or should I stay? Oh 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, oh honey

Oh love, oh love can be a many splendid thing 
Oh what joy, what joy true love can bring 
Oh, and because I want, oh 
I really want a love that's real (want a love that's real) 
Oh honey, I just got to know, oh, just how you feel 
Oh, tell me, baby

Tell me, tell me, tell me should I get ready for a heartbreak? 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 
Or tell me what I saw if I had to wait, yeah 
Tell me now (tell me now, tell me now) 
Oh, am I loving you in vain? (loving you in vain) 
Oh, and if I love you too much more, honey 
Well, I have nothing to gain 
Oh, tell me now 
Honey, honey, honey 
Honey, honey, honey, honey

I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey 
Hey, hey, hey 
I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey 
Ooh, hey.. baby, baby 
I declare I love you 
I wanna know do you love me, too, honey
