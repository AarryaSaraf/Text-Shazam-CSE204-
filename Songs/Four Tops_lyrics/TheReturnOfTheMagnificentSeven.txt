// You Gotta Have Love In Your Heart //

You gotta have love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

I look out my window
And what do I see
I see a world that's full of confusion
And I know just what it needs

It needs to have a little love in its heart
It's gotta have a song you can sing
It's gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

I look in my mirror
And what do I see, yeah
I see a man
Who's lost and is wandering
And I know just what he needs

He needs to have a little love in his heart
He's gotta have a song on his lips
He's gotta let freedom roll
Then he'll feel good
Yes he will

Don't you wanna feel good
Yes I do
Ooh, you should feel good
Yes I do
You've gotta feel good, oh yeah
Yes I do

You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will
You gotta have a little love in your heart
You gotta have a song on your lips
You gotta let freedom roll
Then you'll feel good
Yes you will

Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Yeah people
And I'm talking to you
And you-ooh-ooh-ooh yeah
Say it, say it again
Ooh, ooh, ooh... Oh yeah
You sound so good

// Call Me //

If you're feeling sad and lonely,
There's a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender

Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

When it seems your friends desert you,
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you

Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

Now, don't forget me
'Cause if you let me,
I will always stay by you
You gotta trust me
That's how it must be
There's so much that I can do

If you call, I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you
I'll be at your side forever

Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

Now, don't forget me
'Cause if you let me,
I will always stay by you
You gotta trust me
That's how it must be
There's so much that I can do

If you call, I'll be right with you
You and I should be together
Take this love I long to give you
I'll be at your side forever

Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
Tell me, and I'll be around

You gotta call me
Call me now

// One More Bridge To Cross //

Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Just like the wind finds a resting place
Somewhere in the busom of the land
Sowing his rich by the hands of the wise
And peace should come to every man
Just when he thinks he can lay down and roll
He's seen the place he's looking for coming up the road

Oh, is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Always one more bridge
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Now I don't wanna sing that same old song
I want a new tune that we can all sing along
We made new maps, but we didn't change the signs
Still say "This is yours and this over here is mine"
Like a little ol' man sitting on a bench
He says he rides for freedom, but he can't cross the fence
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

Oh, oh, oh one more
They say I got one more
Oh, when you get up over here, you'll find one more
When you get around the bend, you see one more
Almost made it, one more
You're so, so close
One more, but you're almost made it
You think you made it, made it at last
Just take a look and you'll see 99 and a half

Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?
Is there always gonna be one more bridge to cross?

// If You Could See Me Now //

If you could see me now,
Would my trail of tears give you a clue?
If you could see me now,
Would you remove this cup of bitter blue?

Right in the whisper's wind
I left you crying, begging please
If you could see me now,
Would you recognize me on bended knees?

Girl...
Boy, don't you know you're my everything
Without you, I'm a stranger to me

Just like a rope of sand
Our strength washed away along with love's tide
If you could see me now,
Would you see my pain exceeds my pride?

If you could see me now

Boy...
Girl, don't you know you're my everything
Without you, I'm a stranger to me

Time has balanced the books
Lines of regret embraced my days
If you could see me now,
Would you read with sorrow left its trace?

Would you forgive me
If only you could see me now
Would you return to me
If only you could see me now
Would you still love me
If only you could see me now
Would you still love me
If only you could see me now

// I'll Try Not To Cry //

I promise I'll try not to cry
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

You're finally getting your freedom now
There's nothing in your way
It's time to end all the good times that we had
I've got to go (I've got to go)

I promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I'm sure you're gonna find someone else
That won't be hard for you
Why don't you fret about what becomes of me
Don't you know I've got to go (I've got to go)

I promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I was foolish to fall in love
You were just passing through
I guess there's not much more for us to say
Don't you know I've got to go (I've got to go)

I'll promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)
I'll brush away the tears
And just might keep you here
Though I love you so
Somehow I know that you were meant to go

I'll promise I'll try not to cry
(Ain't no stopping me now)

// I'm Glad About It //

I didn't even say I wanted you, woman
I didn't even stop to think why I survived you, woman
But you walked into my life 
Like nobody's business
And you changed and re-arranged me
You turn me around
And you didn't even ask me
Hey, girl, you know you did

I didn't even think when I met you
I'll be your woman
Even only able to get through to you
Just like a woman
But I seemed so cleverly
Somehow you got to me
And now I want you with all my heart
And though I didn't want it from the start
(From the start)

I'm glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh, I'm-a glad about it
Glad about it, woman

I told you "You were wasting your time on me, woman"
And I knew about the others waiting in line
To be your woman
Yes, we were such a silly pair
Couldn't see what was there
At first, I didn't know you hanging around
But today I'm so thankful that I found
(That I found)

I'm glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh baby, I'm-a glad about it
Glad about it, woman
Oh yeah

Want you to be so proud of me
I want to learn about you
So glad that He looked down on me
Showed me that I cannot live without you

// I Can't Believe You Love Me //

Oh, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
Oh no, no, no I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty, pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss
There's no sincerity
Oh, I do believe you've gotten over me

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

Girl, whenever we're together
Not one word, honey, did you say
Oh, when I speak your name 
In the sweetest, sweetest tone, hey, hey, hey
It makes me feel like I'm standing all alone

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

You better change your ways of loving
If ought to know if you really, really care
You better show or concern
Pay more attention to me, girl (say it again, yeah)
Or otherwise I'm gonna be forced to leave you

I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe you love me 
I can't believe that you love me 
I can't believe that you love me anymore (anymore)
Not like before (not like before)

// Where Would I Be Without You Baby //

What if you should come to me
One day and say you found somebody new
I know that might sounds strange, 
But I hate to be alone
And the more I think about it, 
The more desperate I become

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Ooh, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through

When I look into your eyes
Sometimes you turn away from me
Oh, in the moment of closeness
My heart starts beating fast
But with him, it's not the same
I don't think it's gonna last

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be without you
Oh-oh-oh, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
Oh, tell me
Somebody tell me if it's a silly premonition
(Premonition)
Hey, that I got condemned from loving a girl like you
Oh, hey, hey
Don't put out the fire that burns
Can't you see how much my heart would yearn?

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, hey, hey! 
Why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through (oh-oh-oh)
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through (say we're through)
If you should say we're through

Lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through (say we're through)
If you should say we're through

Hey, hey lonely, lonely me
I don't have any idea
As to where I would be or what I do without you, baby
Hey, why would it be so easy
That there'll be no rhyme or reason for living
If you should say we're through
If you should say we're through
