Album: ReachOut

// Reach Out I'll Be There //

Now if you feel that you can't go on (can't go on)
Because all of your hope is gone (all your hope is gone)
And your life is filled with much confusion (much confusion)
Until happiness is just an illusion (happiness is just an illusion)
And your world around is crumbling down, darlin'

(Reach out) Come on girl reach on out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up (to give up)
'Cause your best just ain't good enough (just ain't good enough)
And your feel the world has grown cold (has grown cold)
And your drifting out all on your own (drifting out on your own)
And you need a hand to hold, darlin'

(Reach out) Come on girl, reach out for me
(Reach out) Reach out for me
Hah, I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you

(I'll be there to always see you through)
(I'll be there to love and comfort you)

I can tell the way you hang your head (hang your head)
You're not in love now, now you're afraid (you're afraid)
And through your tears you look around (look around)
But there's no peace of mind to be found (no peace of mind to be found)
I know what your thinking
You're a loner, no love of your own, but darling

(Reach out) Come on girl reach out for me
Reach out, just look over your shoulder
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there you can always depend on me
I'll be there

// Walk Away Renee //

And when I see the sign that points one way
The lot we used to pass by every day

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame

From deep inside the tears
I'm forced to cry
From deep inside the pain
That I chose to hide

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
Now as the rain burns down upon my weary eyes
For me it cries

Your name and mine inside
A heart on a wall
Still finds a way to haunt me
Though they're so small

Just walk away, RenÃ©e
You won't see me follow you back home
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
You're not to blame

// 7-Rooms Of Gloom //

(Seven rooms) I see a house
A house of stone
(Filled with gloom) A lonely house
'Cause now you've gone
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

You took the dream I had for us
Turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that never rings
I watch a door that never rings
Bring you back into my life
Turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house
Turn this house to a home

I need your touch to comfort me
Your tender, tender arms that once held me

(Seven rooms) Without your love
Your love inside
{Filled with gloom) This house is just a place
To run and hide
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Seven rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) Rooms of emptiness
Without your tenderness

Don't make me live from day to day
Watching a clock that ticks away
Another day, another way
Another reason for me to stay
I need you here, here with me
I need you, darling, desperately
I'm all alone, all alone
In this house that's not a home

I miss your love I once had known
I miss your kiss that was my very, very own

(Seven rooms) Empty silence
Surrounding me
(Filled with gloom) Lonely walls
They stare at me
(Just seven rooms of gloom) Seven rooms, that's all it is
Rooms of gloom
(Filled with emptiness) I live with emptiness
Without your tenderness

All the windows are painted black
And wait right here till you come back
I'll keep waiting, waiting
Till your face again I see

(Coming back
When are you coming back?)

// If I Were A Carpenter //

If I were a carpenter
And you were a lady
Now would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?

If I take on a tinkers trade, 
Would you still find me? 
Oh carryin' the pots I made
Followin' closer behind me

Save my love through loneliness
Save my love for sorrow,
Cause I have given you my ownliness, 
Give me part of your tomorrow 

If I work my hands in wood
Would you still love me? 
Ah, answer me babe, yes I would
I'd raise you high above me 

If I was a miller at a mill wheel grindin' 
Now would you miss your color box? 
& your soft shoes shining?

If I were a carpenter & you were a lady 
Girl, would you marry me anyway?
I want you have my baby

If I were a carpenter & you were a lady 
Now would you marry me anyway?
Won't you have my baby?

// Last Train To Clarksville //

Whoo, whoo! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville.
And I'll meet you at the station.
You can be there by four-thirty,
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.

'Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again.
We'll have one more night together
Til the morning brings my train and I must go.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.

Take that last train...
Take the last train to Clarksville.
I'll be waiting at the station.
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses,
And a bit of conversation, oh,
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...

Take the last train to Clarksville,
Now I must hang up the phone,
I can't hear you in this
Noisy railroad station.
All alone, I'm feeling low.
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't know if I'm ever coming home.
Hey girl, take the last train!
Bring it on home! Hey girl, hey, bring it on home!

Take the last train to Clarksville,
And I'll meet you at the station.
You can be there by four-thirty,
'cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow,
Oh, no, no, no,
Oh, no, no, no.
And I don't know if I'm ever coming home.

Take that last train! Whoo, whoo!
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Hey, take that last train! Bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville, (Girl, bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville. (Take that last train! And just bring yourself on home!)
Take the last train to Clarksville...

// I'll Turn To Stone //

If you take your love from me, 
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.

I need your love in every way.
Your love I cling to 
When things slip away.
Without your love 
I'll be lost and alone.
No reason for living 
All purpose would be gone.
Without you there 
For my eyes to behold
My life would be empty
My heart would grow cold.

If you take your love from me, 
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.

When I think of love,
I think of me and you.
When I think of happiness,
I think of us too.
You're my yesterdays
And all my tomorrows,
The air I breathe
Everything I need.
If from my life
You were ever gone,
I'd fall to pieces
You I depend on.

If you take your love from me, 
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.

Darling without you
I'll go on searching
With a lonely heart 
That won't stop hurting.
Sorrow would be written
On my face
All my tears 
Would leave its trace.
I would be like a statue in a park
Cold and alone,
A man without a heart.

If you take your love from me, 
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone.

Turn to stone, turn to stone
Just turn to stone, I'll turn to stone.
If your love I couldn't call my own.
I'll turn to stone, just turn to stone,
I'll turn to stone, turn to stone...

// I'm A Believer //

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried

I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
What's the use of trying 
All you get is pain 
When I wanted sunshine I got rain 

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
Not if I tried, no
'Cause I'm a believer
Yes I'm a believer

// Standing In The Shadows Of Love //

I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin' 
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Don't you see me standing in the shadow of love
Just tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come

All alone I'll desperately be
With misery my only company
Come today, in fact come tomorrow

Sorrow, I ain't got nothin' but sorrow
Don't your conscience bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you
Now hold a minute

Gave you all the love I had, didn't I?
When you needed me I was there, now wasn't I?
(Standing in the shadows of love
Gettin' ready for the heartaches to come)
I've tried not to cry out loud
No gal you ain't gonna help me now
What did I do to cause all this grief
Now what'd I say to make you want to leave
Now wait a minute
I gave my heart and soul to you, didn't I?
Now didn't I always treat you good, didn't I?
I'm Standing in the shadows of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
Hope to see you standing in the shadows of love
Tryin' my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of...

// Bernadette //

Bernadette
People are searching for
The kind of love that we possess
Some go on
Searching their whole life through
And never find the love I found in you

And when I speak of you
I see envy in other men's eyes
And I'm well aware of what's on their minds
They pretend to be my friend, when all the time (sweet Bernadette)
They long to persuade you from my side (sweet Bernadette)
They'd give the world and all they own
For just one moment we have known

Bernadette
They want you because
Of the pride that it gives
But Bernadette
I want you because
I need you to live

But while I live only to hold you
Some other men, they long to control you
But how can they control you, Bernadette (sweet Bernadette)
When they can not control themselves, Bernadette (sweet Bernadette)
From wanting you, needing you
But darling, you belong to me

I'll tell the world, you belong to me
I tell the world, you're the soul of me
I tell the world, you're a part of me
Bernadette

In your arms I find the kind of peace of mind
The world is searching for
But you, you give me the joy this heart of mine
Has always been longing for

In you I have what other men long for
All men need someone to worship and adore
That's why I treasure you and place you high above
For the only joy in life is to be loved
So whatever you do, Bernadette

Keep on loving me
Bernadette, keep on needing me
Bernadette

Bernadette
You're the soul of me
More than a dream, you're a plan to me
And Bernadette, you mean more to me
Than a woman was ever meant to be

Bernadette
My darling, Bernadette

// Cherish //

Cherish is a word I say to describe,
All the feelings I have hiding here for you inside.
You don't know how many times I wish that I had told you.
You don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you.
You don't know how many times I wish that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish as much as I cherish you.

Cherish is a word that more than applies,
To the hope in my heart each time I realize.
And I'm not going to be the one to share your dreams.
And I'm not going to be the one to share your schemes.
And I'm not going to be the one to share
What seems to be the life that you would cherish as much as I cherish you.

Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me,
That the right amount of letters and just the right sound
That could make you hear and make you see
That you are driving me out of my mind.

Oh I could say I need you
But then you'd realize 
That I want you, just like a thousand other guys
Who say they like you.
Like all the rest of their lies, 
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hand
And gaze into your eyes.

Cherish is a word I say to describe,
All the feelings I have hiding here for you inside.
You don't know how many times I wish that I had told you.
You don't know how many times I wish that I could hold you.
You don't know how many times I wish that I could mold you into someone
Who could cherish me as much as I cherish you.
And I do cherish you, cherish is the word.

// Wonderful Baby //

Oh wonderful baby!
Oh wonderful one!

Wonderful baby, wonderful one,
I can't describe all the wonders you've done.
You came to my life,
it was barren and bare.
You put some love and care in there.

So warm and sweet,
you came and swept me off my feet.
That day came my way
I heard you say you belong to me.
Heard you say your love was strong for me.
It was a dream come true
hearing this from you!
So wonderful!

Oh wonderful baby! Wonderful, wonderful baby!
Oh wonderful one! Oh, you are my wonderful one!

Until you came along,
I was sure a lonely one.
With no hope of finding real true love
I didn't think it could ever be done.
Then all at once that occurred
and now you have shown there's hope for the lonely!

So tenderly,
you came and brought me ecstasy.
That day you came my way
I heard you say that you would be true.
I heard you say the words I love you.
The most wonderful words
I've ever heard... so wonderful!

Oh wonderful baby! Wonderful baby!
Oh wonderful one! Oh my wonderful one!
Oh wonderful baby!

// What Else Is There To Do (But Think About You) //

Oh, you heard this before
And my punch line is poor, here's a funny twist
(Here's a funny twist)
I don't go out and roam

I prefer to be at home, at a time like this
(At a time like this)
Since you walked out that door
I don't care anymore, girl I barely exist

Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
(Oh, no)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?

People say not to worry
You'll be home in a hurry to comfort me
(Just to comfort me)
But it's not my composure
It's the sudden exposure, that's worrying me

Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
(You lovely thing you)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?

You can check my willpower
At this very hour, girl I think you'd find it was pretty low
I just sit here and brood
And I really don't mean to be rude but the truth
Girl, I think you'll find it so

Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?

So you think I should date,
And not anticipate, your sweet return
(Sweet return)
But I must follow my mind
And pretend to be blind, where you're concerned

Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?

(Don't wanna talk to neighbors or hear from friends)
Oh baby, what else is there to do
But sit here and think about you?
(Ain't gonna answer my phone, wanna be left alone)
