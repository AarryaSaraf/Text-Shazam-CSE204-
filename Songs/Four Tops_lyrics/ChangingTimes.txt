// In These Changing Times //

(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
(Never gonna stray away)

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times

How much of a sinner do you see (Stay away)
Mind you, how you miss the scenery
That's why the day
The love don't last
(Stay away)
Makes life movin'
Much too fast
(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
Never, never, never ever leave
(Never gonna stray away)
Oh, no

Oh, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, no
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

Now listen
Some men are never satisfied
Even with the right woman
By his side
(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
Changes women
Like the coins in his hand
(Never gonna stray away)
But I know
That ain't really the measure of a man
I'm too much a part of you
To be a part of someone else
(Stay away)
If I cheat on you, girl
I'd be cheating on myself

So, in these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

(I'm never gonna stray away, baby)
No, I'll never, never stray

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

In these changing times
There's no one can make me
Change my mind, girl
In these changing times
Like a rock
You're always by my side, girl

In these changing times

// Just Seven Numbers (Can Straighten Out My Life) //

Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
But my pride won't let me phone
Just seven numbers
Can get me through to you girl
Then I'll know you're really at home
You haven't been fair to me
Playing all that you see
You say you seen some of the act
I don't know that you're a coming back
If I only knew where you were
Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
If my fingers would only turn the dial
Just seven numbers can make me blue girl
Just your hello would make me smile
I haven't been fair to myself
I'm trying to call somebody else
But as soon as she said hello
I hung up the telephone line
If I only knew where you were
Just seven numbers
Can put me straight through to you
I never knew
Baby, wo-o-o
Just seven numbers
Can straighten out my life
But my fingers won't turn the dial
Just seven numbers
Can put me straight through to you babe
Just your hello would make me smile

// Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head //

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

So I just did me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they sent to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Crying's not for me, 'cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worrying me

// Right Before My Eyes //

You didn't know I saw you there
But I can name you the street and the dress that you were wearing
The other guy kinda looked like me
But will he touch you good and so sincerely?
I hated him for being with you
I felt bad, afraid for what I might do

Right before my eyes
My future died, love died
Right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt, yeah

I heard his name rumored once before
But you innocently smiled, and reassured me
Just cruising around, had nothing to do
Now, the shock I got seeing him holding you
If someone had told me, I never would've believed
But my own two eyes, they don't deceive me

Right before my eyes
Oh, my heart was touched, my dream was crushed
Girl, right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt

You are the reason our future died, love died
Right before my eyes (Right before my eyes)
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Right before my eyes
My heart was touched, my dream was crushed
Ooh, you are the reason (Right before my eyes)
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Hey, right before my eyes
It turned to dirt, my pride was hurt
Ooh, oh yeah (Right before my eyes)

// Try To Remember //

Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and callow fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember the time of September
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Deep in December It's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
Deep in December It's nice to remember
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December our hearts should remember
And follow, follow, follow

// Medley: The Long And Winding Road / In These Changing Times //

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
(Washed away)
Has left a pool of tears
Oh baby
Crying for today
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
(Let me know the way)

Let's hear it, let's hear it

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To that long, winding road
(Winding road)
You left me standing here
Oh, baby
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
No baby
Lead me to your door

(In these changing timesâ¦)
(In these changing timesâ¦)

(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
(Stray away)
(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
Never never never
(Never gonna stray)
I'll never stray away
(I'm never gonna stray away baby)
No no no never
(Never gonna stray away)

(In these changing timesâ¦)
(In these changing timesâ¦)

But still they lead me back
To that long, winding road
(Winding road)
You left me standing here
A long, a long time ago
Ohh, don't keep me waiting here
Oh, please
Lead me to your door
(Lead me to your door)
