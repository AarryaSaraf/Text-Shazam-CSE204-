// Big Fun //

If you want my love
Come and get it
Girl

And if you want me for a toy
Do I have a choice?
I don't know! 
If you want my love
Come and get it
Girl

And if you want to be my friend through thick and thin

You can fill in
That's no sin
Having big fun.

Because I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

No more work
Just a lot of play

Having big fun under the sun.
Because I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

No matter what people have to say

Having big fun under the sun

Uh
I love you
Oh
Baby
Uh

I love you
So let's have some fun! 

I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

I'm gonna love you
Each and every way

Having big fun under the sun.
No more work
Just lots of play

I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

No more problems
Each and every day

I'm gonna need you
I'm gonna want you

I'm gonna need you
I'm gonna want you
Having fun.

I'm gonna love you
Each and every day

I'm gonna need you
Each and every way

Having big fun
Having big fun
Having big fun.

Say you love me
Say you need me
Say you want me

Say you got to have me
Baby.

// I Can't Live Without Your Love //

I just can't get used to
To the thought of being here
Without your love
I need your love
And I think I never will
'Cause the memory's still here
That we once knew
I'm missing you

'Cause in the heat of night
I dreamed of how we used to
Make things right, oh...
And I realized
That I need you here
Right by my side, whoa, yeah

'Cause I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
(Just can't do without your love)
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love

'Cause in the heat of night
I dreamed of how we used to
Make things right, yeah, whoa...
And I realized
That I need you here
Right by my side, oh...
Yeah

Oh, I can't live without your love
Always thinking 'bout your love
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love
I can't live without your love
I can't resist speaking 'bout your love
(Just can't do without your love)
Don't you know that I
Can't live without your love

I can't live without your love
Just can't do without your love
Don't you know that I just can't live
Without your love, yeah

I can't without you, baby...

// Don't Take It Away //

Don't you take it, don't take it away
Don't you take it, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love

You decided that walking away
Was a thing for us to do
I don't know where to go, it's hard to say
Why don't you stay and see me through
How I need you here by my side
Why don't we both take a ride
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, yeah, don't take it away
Baby, we could have it all, don't you take it
Don't you take it, oh-oh, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love

Don't you take it, take it away
'Cause I've got a whole lot to say
Don't you know that I've been good to you
Why don't you stay and see me through
Don't you know I need you here by my side
Why don't we both take a ride
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Baby, we could have it all, don't you take it
Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Baby, don't you take your love, yeah, yeah

Don't you take it, take it away
'Cause you know I've got a whole lot to say
'Cause life with me could be so wonderful
Baby, we could have it all
Don't you take it, baby

Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Yeah, don't you take it away
Don't you take it, ooh-ooh, don't take it away
Yeah, whoa...
(Baby, don't take)

Take it, baby, ooh-ooh...
Said, I'm a lover, not a fighter
My love, you take me higher
Said I need you, baby

(Don't take it, don't take it away)
Did you hear me, baby, did you hear me, baby
Did you hear my, baby, did you hear me
Let me say it one more time
Said, I'm a lover, not a fighter
Your love would take me higher
Said I need you, baby

(Don't you take it, take it away)
Said I need you, I need you
I need you by my side, baby girl...

// I'll Always Love You //

I know the final chapter
Of our love has come
We tried to talk it out
Instead we only shout
And you know there's no avoiding
There's nowhere to run
So I will tell you now
Before you leave this time

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again

We were more than lovers
Much more than friends
But faith would test our strength
And little problems came right on in
But I know I want to try our love again
You say that you don't know
What I won't tell you before you go
We can be friends always

I'll always love you
No matter where you go, always
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go, always
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again
Yeah

In the back of my mind
I don't want you to go, always

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
Just maybe we'll be together again
No, no

I'll always love you
No matter where you go
Baby, baby, baby
I'll always love you, oh...

I'll always love you
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
I'll always love you
No matter where you go
I'll always love you
In the back of my mind
I'll always love you...
