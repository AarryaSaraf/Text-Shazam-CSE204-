// We Can Make It Alright //

We've had our share of trouble
Maybe more than others
With a little love and understanding
We can climb, climb many mountains
But as long as it's you and me, girl
There is nothing we can't do, oh

First night we kissed
I knew it was forever, oh oh oh
I can't believe that you'd ever think
Our love would ever end

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
Long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen
We can make it alright
Ooh, baby, listen to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Sometimes we listen to others
And that could be wrong
But we keep holding grudges
We let it go much too long
But as long as it's you and me, girl
There is nothing we can't do, oh

Come hold my hand
And say that you love me forever, oh oh oh
Then I will give you all that I have
Our love will never end

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
Just as long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen, yeah
We can make it alright
Ooh, baby, list to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Even if the world starts falling
You're one thing I'm sure of
As long as the love we have together
We can make it alright
Baby, listen, listen yeah yea
We can make it alright
Baby, list to your heart
We can make it alright
Baby listen listen listen

Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the world starts falling down
You're one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright
Even if the sun stops shining light
You're the one thing I'm sure of, we can make it alright

You find a love that will treat you right
I'm so glad to say that one just came my way
It was on a very special night

Wednesday lover

Wednesday lover, there's no other
She's more than I ever would more than I got
More than I ever would need
There's no other
There's no other, there's no other love
And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me

On my worthy day
I'll dare never suppress the way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet she makes my life complete
I'll always want her by my side

And I know she's the one, know she's the one for me

It seemed that all the other days takes me much too far away
'Cause I'm longing for you, for you
Thursday Friday Saturday
I wish they all would go away
What am I to do?

The way she makes me feel inside
A tender love so sweet she makes my life complete
I'll always want her by my side

// I'm Dreaming //

Here I am in the middle of the night
I see myself with you
The question is: will it be alright?
Do you believe it's true?
And perhaps tonight, even in my sleep
We'll find a perfect bliss
Don't you wake me up
Please, don't wake me up
I'm captured by your pretty face
'Cause I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
Said I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming 'bout the time that I spent with you

Trap in this vision of the past
It's hard to celebrate
Even though I know this dream won't last
And yet, I can't escape
In this fantasy right here in my dreams
I found the perfect place
For you to see in endless agony
We have no time to waste
'Cause I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming (dreaming)
I'm dreaming (dreaming, yeah)
I'm dreaming 'bout the things that we used to do
I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming. girl
I'm dreaming 'bout the time I can spend with you

Said I'm dreaming

I'm dreaming (Dreaming about love, baby)
I'm dreaming 'bout the time-

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Dreaming 'bout tonight
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Please don't wake me up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Dreaming 'bout tonight
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Please don't wake me up
