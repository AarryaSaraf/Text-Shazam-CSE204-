Album: Str8Killa

// Str8 Killa, No Filla //

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Five shots to the face, that'll do the trick
But I'll [?] before I do you, bitch
[?] for the 223 for the fuck niggas you moving with
And it feel like 'em when I'm on this robbing spree I hope yo crew agree
Snatching on these simple-ass niggas claim they gon' murder something
Niggas been talking bout murkin' the Gangster, you hoes ain't murkin' nothing
To the street shit a nigga never been no stranger, choppers? Keep a couple dozen
Never been the bird man, but I done robbed a couple of 'em
I get such a rush as I watch 'em beg for they fucking life
Reaper came down and hit the switch and turned off your fucking lights
Bitches be like, "Don't talk to Freddie, that nigga crazy"
When I first jumped off the porch older niggas tried to play me, but I got
Big balls, big paws on a small puppy
Now I'm the big dog and you mutts ain't got nothing for me
Fresh out the guts, most niggas fear it, few niggas love it
Just give me my motherfucking money
Cause all I got is...

[Hook:]
Straight killa, no filla
No sipping for a ho
Ain't taking shit from no nigga
I came up in the fingers with jackers and dro dealers
Sorry partner but I can't be rolling with ya
I gots to get my cheese...

[Verse 2 - Big Kill:]
Been in the streets too long, nigga I gotta shine
Yeah, I might hate doing wrong but bitch I gotta grind
Daughter need shoes, my sons need clothes
Two baby mamas fussing, I ain't stunting these hoes
I'm slamming them Chevy do's
Blowing Kill behind the wheel
Gittin' mo' and sliding them boulders out the Bonneville
You say [?] go hard, but his momma will
Jacked him for his package, dropped his body off behind a mill
Big Kill! Bitch I'm known to pull a 211
Them Gary police are scared of that 187
I see 'em on me so I bend a couple corners then
San Antonio to Dayton, get back on the feds
Nigga got that straight drop, hand block stay hot
Girls say he bout to test a nigga, bitch I think not
.45 sands[?] leave you leaking out your tank top
Fuck with me I'm down to let them things pop
Cause I got that...

[Hook:]
Straight killa, no filla
No sipping for a ho
Ain't taking shit from no nigga
I came up in the fingers with jackers and dro dealers
Sorry partner but I can't be rolling with ya
I gots to get my cheese...

[Verse 3 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Neckid bitch, white sheet on the stretcher bitch
Gone in sixty seconds bitch, couple shots is all I left 'em with
Hit 'em for the muhfuckin weight but I got my face sliced up by some mexicans,
Muhfuckas bout they luda, stab and shoot ya for them presidents
Cause ever since we was toddlers, we knew that we needed dollars
Tryna live off illegal product, yeah the shit they don't teach in college
Most niggas don't need no products, these corners is all they know
My homie 16 and won't see daylight till he 64
That's just how we livin' though, with limited opportunity
Twisted of reefer, parents and teachers could not get through to me
My nigga pimp was schoolin' me, put me up on the game
Don't think with your dick, but make ya bitch keep yo dick on the brain
Since then I been on it mane, and ain't thought about lookin' back
When push come to shove you can't be no pushover pushin' packs
So bitch what you lookin' at? Keep them eyeballs to the floor
We robbin' these rappin' niggas for actin' like they ain't know
You fuckin' with a KILLA

[Hook:]
Straight killa, no filla
No sipping for a ho
Ain't taking shit from no nigga
I came up in the fingers with jackers and dro dealers
Sorry partner but I can't be rolling with ya
I gots to get my cheese...

// Rep 2 Tha Fullest //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Never ever been on my level
Fuck with Fred you face to face with the devil
Raise hell to raise my funds up
Bitch I was raised in the ghetto
Pedal to the medal, foot to the floor
Three hundred fifty horses rolling
On the run cause I just kicked in the door
Hit a lick, the whip reported stolen
Tell me who out here got my back
And my dawg just got forty flat
A lot of niggas wanna hold with your four
At the end of the day man I hold my strap
And it ain't been no holding back
Hear my life told in all my raps
You probably got a problem with that
But the Midwest street shit I brought it back
What what you want, custom air Jordan's
Cab slammin on Chrome trill
Bitches who pack straps in their bag
Stacking their own- Cheaaa
Indica, Sativa, my reefer stocked tall as palm trees
Rap is for dick suckers and divas I don't recall these
Type of niggas living and breathing but I reside that
Eastside 17th streets of the G I survive that
To the hood niggas go to school do right
This shit I'm doing, nigga you could do life
Before I pick the mic I earn my stripes

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs (Jay Rock)]
I represent it to the fullest
Any given day could die by the bullet
Strictly no perpetrating when I pull it
(I represent it to the fullest
Niggas across the nation, narcotic cooking
Every block, every hood we proud of pushing)
I represent it to the fullest
Any given day can die by the bullet
Strictly no perpetrating when I pull it
(I represent it to the fullest
Niggas across the nation, narcotic cooking
Every block, every hood we proud to push it)

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Living every day like it's my last
In this fast lane, in this race is for that cash
Watts city representer, 9 double O 5 9
Got a pound for the low, whatchu smoke
Too gutta, too grimy in these LA Times
You will find, Blood or Crip, don't matter who you are
Niggas love to trip
Bitch niggas talk loud
Then it's complete silence when it bark BLOW
Niggas don't never talk it out
They spark it out, then them coroners come to chalk you out
That's what it is, another unsolved mystery
Bullets don't never have a name
Niggas just aim, squeeze and bust
When your time is up, dawg you history
Like a hieroglyph, every 24/7 on survival shit
If you floss flagging niggas kill you on some rider shit
Know who you riding with, friends backstab
Bitches it'll get you killed, in this field for sure
It's no joke on this front line
We in the trenches with big blammers, no punchlines
Ducking the one time
Got a heart of a soldier
Ain't no fear in my eyes
First signs of submission
Niggas eat you alive
Predators get squash
That's how it be happening
When you relaxing
Knowing you're responsible for your actions
I spit that real reality rap
I do it for the hood where yo analogy at

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs (Jay Rock)]
I represent it to the fullest
Any given day can die by the bullet
Strictly no perpetrating when I pull it
(I represent it to the fullest
Niggas across the nation, narcotic cooking
Every block, every hood we proud of pushing)
I represent it to the fullest
Any given day can die by the bullet
Strictly no perpetrating when I pull it
(I represent it to the fullest
Niggas across the nation, narcotic cooking
Every block, every hood we proud of pushing)

// National Anthem (Fuck The World) //

Back when I was younger
Very ambitious but often blinded by my hunger
Some say I dream too big
And my dream gon' take me under
Beneath the streets of Gary
Would I make it out, I wonder
Could my obituary be the next they read amongst the
Niggas I came up with and fell victim to this dope game
Poverty stricken so our economy is cocaine
Ecstacy, heroin, marijuana ain't no hope man
Absentee fathers and dope fiend mamas
Got my hood turned out to the point that a nigga wanna go and get paid
Fuck sittin' on the bench I'mma go on
To the next lick til I'm goin' in my grave
Then I figured after that I could make a livin'
Off makin' words rhyme it was all in my mind
Everybody in the G went to Finger Roll studio
Nobody had a flow quite like mine
But along with the fame came a whole lot of
Hate from the hood, everyday I would fight
Mama can't sleep cause I'm way to deep in the streets
She would pray through the night
Every rhyme that I spit's real shit
Cause its just another day in my life
Niggas better keep a vest test to my testicles
They be vegetables, they gonna respect the flow 'til I'm gone

One for the money
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
I keep three bad bitches for all my niggas
Wave your fingers if you're feeling the same
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
One for the money
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
I keep three bad bitches for all my niggas
Wave your fingers if you're feeling the same
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)

Player haters fuck'em, record label fuck'em
Radio fuck'em, all my shit still be bumpin'
Never change my style up for any of them, I'm strictly thuggin'
Lotta niggas made a name off banging and hustling but really wasn't
I built my name with no features or some expensive budget
Go for mine cause a co-sign can't coincide with the shit I'm bustin
You see more clear when your pockets start to see that reduction
See how true your crew is, never new they was frontin'
And I bet a nigga told you, that whatever
You go through, we got your back 'til the end
When I came upon a deal, niggas that I never knew
I could blew, wanna come be my friends
Then the boy got dropped and the friendship stopped
In a flash I was back on my own
Put a strap on my lap and the stash in the back
Cause the fact I was wrappin them stones
Got back to the rap cause its all that
I got in the mid west streets be my voice
I dont think another dude could do what I do
So it seem like I ain't got no choice
Then the hoes gon' choose the dudes that come through
Get them groovin and get that shit moist
Niggas knowin, I be runnin them hoes, and never lovin them hoes
You be up under them hoes, I hit up buncha them hoes and im gone

One for the money
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
I keep three bad bitches for all my niggas
Wave your fingers if you're feeling the same
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
One for the money
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
I keep three bad bitches for all my niggas
Wave your fingers if you're feeling the same
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)

I'm GI thuggin', I'm Chi town thuggin'
I'm Detroit thuggin', one time fuck'em
I'm NY thuggin', I'm Illadelph thuggin'
I'm DC thuggin', one time fuckin'
I'm Inglewood thuggin', I'm South Central thuggin'
I'm O-town thuggin', one time fuck'em
I'm ATL thuggin', I'm Memphis Tenn' thuggin'
I'm H-town thuggin', one time fuck'em

One for the money
Two for the motherfuckin' haters keep my name in the game
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)
I keep three bad bitches for all my niggas
Wave your fingers if you're feeling the same
(I'm screamin' fuck the world)

// The Coldest //

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Bitch I'm ten toes in it
Not a fake a facade or a cloned image
Got an eraption when ya'll jumped in the streets with my own spinach
Tryin' to get straight up off this shit so that I can go on livin'
No song spinnin' so I resort to this zone flippin'
Something must wrong with em
He takin' this shit for granted
Try to ride up in the house with no lights
You'll understand it
I can't teach ya how to dougie
But I can teach ya bout this thuggin'
Keepin' it thourough, keep your mouth closed, nigga
Keep it one-hundred
Keep yo head up out my goddamn pocket and keep it pushin'
Keep the reefer keep the white keep the sulfur just keep it cookin'
But keep in mind that any given day you can die for this
As I bag this dope I'm prayin' one day that I could just
Make an honest piece of change
Prolly change the way I live
MJ, fadeaway
I'm something niggas can't defend
Gangster Gibbs, straight out the fridge, forty below
No introduction needed cause niggas already know

[Hook: B.J.]
You already know this
But I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
You sayin' that you did that, lived that
But you ain't quite this, nigga
Cause you already noticed
But I'm the motherfuckin coldest
I keep it really real
Sayin' what the fuck I feel
So let me talk my shit
[Gibbs:] So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Really ain't shit if you ain't talk bout this
I'm runnin' raps around these rappers scratchin' em off my lists
She off that rocker so it's hard for her to stay off my dick
Tryin' get rich and let the dollars flow throughout my clique
So we can break bread
And never ever be broken
Yak tosin, these ID bitches on my balcony, smokin
We turns them out without a doubt they mouth about to be open
She put her tongue on Valerie while I'm strokin'
But I Jack Tripper
I'm that nigga playin it simple
Fresh out the G, the MTV, check her credentials
Hey been a nigga figure since the Jacksons left the city
Reppin' the hardest niggas ain't know that we was rappin' in my city
And regardless if I got supporter backin' from my city
They'll remember me as the the nigga that got it crackin' for my city
Nigga
And on the mic I never have off nights
Cause every line I write is straight frostbite, nigga

[Hook: B.J.]
And you already know this
But I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
You sayin' that you did that, lived that
But you ain't quite this, nigga
Cause you already noticed
But I'm the motherfuckin coldest
I keep it really real
Sayin' what the fuck I feel
So let me talk my shit
[Gibbs:] So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

[Verse 3: B.J.]
I'm on fire
To keep the streets hot, that's my desire
And to hell with the labels
Till it's time for us to sit down at the table
If I don't focus on me
Tell me, who will?
And I speak from my heart
So you know I'm a keep it real
So much bullshit in the last six months tried to take my focus
But on a lotta situations them people have to hocus pocus
If anybody ever asks a dumb question like "Will BJ make it? "
Give them a dollar and say "God bless you, cause you must be a basehead"

[Hook: B.J.]
And you already know this
But I'm the motherfuckin' coldest
You sayin' that you did that, lived that
But you ain't quite this, nigga
Cause you already noticed
But I'm the motherfuckin coldest
I keep it really real
Sayin' what the fuck I feel
So let me talk my shit
[Gibbs:] So what you talkin' bout, bitch?

[Outro]

// Personal OG //

Smokin' fire, pourin' up
Hennesey and Red Bull in my cup
OG Kush wrapped up in the wood
And I still smoke good in a '83 Cut
Still smoke kill in an old Deville
I keep the leather on my back, wood on the wheel
If a nigga don't blow smoke on chrome
Then I really don't feel how I'm supposed to feel
Because I feel like blowin' blunts back to back
With no shame, keep a pack and a sack to wrap[?]
At 13 I was taking Swisher Sweets to the dome
With my nigga lil rone you can ask him that
My homeboy Kendell roll thin ass blunts
So we can smoke at least 20 every day of the month
And keep at least 5 pounds of the hay in the trunk
And when he came from the Chi we was weighin' it up like
Uh
I got 16 zones of death and you can hit it at your own risk
When I travel I ain't lookin' for the local weed man
I be gone on the zone on my own shit
Got a stick or a seed in ya muhfuckin' weed
Then I guarantee you blowin' on the wrong shit
And they wonder how the kid stay blowed, eyes halfway closed
You ain't on what I'm on bitch
I'm lifted
Me and my girl just blew six blunts up in a blue 650
Charleston blue kush and blue Ken Griffey
She love the thug shit so boo get wit me
Cuz I'm young and I'm wild but I'm focused
But my dro and my flows be the dopest
And I'm a motherfuckin' marijuana addict so I had to do a song for the smokers

Smokin' fire, fuckin' up
[?] of Hendog in my cup
Couldn't wake up for a job interview this morning
The OG had me stuck
Last night I blew a whole zip with the crew
We was rollin' with hoes lapped up in the truck
Keep a gold pack of the Trojans
I let a nigga rap to a bitch while I'm wrappin' it up
[?] in yo main dame
I come straight through and get straight brain
She blow straight kill and make straight change
To make sure my pockets stay straight man
Cuz this pimp shit is in my veins, it's in my blood
I was born with it and I'mma die smokin' this fire bud
In my old school with my chrome spinnin' like
Uh
And my niggas in the bay got the kush for the 27 hundo
I'mma get 'em and sell 'em for 55, you get it for 48
If you wanna get more than one though
Go to Cali and I ship it to the G
Ship it to the Chi, ship it to the D
Ship it to my nigga in the A-town
Plus that nigga breakdown
Triple what I paid for the P that
Master kush purple dro
Keep my whip swervin' slow
Hey Fred can I hit the kill? Hell nah
Put on a sack, this personal
Cuz I'm young and I'm wild but I'm focused
But my dro and my flows be the dopest
And I'm a motherfuckin' marijuana addict so I had to do a song for the smokers

// Live By The Game //

Came up on this ghetto street, no choice but to carry heat
Ain't nothing staring me, apparently, till they bury me
I'm serving, working, Chevy hugging this curb and
Got to watch out for them jackers cause you know they stay lurking
And they itching to plot a scheme, but I won't let them stop my dream
Can't leave my crib without my tool stuffed in my jeans
They keep banging, slanging, on them corners we hanging
Get twisted in the wrong situation and leave you stanking
I was built for this, but I must admit it's just too hot
My focus in this rap shit just to get me off this block
And mama, she broke her neck to make sure I didn't want for nothing
But I was so self-destructive, I had to wish off the hustling
I'm thugging, rolling the dice with my life on a nightly basis
See if I crap out, I'll probably be trapped out, I should be patient
And paper ain't never promised, so product I push that
I just pray my baby brother don't follow my footsteps

I'm in the game, I live the game
Think about the pain, it's a shame that I can't shake the game
Everybody and they mama asking why
But I'm in the game, live by the game and in the game Imma die

I'm in the game, I live the game
Think about the pain, it's a shame that I can't shake the game
Everybody and they mama asking why
But I'm in the game, live by the game and in the game Imma die

This life I'm living like a magnet for drama
All night I fight with all my might to get that almighty dollar
I be hustling, struggling, out here thirsty and thugging
Got to watch the way I move, I got enemies by the dozen
It's cold, but I wish it wasn't, the chopper's constantly busting
These niggas that barely know me will smoke me all over nothing
They hating, waiting to put me under the pavement
Ask god to walk with me through the dark cause my heart was aching
Don't ever say your location, I swear my conscience was gone
Ain't no excuse for my actions, I know I was doing wrong
Lord I just pray you forgive me, I got blood on my hands
Tryna find a way to wipe them clean, but I don't understand
How I maneuver through this game, no fear, risking it all
When it's check out time, you best be prepared when you get the call
Now everybody and they mama asking why
But I'm in the game, live by the game and in the game Imma die

I'm in the game, I live the game
Think about the pain, it's a shame that I can't shake the game
Everybody and they mama asking why
But I'm in the game, live by the game and in the game Imma die

I'm in the game, I live the game
Think about the pain, it's a shame that I can't shake the game
Everybody and they mama asking why
But I'm in the game, live by the game and in the game Imma die

// Rock Bottom //

[Chorus:]
Damn, it can't get no worse then this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'm a get up on a muthafuckin sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin in circles man, goin in circles man
Sometimes I feel like feel like I'm goin in circles man [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Damn, if you man put some muthafuckin food on the table
That's what she said but still a nigga wasn't able to get up some
Bread for the rent, lights, and cable, the gas and water
She actin like I'm tryna starve her and I know the baby growin
And her belly gotta eat too only thing I got left is this gun on my belt
If I can't feed myself how I'm a feed you how I'm a ride with this tank on empty
Sellin yola hopin that the jakes don't get me cause when I leave the crib
Man that thang go with me my nigga from the jets got stained for a
50... sack of the hard tryna match you a broad gotem shot up in his car
By a muthafuckin dope fiend a bitch tryna get a fix put my nigga in a ditch
We been hittin dem licks since we was 14
Now they say you inna calmer place I could'nttell
By the looks on yo momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin to chase

Cause we was cookin the base and we was flippin the spinach
And if a nigga violated then we handled our business
We neva knew one day the street shit a catch up with us
And I don't roll with many niggas you was one of the realest I'm like

[Chorus:]
Damn, it can't get no worse then this cause I done hit rock bottom
I'm a get up on a muthafuckin sack and a big ass bottle to solve all my problems
I'm goin in circles man, goin in circles man
Sometimes I feel like feel like I'm goin in circles man [x2]

[Verse 2:]
Damn, open my mailbox and all I get to see is bill after bill
Shit kinda slow ain't no real money been comin in but yo I still got ten on the kill
Ten on the drank, a nigga be on ten when I'm sober to get me over keep me full of the poison
My nigga rich doin a bid they sent the boys in to getem if woulda been witem I woulda joined him
And now I'm out here lurkin the streets with no work feelin like my throat been cut with no plug
You know just what I mean if you eva done sold drugs finna rob me a nigga cause I ain't got no love
And I ain't got no qualification for no career move people up in corporate america probly fear dude

// Oil Money //

[Verse 1 - Chuck Inglish:]
Where do we have to go?
I don't know, let me know where we end up
Cause Iâm not about to sit and watch it get us
Just picture the stickers is on it
And its flashy, flauntinâ, funny but them people only want that gold to pawn it
I need that gold to wear it on the court like Iâm Jordan
Performinâ, Iâm scorinâ way more than Iâm supposed to
And Iâm lookinâ way better in person than my photos
But lets not talk about me
Lets talk about this
If itâs too hot, then take your hands off
Pass it like Joe Montana
Champions
Hats off, salute
Now what do you look forward to, the landing or the take off
Get back, cause them Apes I gotta Harlem Shake off
I got the paint; I just need some shit to paint on

[Hook - Dan Auerbach:]
This is a lullaby
Not intended to make you cry
But to open up your eyes
And in this lullaby
You got to do right
Before you die
Before you die

[Verse 2 - Chip Tha Ripper:]
Cleveland nigga, wintertime I catch a flight to somewhere sunny
Come to visit
Fuck yo couch they shouldnât have gave us niggas money
For the honeys
Like they woulda said in â94
Bumpin' Jodisee, and anything I say'll prolly go
While we smoking in that âLac truck, headed to the mall
Now we coppinâ even though I left my wallet in the car
Yeah she got it, deposit: we got it, good credit, good head, and it's all copasetic
She cool and she get it, priceless
And nice tits, she got that look twice chest, she righteous; we might just
Valet the Mercedes in the front just to give âem what they want
Cameras flashinâ, hoppinâ out with the blunt

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Who knew this rappinâ shit would pay off
Iâm firinâ up the kill like I got fired on my day off
Seen a whole lotta niggas get broken by some broad they like to break off
And the same old bitch they spent that change with be the same bitch Iâm gon' shake off
The monster of the mid yo
Quick to Richard Dent a nigga
Peace to all my OT hoes and the gifts they love to send a nigga
Fresh white socks and a black d bones
We done broke down bags with the realest niggas
Spittin' these flows on stage at the show, blowinâ Optimos and Swishas witcha
(Feel it nigga?)
If y'all don't, then I can keep my day job
Ski mask my uniform, them dope dealers gon' stay robbed
T-top ceiling and my dank still stankinâ and I crush ya feelings like the Saints did Peyton

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Bun B:]
Fresh pair of Leviâs, white tee, and 6 Carmines
Hoppinâ out some 2010 shit; yes, the carâs mine
Sittinâ in Corinthians sit back watch the stars shine
I know you starstruck, shit I can leave a star blind
Booyah, just like Isiah
A playa, the pro bowl, the mayor
Iâm so cold, they stare
The ho strollâs prepared, Iâm pimpinâ my ride out
Then back to my lair
The honeycomb hideout
Your honeyâs gon' hide out in my crib like a fugitive
She wanna have a ball; I told her I got two to give
She wanna see the flashinâ lights and red carpet
I let her pop a double stack, Iâm tryin' to start shit
Sheâs on a bear skin, layinâ in her bare skin
Her bodyâs super thick and itâs fair skin - Iâm there then
On the sofa, smokinâ jacket, Gucci loafers, and Iâm blowinâ on a Swisher, while sheâs blowinâ me
Its over [Repeat x6]
