Album: TheMiseducationOfFreddieGibbs

// G.I. Pride //

[Verse 1:]
I was born in small town with big dreams
Pops told me as a child I would do big things
Used to watch him in the mirror when he used to rehearse
Hella talented but talent wasn't makin' no merch
Another product of that Gary, Indiana
Sex, drugs, and murder
Dirty politicians, dirty police, dirty burners
On the streets as a worker
Was a very fast learner
School never taught me how to be a earner
Before you mothafuckers bother me just take a look at this economy
Cause economically we at the bottom
So playa hatin' niggas copy me
My enemies they tried to body me
But couldn't get to me before I got 'em
A motherfuckin' problem
Gangster Gibbs
When I do it do it big
Put it down for the crib
Rap shit to totin' that cash shit
And it's plain to see
That it ain't no changin' me

[Hook:]
I'm comin' live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it's plain to see
That it ain't no changin' me
Nigga I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)

[Verse 2:]
I'm comin' live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity, not a tear in my eye
Why cry, I'm a blaze another blunt n' get high
Look in the sky, blow the smoke to my niggas
Pray to God for forgiveness
Yes I'm sinnin' but I'm winnin' and it's bidness on you bitches
You can go against my wishes and put a stop on my riches
Then my peeps leave you sleep in Lake Michigan with the fishes
Niggas think that it's fictitious till they hear that ratta-tatta
Niggas scatter
Even senior citizens tote the hammer
Thought that Gary, Indiana was movin' on up the ladder
But I guess it didn't matter when the crackers got sick'a Hatcher
They turn their back to us
Introduce crack to us
Got you ridin' with that iron in that black Buick
I been through it, you can feel it in my music
Cook it up and move it
This is how we do it

[Hook:]
I'm comin' live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it's plain to see
That it ain't no changin' me
Nigga I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)

[Verse 3:]
Nigga I represent the East side
7-tier GBT town
Riff block, valley boy
Nigga catch a beat down
Midtown, Marshalltown, Avignon, Goldmiller
GV Concord
Bronx niggas real killas
Etna to Ironwood, full of crazy niggas
Shady niggas, can't forget 'bout my Delaney niggas
And all my homies through the streets of the G
I'm gonna let the streets speak though me
It's for them cats pushin' packs in the hallway
Doin' it the hard way
Posted on the corner like liquor stores on Broadway
Watchin' for the jackals keep 'em clappin for the gunplay
Live for the day
Motherfuck what a nigga say
I'm just showin' off my GI pride
Anywhere the kid go, you know GI ride
So I dedicate this record to my GI thugs
And I bleed the same GI blood

[Hook:]
I'm comin' live from the
G, A-R-Y
Good or bad, right or wrong
Where the young boys die
No mercy, no pity in my city and it's plain to see
That it ain't no changin' me
Nigga I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
I said I'm fresh up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)
Nigga I'm straight up outta
(Gary Indiana, Gary Gary Indiana)

// What It Be Like //

You can take it how you wanna take it homie
Yea you hear the record spinnin'
So you know I'm gettin' money
Got a spot, can't another nigga come and take it from me
Now you wanna sideline, fucked up, lookin' funny
And I'm flossin' in the 68' oldsmols
Subtract another booty, blowin' fruity with yo' hoes
You wanna be like me but you making that no flow
I got some dealers that'll hit you up for that rose gold
I'm fresh up outta Indiana nigga
Gary to be exact
Got my ticket with this rappin' through Gary up on my back
I'm in business with them nigga that keep a clip in the gat
Knees on the lac
Catch you in the kitchen whippin the crack
I'm a come up on some swishas and twist up anotha sack
Got your girl leavin with her, she wonderin' where she at
What she said up in the Jag, if she let a nigga stab
But if not I put that bitch in the cab
I'll see ya later babe

All my thug ass nigga, what it be like
All my down ass hoes, what it be like
No I don't fuck around ho, what it be like
You know I bust down ho, what it be like
All my East coast nigga, what it be like
All my West coast nigga, what it be like
All my dirty South nigga, what it be like
All my Midwest nigga, what it be like

Say nigga what it be like
Wanna go to war with me you better get your G's right
I'm a bout to show 'em what these G.I. streets like
Broad day to midnight
Better keep your heat tight
2: 11 1-8-7 semi-automatic weapon
Make a nigga get to steppin'
I don't care what set he reppin'
Bustin' in my own discretion
Bout to teach that ass a lesson
I be getting threatened by these lame brain niggas
But I never sweat 'em
Real niggas show me love in the hood
I ain't never got problems cause I got plugs in the hood
You might see me politickin' with them thugs in the hood
That's the type of shit I does in the hood
Middle-finger to you bitch ass niggas
Dog ass hoes
Y'all can keep on hatin' and thinkin' we gettin dough
The G's at my show
They rush the front row
Throw they sets in the air
Let a mothafucka know

All my Vice Lord nigga, what it be like
All my G.D. nigga, what it be like
All my Black Stone nigga, what it be like
All my Renegade nigga, what it be like
All my Latin King nigga, what it be like
All my Crip gang nigga, what it C like
All my Blood gang nigga, what it B like
We all the same gang nigga, what it be like

// From Tha G //

One time for your mind, uhh
Yo, creepin' rollin in my ole green hoopty
Trunk quakin' niggas can't take it, bitch sue me
You boys don't move me, I blow my green
I get high while I drive, yea thats my routine
On the daily..I go kiss my momma on the cheek
Throw my nikes on my feet, roll a sweet, and I hit the street
Rest in peace to my cousin, we buried him last week
Hopefully the day they don't put me under the concrete, I peep
These niggas reaction when I pass em
Smile at a playa, but really they wanna blast em
Really for no reason, but beefin' is everlastin'
Rather walk up and shoot em, then simply walk up and ask em
How can we get along? Crackers knowin' its wrong
1 deceased, 1 in jail, 2 niggas with 1 stone
This the type of shit we face in this place that I call home
Some niggas just gettin' by, some niggas is gettin' known

And I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Mid to the South worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G
So I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
East to the West worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G

Yup, most niggas from the G ain't one hundred
Get in the mix with a bitch nigga, you'll learn from it
I done seen niggas get burn from it and locked down
I only fuck with certain niggas when I come around
Big rock, fingeroll, Heddin, them my niggas
Willy picked up the liquor, J.P. done rolled up the swisha
E-Dub and Ironwood, D-Edge and Ivoe
Derett, Turtlebanks, my niggas from Chicago
And all the hoes I know, you know I got love for yea
Hard dick, hard liquor could kill up a blood for yea
Hoes sneaky they be creepin', like leeches...they blood suckas
Fuck with me cause Freddie Gibbs ain't your typical motherfucker
(Nahh) I'm way to cool to be a fool for a broad
Cause bitch I'd rather hit the mall with my motherfuckin' dawgz
I cut a lot of motherfuckers off though
Now they got my dick in they mouth, fuck what you thought ho

And I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Mid to the South worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G
So I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
East to the West worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G

Baby I been blowin' kill in different area codes
Southern Cali, Southern Texas, and Southern Florida hoes
Put my bitch up in the tiki, but nigga hot in the cold
Summertime to the winter these niggas dump and reload
Bustin' until they hit it, plenty wigs get splitted
In a city full of crooked polices and politicians
I be all in different parts of the country, different adventures
But I never could forget about 17th and Virginia
Land of lost hope, clouds of mill smoke
Community devoured by hard, and soft dope
Addicts they can't cope, Vice Lords and Folks
Every man for himself these niggas is cuttthroat
I flow coast to coast where the Gs' be at
Nothin' but pride in my city and I bleed for that
I love Gary, Indiana like weed and yack
Even if they don't love me back, I'm gettin' scratch

So I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Mid to the South worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G
So I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
East to the West worldwide, or wherever I be
I let a motherfucker know I'm from the...G

// Queen (Luv U 2 Death) //

[Gun Shots]
She like the realest shit I ever wrote
She like a drug addiction for my pain and sickness
She the antidote, like the most killest shit I ever smoked
Her color and the texture of skin, boost my high with every stroke
She got a steady gig, own car, own crib, no kids
Let's start a family baby, I'm convinced
You that stability that my life lack
The type of Woman that make a gangsta wanna clean up his act
And baby I know I get out of line sometimes
But understand that all I do, I do for us, you gotta respect my grind
I play the cost that I was dealt the best a nigga could do
Won't let my street position weaken my position with you
Because you my Queen, put nothing above you and I'mma show you
Please don't worry bout them bitches before you, Cuz they below you
You the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
You know what I mean you my Queen, I love you to death

She been here with me through it all
And even when a nigga fall
She be right there to pick me up again
Sometimes I feel like she my only friend
The only person I can trust
The only one I can confide in
Man she the only thing I really need
She like the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
She the type to fix my meal and twist my green
Y'all know what I mean? She's my Queen
I love her to death

If she was selling pussy, She'd be on a gold mine
Hard to take attention away from something that's so fine
And every time I see ya, I'm in the panties in no time
Liquor in the morning, she make the breakfast with no swine
Eggs, turkey bacon with the cheese and the grits
In the crib I hide the pills and the weed by the brick
About a half by the O, Little Ron, Little snow
I don't bring my niggas over there so don't nobody know
Until one day my girl was taking off to go to the store
Two mothafuckas with them choppas walked her back in the door
They like, Yo gimme the dope, the weed, the money out the bedroom
Make it snappy bitch, I'm about to put one in her head soon
Man I don't know shit about no dope or no weed
She like, baby please give em what they want so they can leave
Niggas stuck me for my cheese and disrespected my Queen
On my momma I'mma make them niggas bleed, I love you to Death

She been here with me through it all
And even when a nigga fall
She be right there to pick me up again
Sometimes I feel like she my only friend
The only person I can trust
The only one I can confide in
Man she the only thing I really need
She like the perfect verse, perfect Earth to plant my seed
She the type to fix my meal and twist my green
Y'all know what I mean? She's my Queen
I love her to death

She my French vanilla butter pecan chocolate deluxe
Most these niggas act like bitches, but she the bitch that I trust
Since them niggas left me stuck, My pockets been fucked up
He and She don't feel like We, It's Me and Her
Fuck us Fuss cuss Fuck fight, under the same roof
I think this bitch just set me up and now I just need proof
She getting random calls, random texts from her ex
It didn't take too long for me to make the dots connect
And bitch you know me and this nigga got beef
I can't believe you down to sacrifice my life to put him back on his feet
He out here flossing with my money and you breaking bread with him
Motherfuck him if you love him, I'mma leave you dead with him
I was down to give my life for you, wife for you
Loved you from the start, stanking ass bitch you breaking my heart
Ho I should shoot you in yo face, close-casket your wake
But I'mma show respect and bang you in the chest, I love you to [Gun shot]

// Flamboyant //

East Side GI, what up?
Goon life, what up?

These bench warmers never actually been part of the action
I wanna be legit, but being broke would be a distraction
My only interest is pimping and pandering, pistol packing
So fuck rap, I ain't that nigga that be rapping about rapping

I got away with shit that could've put me under the prison
My recent run ins with police has got me under suspicion
I bet they never find me guilty under my own admission
This shit is part of god's plan, this was not my decision
In hell's kitchen, but I'm chefing up a fresh cold plate of revenge
On you fuck niggas and fair weather friends

I got them nervous because I got niggas still rocking
Despite my flights with police lights and light pockets
I'm still the same dog
Same killer flow but your rap is a different game, dog
Not gone compromise my pride to entertain ya'll
Hip hop I damn near hate ya'll
I'm sick and tired of all these Autotuned ass niggas
I miss Nate Dogg

Miss me with that back and forth video blogging
Because a nigga really out here robbing
If I felt you was a bona fide problem, I'd bring straight at ya
Only Youtube niggas bust guns on camera
I could shoot dudes quicker than paramedics can handle
Watch a motherfucker down that amble, take his last rock

Indiana's all time greatest, but I ain't satisfied
Fuck the rap game, I'm your favorite by a landslide
Whether niggas know it or not yet
My shit about to knock on every block, every project
It's East 17th, put it down for my set
So blame it on them crackers why my album ain't dropped yet

I guess I'm too hard for Power 92 or GCI
And I'm just a hop, skip, and a jump from the Chi'
But bitch I'm out the dos-uno-nueve, es para mi que llegue
Pushed D in EC and got in shootouts with eses
Them niggas down in 'Nap know that I ain't scared to blast, nig'
Jack them pussy niggas for they rims at the Classic
A black mass of black kush wrapped in plastic
35 dollars for the gram, I was taxing

Telephone calls from her man while I'm smashing
Slay your main dame, have her mashin' for rations
Your ho' give me the whole check, so ho' check it
Got smokers on my team that like to smoke they dope naked
With a crack ho' stroking his rope
He want the hard and the broad, so I'm serving them both
I flip a spot to a one stop shop for rock and hot cot
Got lines of Lenny Bias, so throw in your snot box

Niggas rhyme these days, at times it's not hot
Labels buy they own records and pay for the top spot
Am I in the wrong business, I wonder, "Should I stop?
Is my music going to take care of my mama if I flop?"
Is a nigga gonna depend on that?
I think not, if you think so
You think slow, so don't think, ho'
Freddie Gibbs run up in cribs like Kris Kringle
Touch down and talk more shit than Ocho Cinco

My people slaved in this American regime
This need I feel remain, Rahim, stay on my team
Praise to the most high, fuck everything in between
Seen young black kings and queens turned to fiends
Swallowed up in the machine, nahmean, straight greasy
You lock a nigga up, what I'ma do when they release me?
Shout out to Finger Roll, C Mac, and Will Screezy
The reason why I make it look easy, East Side, nigga

// In My Hood //

Woke up this morning in a bed that didn't belong to me
Gotta get on my feet and hit the streets the hood callin me
The time I waste is costin me, so I hop off in that bucket
Balling on a budget peel the top off my cutlas
Lemmie get up in the whip, turn up my shit cruise
And I'm not gonna stop till I'm one of those dudes makin major moves
Until that day I gets my pay anyway necessary
All I got is my dreams, ain't no other options up in Gary
I still love it, ain't no other place like it until I'm finished I'mma represent it
Much love to the niggas in the G that get that paper keep it pimpin
Independent women thats holdin down their household
My ghetto soldiers that struggle to bear their heavy load
I do this shit for yall, all my people dead and gone
And my dogs doin sentences behind the wall
I'm just a rebel with a cause livin' up to no good
Often misunderstood another day in my hood

[Hook:]
Some things'll never change, but it's okay cause I'm good I'm tippin grippin wood
Another day in my hood, I'm from the ghetto mane
Wouldn't change it if I could, often misunderstood, just another day in my hood
[X2]

We flip our doors up the whole hood stop and stare
Ghetto superstars with their cars ridin in the L
Roll the window down you see I got the screens flippin too
We don't deck and I got my crew, gotta make it to the neighbhor hood barbeque
And, flirt with some bitches and I burn up a swisher
When the ghettos out to get ya we kick it while sippin liquor
The violence and the stress it get to work in your nerves'
I flip that bottle pop the top and pour some yac on the curb
Yeah, some things'll never change just charge us to the game
Niggas in the hood don't hear the same, they straight blow out ya brain
I grew up on Virginia street, 1631 right up off of 17th
If you see me I'm with my heat, yall better recognize and respect that
Go into the park, I'mma rep that
West side to east side if its G.I then thats where I rest at
So you might catch the kid puffin that goods
Spendin cheddar on leather grippin' woods
Another day in my hood

[Hook x2]

// How We Do ('93 Til...) //

Once upon a time round '99, I took a chick to the prom with a big behind
She had a cute face, a thin waist, a bright smile
Titties mediocre, but ass was like BLOWW!
Might have been two thou' when I met that ho
But on the low I used to sweat that ho, I had to let that go
Cause baby had me with a hell of a crush
Love letters on her locker, I ain't give no fuck
What other niggas thought about me
Cause I was all about we, me and her 'til I D-I-E
Made me want to do some shit like carve her name in a tree
Like we was K-I-S-S-I-N-G
But little did I know she had a dude
With hella money, hella jewels, I was just another nigger at school
A straight fool, for thinking I was special or different
Lost my respect for the rest of the bitches
I played hoes and shank hoes for bankrolls
Never thought they'd fill my heart with pain though
I would laugh when a broad made my niggers feel blue
But the jokes ain't funny when the joke's on you
Let me stroke something boo, let me get that pearl
Touch your soft spot, let me in your world
And you can be his girl, and that nigger can remain your man
Freddie G'll be your back-up plan

[Hook: x2]
It's how we do
Cause why have one when a nigga can have two
Three or four hoes I like the ass brand new
Just fuck with me and I'll stay true
"I love you"
Yea yea I love you too

It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do

I had a bad bitch from Nap named Nicole
Nicole used to keep a nigga dick on swole
She knew I had a girlfriend, but she love my pole
And when she saw me with my woman, then she lost control
And went crazy, "Freddie I can't believe you played me
People told me that niggas from the G was shady
You forgot you didn't wear a rubber when you laid me
I'm pregnant and it's your baby"
Hell of a bind, these hoes put me through a hell of a time
Met a girl last year that I thought was mine
Came all the way to NY to see me rhyme
Flew her ass out to LA for Christmas time
And shit was fine, we on the same beat
She ain't got a problem with me being in the street
I know I ain't no one and only, but I'm hoping I ain't one of many
Baby pretty, but she try to play me silly, cause she really wasn't
Thinkin 'bout religion when she tell me the dick bomb
But then she up and left me cause I practice Islam
I guess Mom told her that the boy ain't right
And she gon' pray to Jesus Christ to take me out of her life
And out of her sight, she keep it undercover
I really used to mean it when I told her that I love her
But now I know that love is a four letter word
Like fuck and shit
So love you can suck my dick, baby it ain't about you

// World So Cold //

The most perfect mistake I made
Really knew that I gave it raw to any bitch I laid
But I did it whether love or lust it ainât no thing
Just canât wait for you see the light of day so I pick yo name
Watch you take yo first breath stumble and take yo first step
Speak yo first word, yes Iâm so blessed
To be a part of something greater than me
So you you can be anything you dedicated to be
Cuz I ainât dedicate myself to nuttinâ but these streets
So this how we gotta eat from pills to green leafes
Rocks to white powder, butter to raise cheddar
Got the blood of a thug but you gonâ be raised better than that
And I know that Iâd be filled with joy
Whether he blessed me with a healthy girl or boy
I'mma praise you, even though it's hard to raise you in a world
A world so cold

It feels like Iâm barely breathinâ
And the blood in my veins so close to freezinâ my
Momma raised me but she couldnât save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I canât save you from a world
A world so cold

Yo I can keep it in a needle in a dope fiend vein
80s through the present seen the dope scene bang
Lookinâ at 80 years over 14 thangs
Momma prayinâ for a son with hopes that he change
Hopeâs that heâll get it together he make her nervous
Just the thought of her attending a child funeral service
What a horrifying sight to see
Not a healthy way of life but itâs the life for me
So now I gotta make life right for you or my lifeâs a waste
Me and yo Momma argue everytime she she my face
She beggin me to settle down but I donât play like that
A rollinâ stone so my homeâs where I lay my hat
You know I get right back
I ainât husband material so I donât spend my time like I spend my
Scratch
But Iâmma clothe you, feed you, never gonâ leave you in a world
A world so cold

It feels like Iâm barely breathinâ
And the blood in my veins so close to freezinâ my
Momma raised me but she couldnât save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I canât save you from a world
A world so cold

Sheâs seven months you gon' be here in a lilâ bit
Move yo momma in, got the colors for ya room picked
Baby shower, baby shoes, all type of new shit
Sideline hoes I donât want nuttinâ to do wit
How can I play yâall while I watch her carry you around
I got excited from pictures of your ultrasound
She told me I'mma have a son and Iâm the one
And she at the doctorâs office for a visit, can I come
Dead Silence, News got it dead in the room
Pregnancy complications left you dead in the womb
Maybe I take the blame God punish me for old sins
The tears hit me when I think of what you could have been
I flame jane try to smoke away the pain
But I know the bond that we made wasnât in vain
Could have been my little Freddie
But I guess you wasnât ready for a world
A world so cold

It feels like Iâm barely breathinâ
And the blood in my veins so close to freezinâ my
Momma raised me but she couldnât save me from a world
A world so cold
Cause when a nigga barely make it
He forget how to ask for shit he just take it
I can raise you but I canât save you from a world
A world so cold
