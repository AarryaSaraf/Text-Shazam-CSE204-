// The Real G Money //

As these drugs alter my heartbeat
Ain't been taking my medication, don't get me started, G
Hustling, jacking, murder, and macking been such a part of me
Such an evil seed, wonder what will my son or daughter be?
Killers
I'm too crazy, ain't fit to raise 'em
Streets might send yo daddy off on vacation or early grave him
Asked my pastor, is there some special place in heaven for gangsters?
In the eighth grade I was selling eight-balls off that pager, put it on my nation
I'm done living out my shoebox
Crack rock cooking on two pots
Came up in the school of the ski mask
Where you quick to make a punk bitch move out
I'm raised way deep on the east side
Right next to the Dorie Miller projects
GDs, Vice Lords on the same set
Wear ya hat the wrong way, you get popped at
And I got a hundred round drum on the AK
Killed a nigga and his homeboy the same day
Now I'm looking for the third motherfucker cause I burn motherfuckers in the rap game same way
And the label never gave no fucks
Tell 'em only thing that dropped was these nuts
Thinking that I'm playing with niggas cuz I don't cater to niggas
I just be taking from niggas and I be waiting for niggas to get

[Hook:]
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water, burn 'em
Let's get it started
Ho, we don't need no water
Cause I woke up, lit my smoke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, lit my smoke up, and said fuck the world
Woke up, cooked my dope up, and said fuck the world

If you gangsta and you know a nigga stacking bands
Whether you knee-deep in them kilos or you sacking grams
This life we live, man, it's so cutthroat make you clap your friends
No ambulance, they just took their bodies in matching vans
Please call the coroner, left some trash on my corner, bruh
I was on tour for the summer, every bitch I fucked was a foreigner
And your bitch was a bust it, met the whole click, fucked, and recorded her
Got some top at the Marriot, dropped her off in the morning
Girl, my morning cup of coffee is a double cup of syrup
Don't take orders from no nigga, fuck your boss and fuck the world
And I'm good in every hood, don't need no passes or referral
Me and crack go way back like starter caps and jheri curls
Whip it girl

[Bridge x2:]
From a G to a kilo
To a mill from a motherfucking zero
4-5 when I look through the peephole
Nigga, I'm the real G Money, no Nino

[Hook]

// Came Up //

I woke up and wrote this for my hater, mane
Forgis on that thing with a four fifty four, I'll see you later, mane
Bitches gonna bop, tell 'em pop that pussy for this paper, mane
Ho just wanna kick it, so I backseat Escalade her, mane
Thugging, and if you with me then you do the same
Got some partners doing life for the thing we do for this change
Tried the rap shit cause my big homie told me switch up my lane
Nigga, this trap shit get you stuck in a grave or locked in a cage, mane
Yeah, I put my ski mask on and fucking came up, came up
Staying on this thug shit, bitch, I fuck the game up, game up
And you know this rap shit ain't gon' fucking change us, change us
Real Midwest gangstas hit ya plug and flame up, flame up
Dumping hollow tips for my enemies like yeah
Fuck you pussy boys in this industry like yeah
Fuck the records, I'm knee deep in the streets
New white girl on my phone, keep the Nikes up on my niece's feet like yeah

[Hook x2:]
I jumped off in the streets and fucking came up
Forgis on everything, I fuck the game up
Woke up and wrote this for my fucking haters
That hate the way a nigga came up

Uh came up, I'm never coming down
Nigga ain't have shit, sat the bench, now bitch I run the town
Heard niggas in the street want me hit, heard I can't come around
Nigga stepped all through your event, yeah bitch I shut it down
Thugging, and if you with me you'd be on a job
Private party, fifty freaks in a suite for me and my squad
Me and my partners, Gary, deep in the streets, less than a mob
Had a chopper thing, go beat down your block and then beat the cops, mane
Yeah, I stepped off in the booth and fucking came up, came up
Every tape I drop made these little niggas step they game up, game up
Nigga heard Young Gibbs, now it seem his flow done changed up, changed up
But I don't give no fuck, little nigga, my dues been paid

Up, paid

Up
Now bust hollow tips for my enemies like yeah
Fuck you pussy boys in this industry like yeah
Fuck your records, I'm knee deep in the streets
Got white girl on my phone nigga, whip it up if you feeling me like yeah

[Hook x2]

// Hundred Thousand //

[Hook: G-Wiz]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of cocaine
Niggas'll kill you in these fucking streets
Each and every day I duck the feds, man
Trying keep my baby something to eat
Down to my last, 'bout a quarter thing
Ain't no love in these dope streets
Ain't trying to be the man, just trying to maintain
I swear, this game gon' be the death of me

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I swear, this game gon' be the death of me
Fuck niggas in these streets wanna suck my blood and rip my flesh from me
Youngsters trying to air me out and leave my body cold
Sell my dope on Sunday, can't do church, have mercy on my soul
Have caine, Carolina park king
And I came fresh on them Forgis, forty thousand in my jeans
Nigga got back to the flip, ain't gon' let no bitch shit on my dreams
Unadjusted to the mob, stayed on my job, ho what you mean
100K might give me four of those
Have my prices show me those
Hit me in the daylight, if it's late night then my store will close
Seen some niggas overdose
Not only dope, but money and power
Dirty dancing with the fucking devil in my darkest hour
What you know about it

[Hook: G-Wiz]

[Verse 2: Hit Skrewface]
Hundred thousand dollars worth of cocaine
Make it stain, slanging things, knee-deep in the dope game
Police in my rearview cause they think I'm serving white
And they probably right
If they hit them lights, you know I'm swerving right
Now I ain't stopping, them bitches gon' have to catch me
And before I let 'em do that, them bitches gon' have to stretch me
Cause it's do or die, life or death, what you rep, right or left
For the folks, five or the six, or is it on the four
These niggas kill in the streets over gang signs
I heard some niggas wanna murk me cause I got them things flying
But I ain't dying, you ain't fucking with no coward
Dirty dancing with the fucking devil in my darkest hour
What you know about it

[Hook: G-Wiz]

// D.O.A. //

[Hook 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I'm a real-made nigga
Certified grave digga
D.O.A., it's how I play
I let the fucking things hit ya
I'm a street-paid nigga
Tryna catch a fade with ya
D.O.A., it's how I play

[Pre-Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
I fuck with gangsters
Man, all my niggas make the papers

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I fuck with gangsters
Man, all my niggas make the papers
Them boys is stinking
East side G.I., we don't serve no strangers
My bitch is stinking
My junkies say they need that wake up
My kitchen stinking
It's a straight bake sale when I cook that cake up
Mobbing-ass nigga, fuck a project-ass nigga
Serve the pack, man, call the trashman for these garbage-ass niggas
Say these motherfuckers scared to rob a robbing-ass nigga
Send you back to your connect, you short a lot of bands, nigga
Gangsta Gibbs, baby greasier than Weezy at the All-Star
Way too often, Jeezy, he wasn't even in my ballpark
Swing straight for the fence and drop my nuts down on the plate
I made your favorite rapper want to put a price up on my face
It's Gangsta Gibbs

[Pre-Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

Real-made nigga

[Verse 2: G-Wiz]
D.O.A., get it how I live it when I let that four go
Naptown nigga, done made it, emerging fresh out the dope smoke
All my niggas hustlers and killers, green light we all go
Send 'em all to they makers and close casket they funerals
No smiling, came up out a dirty alley with the thugs
Banging TECs and repping sets, young connoisseurs with them drugs
Pack the baggage, flip the cabbage, keep it slamming every day
How the fuck niggas talking bout R.I.P. when boy you 'bout to
D.O.A. yourself

[Verse 3: Big Kill]
Bang bang bang, gang bang is all I fucking know
Blazing rocks with killers and some motherfucking cutthroats
And I know Colombians that bring it by the fucking boat
Clap they ass, put they ass face down on the fucking floor
Hit a couple corners and nigga know I got the blow
Hit a couple corners now and nigga know I got the store
Riding down Grant Boulevard, pulling out the four
On my way to Ham Block, figure cause I'm on dope
Kill

[Pre-Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

[Hook 2: Freddie Gibbs]

// Lay It Down //

Lay it down, bitch
Bitch, lay it down
Straight to the cake
Take it to the face
Boy, don't make a sound
Got a K for the fake
Case full of weight
Thug nigga 'bout my peso
All-black with the strap
Cup full of Ac
Y'all niggas sip that Karo
Iâm blowed than a motherfucker
Million dollars in, bitch I'm on like a motherfucker
Smoking strong like a motherfucker
Vice Lord, Folk, Black Stones in this motherfucker
From the land of the gangbang
Neutrons get crossed out, niggas can't hang
Better watch what you say, mane
Ten, eleven phones and they all running cocaine

[Bridge x2:]
I be with them killers, bitch
I be with them drillers, nigga
Certified drug dealer, bitch

Straight water whippas
Thug to the judge, free all my niggas

Black mask on that ass, choppa split ya

[Pre-Hook x4:]
Lay it down, bitch
Bitch, lay it down

[Hook x4:]
I be with them killers, bitch

Lay it down, bitch

You niggas ainât 'bout it
Nothing but a dollar on my line, ho
If a nigga wasnât rapping
Nigga be trapping out of a 'bando
If you niggas want static
Fully automatic, yeah thatâs Bando
Still whipping up the dough, mane
G.I. nigga got slugs for the snow, mane
Freddie G no ho, mane
Mr. lay a motherfucker down on the flo', mane
Thirty-six for the tha-yang
Neutrons get crossed out, niggas can't hang
Better watch what you say, mane
Hundred niggas with me and they all on the same thang

[Hook x4]

// I Seen A Man Die //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Ten bullets in his ass, hit the gas
Ten deep on enemy turf, me and the homies 'bout to mash
Where that glass? Glock was plastic, smoking that gas, puff with the fastest
Bitch get wilding, Gangsta Island, Gary
Smiling in my casket with my eyes wide open
I'ma make my enemy look me straight in my face before they closing
I'ma pierce right through his soul and take control of his emotions
Let it haunt you in your dreams
Bitch kill you, kiss your mama, just like Bishop did Raheem
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
Over a Georgetown Starter jacket and some new Jordan 5s
Blessed in this shit, blessed in this shit, question is, will I survive?
Laid out with a hot gun smoking, on his own blood choking, Gangsta Gibbs, bitch

[Hook x3: Freddie Gibbs and Lil' Sodi]
Before I seen a nigga cry, I seen a young nigga die
(Gotta live my life)

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Eight, nine geekers, make 'em fiend for a piece of crack
Got ten, eleven youngsters in my kitchen, watch me teach 'em that
You call that reaching back? You call that building up?
Fried bologna and a cracker, that was the meal for us
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I, born and die a sinner, but
Blessings over bullets, I pray the Lord deliver
Gibbs, I'm gangbanging, caine slanging

[Hook x3]

Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact
Four, five niggas smoking weed in my Cadillac
Six, seven straps with the beam, that's a matter of fact

[Outro: Lil' Sodi]
Lil' Sodi, Gangsta Gibbs, ESGN nigga
Real niggas
Fucked with him since day one, nigga
Gangsta Gibbs
Living our life in this cold world, nigga
Take a slug, and still at this shit, nigga
You already know, Lil' Sodi
All the neighbors know, L.A
Gibbs, love you 'til the end, nigga
You my bro
You already know
Love you homie

// Have U Seen Her //

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
I got pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Looking for that white bitch, cocaina have you seen her?
I got dope in my two-liter
Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers
Just a young nigga 'bout my mail
Steady tryna work this yayo
Summertime, can't do jail
Money in the safe make bail
Got these pussy ass niggas might tell
Pussy ass niggas might hate
Spoonfeed niggas, no way
Bring it on down, we straight
I got beaucoup pounds of keisha
Dope house full of geekers
Heroin for your needle
All-white cocaina

Pimp C in my speaker
Cluckheads on my line, man I should take shit back to beepers

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]

[Verse 2: Skrewface]
I got pounds of keisha
Keys of the coca
Voted number one D-Boy by the fiends and the smokers
Dope house full of cluckers and the feds trying to scope us
Still got to get that guap, man fuck the cops, I got that blow
Drank by the pint, what you sipping, nigga pour up
Drugs on deck, I'll never run out, what the fuck is a drought, nigga hold up
Anything you want I got more of
And I keep that thing cause ain't no love
I stay ready for the jack boys, how you want to act boy
Get your little bitch ass tore up
Anything you want I got more of
And I keep that thing cause ain't no love
I stay ready for the jack boys, how you want to act, boy
Get your little bitch ass tore up
I got a hundred rounds in my heater
Dope house full of geekers
And they lined up 'round the corner cause they know my price is cheaper

[Hook x4: Freddie Gibbs]
