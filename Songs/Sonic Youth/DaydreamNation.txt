// Teenage Riot //

[Kim]

You're it

No, you're it

Hey, you're really it

You're it

No I mean it, you're it


Say it

Don't spray it

Spirit desire (face me)

Spirit desire (don't displace me)

Spirit desire

We will fall


Miss me

Don't dismiss me


Spirit desire


Spirit desire [x3]

We will fall

Spirit desire

We will fall

Spirit desire [x3]

We will fall

Spirit desire

We will fall

[Thurston]

Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather

And what's a man do to but work out whether it's true?

Looking for a man with a focus and a temper

Who can open up a map and see between one and two


Time to get it

Before you let it

Get to you


Here he comes now

Stick to your guns

And let him through


Everybody's coming from the winter vacation

Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you

You come running in on platform shoes

With Marshall stacks

To at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes

I know it's someone I knew


Teenage riot in a public station

Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you


Now I see it

I think I'll leave it out of the way

Now I come near you

And it's not clear why you fade away


Looking for a ride to your secret location

Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation, for you

Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'

And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now


It better work out

I hope it works out my way

'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head

Takes a teen age riot to get me out of bed right now


You better look it

We're gonna shake it

Up to him


He acts the hero

We paint a zero

On his hand


We know it's down

We know it's bound too loose

Everybody's sound is round it

Everybody wants to be proud to choose

So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather

You're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze


It's time to go round

A one man showdown

Teach us how to fail


We're off the streets now

And back on the road

On the riot trail

// Silver Rocket //

[Thurston]

Snake in it

Jack into the wall

TV amp on fire

Blowin' in the hall

Gun yr. sled

Close yr. peeping toms

Turbo organizer

Crankin' on the knob


You got it

Yeh ride the silver rocket

Can't stop it

Burnin hole in yr pocket


Hit the power

Psycho helmets on

You got to splice yr. halo

Take it to a moon

Nymphoid clamor

Fuelling up the hammer

You got to fake out the robot

And pulse up the zoom


You got it

Yeh ride the silver rocket

Can't stop it

Burnin hole in yr pocket


Can't forget the flashing

Can't forget the smashing

The sending and the bending

The ampisphere re-entry

You gotta have the time

Got a letter in your mind

Gotta heart injection

That you got yourself a line


You got it

Yeh ride the silver rocket

Can't stop it

Burnin hole in yr pocket

// The Sprawl //

[Kim]

To the extent that I wear skirts

And cheap nylon slips

I've gone native

I wanted to know the exact dimension of hell

Does this sound simple?

Fuck you! Are you for sale?

Does 'Fuck you' sound simple enough?

This was the only part that turned me on

But he was candy all over


Come on down to the store

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more


I grew up in a shotgun row

Sliding down the hill

Out front were the big machines

Steel and rusty now I guess

Outback was the river

And that big sign down the road

That's where it all started


Come on down to the store

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

Come on down to the store

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

Come on down to the store

You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

You can buy some more, more, more, more

// 'Cross The Breeze //

[Kim]

Let's go walking on the water

Come all the way please

I wanna know

Should I stay or go?


No need to be scared

Let's jump into the day

I wanna know

I think I oughta go


Close your eyes and make believe

You can do whatever you please

I wanna know

I think I better go


Let's go walkin on water

Now you think I'm Satan's daughter

I wanna know

Please let me go!


Just too quick

Now I think I'm gonna be sick

I wanna know

Should I stay or go?


I'm trying for the future

It's funny that way

I wanna know

I wanna know!


I took a look into the hate

It made me feel very up to date

I wanna know

Should I stay or go?


Hold me tight, down on my knees

So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze

I wanna know

I wanna know!


I wanna know

Should I stay or go?


Burning 'cross the breeze

Burning 'cross the breeze

Blowing 'cross the breeze

// Eric's Trip //

[Lee]

Hatred

I hate the past


I can't see anything at all, all I see is me

That's clear enough

And that's whats important, to see me


My eyes can focus

My brain is talking

Looks pretty good to me

My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful

Looks pretty good to me


Sometimes I speak

Tonight there's nothing to say

Sometimes we freak

And laugh all day


Hold these pages up to the light

See the jacknife inside of the dream

A railroad runs through the record stores at night

Coming in for the deep freeze


Mary: a simple word, are you there in the country?

Yr eyes so full, yr head so tight

Can't you hear me?

Remember our talk

That day on the phone?

I was the door, and you were the station

With shattered glass and miles between us

We still flew away in the conversation


My cup is full, and I feel okay

The world is dull, but not today


She think's she's a goddess

She says she talks to the spirits

I wonder if she can talk to herself?

If she can bear to hear it?


This is Eric's trip

We've all come to watch him slip

He's slipping all the way to Texas

Can you dig it?


(Eric says "The sky is blue...")

I see with a glass eye

The pavement view

A shadow forming, across the fields rushing

Thru me to you


We tore down the world, and put up four walls

I breathe in the myth

I'm over the city, fucking the future

I'm high and inside yr kiss


We can't see clear

But what we see is a alright

We make up what we can't hear

And then we sing all night


Scattered pages and shattered lights

A jacknife and a dream

There's something moving over there on the right

Like nothing I've never seen

// Total Trash //

[Thurston]

It start at the top

Now it's spiralling down

Works best when it's lost

Diggin' under the ground


Never mind it now

We can bring it back

It's total trash

And it's a natural fact

That I'm not no cow


It's never the same

It's more than a game

Can't take it away

Can't kill all the shame


It's a guilty man

That increased the crack

It's total trash

Sack 'em on the back

With a heavy rock


There he goes again

Magic monkey friend

Can I love the time

That he seems to spend

With all the kids in town


It start at the top

Now it's spiralling down

Works best when it's lost

Diggin' under the ground


Never mind it now

We can bring it back

It's total trash

And it's a natural fact

That I'm not no cow

// Hey Joni //

[Lee]

Hey Joni put it all behind you

Hey Joni now I've put it all behind me too

These times can't add up

Yr life is such a mess

Forget the past, and just say yes


Tell me Joni, am I the one

To see you through?

In this broken town can you still jack in

And know what to do?

I remember our youth, our high ideals

I remember you were so uptight

That time in the trees, we broke that vice

We took some steps and now

We can't think twice


Tell me Joni, am I right by you?

Tell me how yr gonna lose this hard luck?

Hey Joni, when will all these dreams come true?

You'd better find a way

To climb down off that truck


Shots ring out from the center of an empty field

Joni's in the tall grass

She's a beautiful mental jukebox

A sailboat explosion

A snap of electric whipcrack


She's not thinking about the future

She's not spinning her wheels

She doesn't think at all about the past

She thinking long and hard

About that high wild sound

And wondering will it last?


Kick it


Hey Joni, put it all behind you

There's something turning, Joni, turning right to you

My head burns, but I know you'll speak the truth, hey!

Hey Joni, put it all behind you

Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too

Forget the future

These times are such a mess

Tune out the past, and just say yes


It's 1963

It's 1964

It's 1957

It's 1962


Put it all behind you

Now it's all behind you

// Providence //

[Mike Watt]

"Watt Here! I'm downstairs from your window... if you're up...

Pub 'phone booth... if you're up...(I get tense) [Beep]"

[Mike Watt]

"Thurston! Watt! Thurston! I think it's ten thirty, we're calling

From Providence, Rhode Island. Did you find your shit? You gotta

Watch the motin' Thurston, your fuckin' memory just goes out tha window.

We couldn't find it in the van at all, we wonderin' if you looked in

That trash can. When we threw out that trash, man, was the bag in

Your hand, did you dump it? Call later. Bye."

// Candle //

[Thurston]

I see a dog star divin' at his magic, snatchin'

Keeps me up awake go crystal cracking

I can't wait

I can't stay, a candle

Gotta change my mind before it burns out


I'm the Cocker on the rock

Wind is whipping through my stupid mop


I see a falling snowgirl walking Broadway

Turns the corner at 14th and I know there's no way

It's alright

It's alight candle

And I know she'll be okay by Sunday


I'm the Cocker on the rock

Humming bash starts shining

In your electric clock


It's safe to say, candle

Tonight's the day, candle

It's alright now, candle

The wind's away, candle

Never thought I'd see a dog star falling


I'm the Cocker on the rock

Wind is whipping through my stupid mop

// Rain King //

[Lee]

Rain King ensures there's nowhere to go

It's jet stream, daydream, cocksure hard luck show

His lips a fountain

His daylight sparks

He's a shotgun, schoolyard, street-wise, white-hot kid

Little whipcream, phone call, breakdown, Rain King fist

His mind a countdown

His daydream sparks


I need three years to clear these thoughts, hey

I like to say I knew one true thing

It feels like years and all I've done is fought

And not turned up, anything


Little black, take roll and roll, over my bed

I'm waiting here for, some reality crease

There's one big deadend, in my head

And not a moment of peace


Crossfire, Rain King, with his cadillac, kid

Marries every dictionary from his chain-yard bliss

His lips a fountain

His daylight sparks

He's got a shot in his kick forging the real, when

He's a steel drum, wedding ring, Pontiac door knob ten

His mind a countdown

His daylight sparks


Hung up on a speed king nation, caught up on a nail

Hanging tight with time, at least, a little while

Your sister is a beauty when she's naked, like my kid

I hear this world, cool world, dreaming of a peaceful kiss

// Kissability //

[Kim]

Look into my eyes, don't you trust me

Yr so good you could go far

I'll put you in a movie, don't you want to

You could be a star

You could go far

You've got twistability

You fly hard, don't you wanna

You've got kissability

You could be a star, it ain't hard


Yr driving me crazy, I feel so sick

Yr driving me crazy, give us a kiss


Look into my eyes, don't you trust me

Yr so soft, you make me hard

I'll put you on a movie, don't you wanna

You could be a star, you could go far

You've got kissability

You sigh hard, don't you wanna

You've got twistability

You could be a star, it ain't hard


Yr driving me crazy, you smell so sick

I feel so tired, you made me sick

Yr driving me crazy, if I feel so sick

Yr driving me crazy, if I feel so sick


Look into my eyes, don't you dis' me

You're so good, you could go far

I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna

You could be a star, you could go far

You've got twistability

You fly hard, don't you wanna

You've got kissability

You could be a star, it ain't hard


You're driving me crazy, I feel so sick

You're driving me crazy, give us a kiss

// Trilogy //

[The Wonder]

[Thurston]

See flashing eyes

They're flashing cross to me

Burnin up the sky

Sunshinin to me

Yr locus crown

Copkillin heartbeat

Head's lookin down

Bowin out to the street


I'm just walking around

Yr city is a wonder town


Lips red to white

Lips green in blacked night

Yr spirit flares

Flarin up leonine


I'm just walking around

Yr city is a wonder town


Transmitter rhyme

Transmitter all the time

Lookin up to the sky

I'm seeing ghosts flyin


I'm just walkin around

Yr city is a wonder town


I think I been there once before

Something tells me there's so much more

She's back in town to even the score

Time to go


See flashing eyes

They're flashing 'cross to me

Burnin' up the sky

Sunshining into me

Your locus crown

Cop-killin' heartbeat

Head's lookin' down

Bowin' out, to the street


I'm just walkin' around

Your city is a wonder town

[Hyperstation]

[Thurston]

Falling out of sleep, I hit the floor

Put on some rock tee and I'm out with the door

From Bowery to Broome to Greene, I'm a walking lizard

Last night's dream was a talking baby lizard


All comin' from hu-man imagination

Day dreaming days in a daydream nation


Smashed-up against a car at three A.M.

Kids just up for basketball, beat me in my head

There's bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped

I've totaled another amp, I'm calling in sick


It's an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation

Day dreaming days in a daydream nation

[Eliminator Jr.]

[Kim]

Kids cruise away, pack of chickenshits

This guy is ours, dark stains on his pants

Enough to make a butcher out of the bone

Take a walk in the park? Shit, yeah!


A poor boy, a rich boy

A poor rich boy coming right through me

Rich boy, poor boy

Poor rich boy coming right through me
