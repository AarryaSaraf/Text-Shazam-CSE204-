Album: AreWeThere

// Afraid Of Nothing //

You told me the day
That you show me your face
We'd be in trouble for a long time

I can't wait
Til we're afraid
Of nothing
I can't wait
Til we hide
From nothing
Nothing
And you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you
To be afraid of nothing

Turning my way
You show me your face
We've known each other for a long time

I can't wait
Til we're afraid
Of nothing
I can't wait
Til we hide
From nothing
Nothing
And you decide
You throw me a lame "wait shit out"
You're a little late
I need you
To be afraid of nothing

I need you
To be afraid of nothing

// Taking Chances //

Turn on the charm
Call to response now
Sitting on the porch
Looking for a way out

Touched on me deep
That's why I'm still here
Why do we think that we've no plight?

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you
Remember?

In the dark
On the way out
It's even enough sounds
It's the combination that takes emotions
Why don't we go now?
No need to think on our own now about it

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you

When you love all of you, they know all of you
Be alone and take, and you break for your sake
About to leave, about to leave

Even I've taken my chances
Even I've taken my chances on you

// Your Love Is Killing Me //

It's understood
You'll be a man by the time I see you
We've been through better days
And you've tasted all my pain

Break my legs so I won't walk to you
Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you
Burn my skin so I can't feel you
Stab my eyes so I can't see
You like it when I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
Your love is killing me

Try to tell you this when I'm sober, how I feel about loving you
Try to remember all the turn of events
Being led by our own fantasies, fantasies

Break my legs so I won't walk to you
Cut my tongue so I can't talk to you
Burn my skin so I can't feel you
Stab my eyes so I can't see
You like it when I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
When our minds become diseased

There he let it go, his temper, standing there
See her with his gun and he, steals love so he can feel alive
Everyone's knees knockin' at the fear of love
Taste blood
Everybody needs to feel

Break my legs so I won't run to you
Steal my soul so I am one with you
From a distance I am on to you
But I'll stab my eyes out so I can't see
You like it
When I let you walk over me
You tell me that you like it
You love me as you torture me
You told me that you liked it
But I won't let you see
All that I can do is what I can
With this pain you've given me
With this pain you've given me
Your love is killing me
Yes all your pain is killing me

// Our Love //

You say I am genuine
I see your backhand again
I'm a sinner, I have sinned
We're a half mast flag in wind

It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love
It's our love

At the bottom of a well
I'm reliving my own hell
Someone throws the ladder down
Still don't know what I have found

In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love
In our love

It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love
It's all love

// Tarifa //

Hit the ground
The yard, I found something
I could taste your mouth
Shut the door
Now in the sun tanning

You were so just
Looking across the sky

Can't remember
I can't recall, no
I can't remember anything at all

We skipped the sunrise
Looking across the grass
Said he wanted
And not that I'm every
It's the same, I could mean you were right

Everyone else
Hasn't a chance, don't
Fail me now
Open arms, rest

Let's run under
Cursing myself at night
Slow it was 7
I wish it was 7 all night

Tell me when
Tell me when is this over?
Chewed you out
Chew me out when I'm stupid
I don't wanna
Everyone else pales
Send in the owl
Tell me I'm not a child

You summon
Forget about everyone else
Fall away somehow

To figure it out

// I Love You But I'm Lost //

One, two, three

You read the answers by the shadows on the wall
We could be great
Drive myself crazy with mistakes
You know Iâm better everyday

Tell me thereâs something I can change 
Recall I know what a sanctuary is
Help me deserve you, seeing me praise
You love me but youâll change

Disappointed in a lover 
Because thereâs the only way
To know somebody in and out after a while 
Itâs all a challenge

Come in here and be yourself again
I love you but Iâm not somebody who take shots
See me after I recoil 
Iâm better than I know 
Thereâs room to grow

Tear stains on the last page
Better leave 'em
Time will tell and Iâll be back
Tear stains I believe that Iâm in Houston 
I can read my lines
Most of all I find it strange 
I believe them

Turn me into something great
You know that thatâs the only way
Promises that we forgot
I suppose that we will always 

Letâs turn it into something we can change 
I love you but Iâm lost 
Between the pain and cost
I hold myself alive 
I love you but Iâm lost 
I love you but Iâm lost 
I love you but Iâm lost 
I love you but Iâm lost 

I love you but Iâm lost 
I love that thereâs no cross

// You Know Me Well //

Everyone will go with you
Listen for the way out as you
Cut me to the chase til I'm
On the other side and when
It all comes out
We're as empty as a brick house that we
Built without the sides

Everyone is crazy with their own life
Lies in existential you ever want to find your way out
Turn into yourself again and reach on out
To become your true self

You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking

All the skies are fallin and the sun is movin up and down
Even when you're in a dark way
Some decisions shield you from the positivity until
You reach out to me
You say why you hate it as you pry your way in
I need another investigative mind
Tell me that you're injured, yourself, and you've been healing
And I will see this through

You know me well
You show me hell when I'm looking
And here you are
Looking
I told you then
I'd hold you when you need it
And there you are
Looking
Away

You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well
You know me well

// Break Me //

No show
Isn't that how it goes?
No show
He makes
He's making room for me in the city
He makes

He can break me
With one hand to my, head
Go in dark, dear
Dissipate my fears, letting me, in
He let's me in

He knows
That I love him, I know he is home
He knows
Sirens
Sirens are far from me
Safe and alone

He can make me
Move into a city on my knees
He can take in everything
Hoping he let's me in
I, I let you in

I am writing about him home
I am, I am writing a song for him

He can break me
With one hand to my, head
He can make me move into a city
Taking me as I am
As he let's me in

// Nothing Will Change //

Maybe something will change
Maybe something will change

Remember when you saw me on the street
And then you looked in my eyes?
You helped me with the tire change
It had been a while and I thought that you'd forgot about me
I never could have forgotten you

I will reach you
I will reach you
I will meet you, on your street
I won't let you down

Maybe something will change
Maybe something will change

A couple years later when I say you making western moves
And pal-in' 'round while I still saw in you 
You always believed in me and I always believed in you
Let's not turn the page

I will reach you
I will reach you
I will meet you, on your street
I won't let you down

I will meet you
I will meet you
I will meet you, on your street
I don't wanna let you down

Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will change
Nothing will change

// I Know //

Now I turn into a lover on the side
I cannot tell the poet eye apart from mine
And now you see me with a tear fall on my right
I know you know

You see me turn around and try to hide my sigh
I know the ancient melodies will come at night
I sing about my fear and love and what it brings
I know, I know

And then you push me out
And then you push me out
I know, I know
And then you disappear because you can't fight fear
I know, I know

I sit inside a box and try to find my thoughts
With cups upon my ears so I can shut it out
I see you listen to my body and say
I know, I know
I know it's hard to find out what I'm not
I know, I know

And here we are apart, but here together are
Our hearts that now beat for each other, although far
I hear your voice and I know what it calls
I know, I know

Hold on, hold on
I want you
Hold on, hold on
All I ever wanted was you

// Every Time The Sun Comes Up //

Pace mine for you
Hold my horses, patient
Hey man, tricks can't wait to hear my emotions

Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

People say I'm a one-hit wonder
But what happens when I have two?
I washed your dishes, but I shit in your bathroom

Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Even when the sun comes up, I'm in trouble

We broke your glasses, but covered our asses
Take time silently, feel real room high five

When every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Yeah, every time the sun comes up, I'm in trouble
Imagine when
Every time the sun comes up, I see double
