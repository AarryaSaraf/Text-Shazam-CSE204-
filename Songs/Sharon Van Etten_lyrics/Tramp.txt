// Warsaw //

You, when you listen
In the color of sorrow
You're over me
You, with eyes through
Leaning forward not giving in wholely
You, you're something
You mean something
Genuinely showing me
Genuinely open to you

Here, sing to yourself
Tell me you want to be shown or
You only listen to an endless sea you want to be over
He is over you
He is over you
I want to be over you
I want to show you
Pull me over you
Arms all over you
I want to show you
I love you silently

// Give Out //

There were your eyes in the dark of the room,
The only ones shining,
The only set I had met in years.
It's not because I always look down.
It might be I always look out.
It might be I always look out.
I am biting my lip
As confidence is speaking to me.
I loosen my grip from my palm,
Put it on your knee.
In my way,
I say
You're the reason why I'll move to the city or
Why I'll need to leave.
You're the reason why I'll move to the city or
Why I'll need to leave.

There was your breath on the back of my neck,
The only one holding,
The only one I had felt in years.
It's not because I always hold on,
It might be I always hold out.
It might be I always hold out.
I am biting my lip
As confidence is speaking to me.
I loosen my grip from my palm,
Put it on your knee.
In my way,
I say
You're the reason why I'll move to the city or
Why I'll need to leave.
You're the reason why I'll move to the city or
Why I'll need to leave.

So what's with the eyes in the back of the room?
The only ones trying.
The only ones I have let in years.
It's not because I always give up,
It might be I always give out.
It might be I always give out.
It might be I always give out.
It might be I always give out.

// Serpents //

It was a close call
Sitting in the back of the room
With a bowl you had owned
But they didn't know

Close in on my black eye
I feel safe at times
Certain emblems
Tell me it's time

Serpents in my mind
Looking for your crimes
Everything changes
I don't want mine to this time

You enjoy sucking on dreams
So I will fall asleep
With someone other than you
I had a thought
You would take me seriously
And listen on

Serpents in my mind
I am searching for your crimes
Everything changes in time
You'll stay frozen in time

Collaging controlling minds
You hold the mirror well
To everybody else

Serpents in my mind
Trying to forgive your crimes
Everything changes in time
I hope he changes this time

// Kevin's //

True.
Tell everyone you know.
It's all we ask.
If it were all up to me, I would say
Come up to these truths instead.

You dig your own grave.
You dig your own grave.

Buried in masculine pain all the time.
Envy all less, we know.
Crazy. basic.
In your own breath, you cough.

Ooh, in your own breath.
Ooh, in your own breath.

Take on yourself.
It's the only way I will breathe.
Temples... temples...
In your own breath.

Ooh, in your own breath.
Ooh, in your own breath for me.

// Leonard //

There he goes
He finally closed the door
I turn the lock feeling more confused than before
What gives?
I thought that you would love more
Now you're a coward, sure
Then he rings
Look in his eyes
He loves you

Well, well, I am bad 
Well, well, hell, I am bad 

He's smart
He leaves me wanting more
Knowing that I gave less
And knowing why
Time, time is what I would need
Full of myself indeed
Just walk away
Surprised
He loved you

Well, well, I am bad
Well, well, hell, I am bad at loving

Trust
You know that I trusted you
But I cannot let you do, to just fall in
Try
I wanted to try for you
Wanted to die for you
Dramatic things
The lies
I loved you

Well, well, I am bad
Well, well, hell, I am bad at loving you

Surprised
Just look in my eyes

// In line //

I was a child
I wasn't worried
Tempted in dark
Waiting for love
I was late

Don't let love wait
And don't let love weigh anything
When you were on my side
The world was shitty then
All gray
To my right I look to you
Telling me what to do

Tumbling right into ghosts
It's not such a sin
Thought you should know
I was just a child then
Standing in my own line

In line
In line
In line

In line
In line
In line

See the light in line
Distant light in line

And now it's coming through
It's coming through
It's coming through
It's coming through

Even in line
I wait for another
Don't you?

// All I Can //

The sun is at stake
And I'm at your window
Beyond all sleep
And I can't speak

In all Tokyo
Translate memories
That I cannot free
But what will it take?

We all make mistakes
We all try to free
The sighs of the past
We don't want to last

Need love erase
To let out my mind
Wanting to love
As new as I can

Wanting to show
I want my scars to help and heal
How much you wanted?
So much you found

Try not to beg
Too much to be
Calling my heart
And know you are real
But my memory steals every moment I can feel
What will it take?

We all make mistakes
Even though I try to stand
Even though it's slowly
I do all I can
But who is my man?

The memory or you?
The love or the due?
To carry a face
I cannot retrace
I do all I can
We all make mistakes

// We Are Fine //

Trying hard to breathe
Head between my knees
Take my hand and squeeze
Say I'm alright

Whisper in my ear
Happy you are here
Everything seems clear
And we're alright
We're alright

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight
You are walking in my guided light
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm alright, I'm alright
Say I'm alright, I'm alright

It's okay to feel
Everything is real
Nothing left to steal
'Cause we're alright, we're alright

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight
You are walking in my guided light
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm alright, I'm alright
Say I'm alright, I'm alright
Say I'm alright, I'm alright

// Magic Chords //

You're talking too loud
Won't you walk over, whisper, motion hands or bat a lash
You gotta see there's too many eyes

You're walking too fast
Why the hurry, let me pace myself, no need to run a lap
You gotta lead, you gotta lead

You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

You hear what I say, when you waltz over, whistle
And you're trying to have your way
You gotta see, you felt the same
You're coming today with a hop in your step
You kind of marvel at yourself
You gotta breathe, you gotta breathe

You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime
You got to lose, you got to lose, you got to lose sometime

Cowardice
You felt it yourself
You're telling lies
You said too much
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose this time
You got nothing to lose, nothing to lose, nothing to lose

// Ask //

Let's find something that can last
Like cigarette ash, the world is collapsing around me
Let's try to do the best we can
I think I need more than the flowers and letters, man

It's not that I don't try, it's that you won't again
And it hurts too much to laugh about it
Yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it

Hey, please think about it friend
I know you're lonely, I'm here writing in the dark
Just trying to get the balls
But it hurts too much to ask

Dear I Need Someone Who's Lost,
Tell me how not to stop all these tears and fears
So nothing else will drop
So all this pain will stop
But if it hurts too much to ask, if it hurts too much to ask

It's not that I don't cry
It's that I have to hide, yeah 
It's that I have to hide so I won't be there to ask
So I won't be there to ask
So I won't be there to ask
No, I won't be there to ask

And it hurts too much to laugh about it
Yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it
Yes, it hurts too much to laugh about it, man

// I'm Wrong //

Come home in the morning
Drive me to work, 
tell me I'm worth all the miles
that you put on your car.
I'll tell you I'm fine 
Without you for a little while and then I'll work inside.
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me it hasn't been that long.

"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad 
to believe in any song you sing" -
Tell me this even though you can't believe it.
Tell me I'm wrong to make it feel right again.

Stay home 
At night and read a book and finish songs
That I hum along to all the time with you
but I don't have words to say

Tell me I'm right. 
Tell me I'm funny, 
Even when I'm not.
It rings and I feel your sum in the odds.

"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad 
to believe in any song you sing" -
Tell me this even though you can't believe it.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me you're lonely.
Tell me this song is not about you only 
And I'm a lie.

You know you've been gone long.
"It's bad, it's bad, it's bad 
to believe in any song you sing" -
Tell me this even though you can't believe it.

Tell me I'm wrong.
Please tell me I'm wrong.
Tell me I'm wrong.
Please tell me I'm wrong

// Joke Or A Lie //

What should I do?
I am lost
Tell me to leave the next time
I'm in front of you

I can't relate
Chip on your shoulder
How do you deal with that weight?
My hands are getting tired

Call it a joke or a lie
Call it a joke or a lie
Put your coat on
Then believe me
I try

Let us escape
For a night
Breathe the silence
I am alone
But I am alone
In this room with you

Call it a joke or a lie
Call it a joke or a lie
Put your coat on
Then believe me
I tried

// This Is Too Right //

This is too right
You have mistaken me for another life
This is too right
You have mistaken me for
Someone you used to like

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right

This is too right
My hands are shaking mine
It's like we never met
I'll sleep til 10, til 12 or 2:30
It really just depends

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
Too right, too right

This is too right
I can count on one hand
Your misconception rights
This is too right
I want to correct you
You call me every time you need rules

It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
It's too right, it's too right
Too right, too right
Too right
