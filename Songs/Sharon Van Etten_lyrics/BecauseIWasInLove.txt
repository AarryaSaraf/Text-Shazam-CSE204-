Album: BecauseIWasInLove

// I Wish I Knew //

I wish I knew what to do with you,
But the truth is I ain't got a clue,
Do you? Do You?

I wish I had an idea of what I need,
But we, oh we, can't know and that's okay,
That's okay.

I wish you'd understand,
I wish that I could know,
The truth is I have no idea.

I wish we could just run around
And only worry about right now,
I hate to admit it but I don't know shit
And neither do you, do you, do you,

And that is good enough 
For me, for you, for now, 
As long as we can talk about it.

// Consolation Prize //

I came to you, 
My conscience clean,
Blood on my knees.

The moral of the story 
Is don't walk away again.

I called you out,
To see my bow,
Our final scene.

The moral of the story
Is don't look away again,
To find a better conversation.

I saw you there,
Your friends aware,
Without a care.

The moral of the story
Is don't lie to me again
To find a better conversation,
So I can be your consolation prize

You ran away
To stand your ground,
Look what I found.

The moral of the story
Is don't walk away again,
To find a better conversation,
So I can be your consolation prize.
To find a better conversation,
No, I'll never be your consolation prize

// For You //

I was walking up the street
I was thinking about my dreams that might come true
With you

I was whispering in my sleep
All the secrets that I keep I told to you
I do, I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do

I was running home to you
I was hoping that you knew I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
I do, I do
I'd wait for you
But you knew
You knew you knew you knew

// I Fold //

Lately I've seen 
Confidence and grace,
Crawl in a ball 
And fear I've lost my faith.

Broken down.
Thought I was fine, fine fine.
Broken down.

Caught in a rut.
Foot hard to find hold.
For granted your haven,
The basement where I sang. 

Broken down.
Thought I was fine, fine, fine.
Broken down.

Are you losing touch 
Or can't I just find my face?
Wrinkling up 
I know time can't be erased.

Broken down.
Thought I was fine, fine, fine.
Broken down.
Broken down I fold.

// Have You Seen //

Have you seen what I once called my heart?
Have you seen my life that's now falling apart?
Oooh... my life that's now falling apart...

Have you been to what I once called my home?
States away, how could I not feel alone?
Oooh... how could I not feel alone?

Have you heard a heart flies away like a bird,
Runs from the cold, into the arm that will hold?
Oooh... into the arms that will hold.
Into the arms that will hold.

// Tornado //

You never saw me as a reward.
You didn't know he did 
And then you tried to win the bet.
You tripped and fell upon the sword 
That I'd given to you though you never carried.

I'm a tornado. You are the dust, 
You're all around and you're inside.

My eyes get dusty cloudy, 
Just like you wanted...
You were the child 
And I'm the fault.
Why do I fawn upon you?
You are the reason I'm a force.
And when you knew you were you to feel worse.

I'm a tornado. You are the dust 
You're all around and you're inside.

I cannot make you leave your source 
'Cause you make yourself feel like you've got grounding.

I'm a tornado. You are the dust 
You're all around and you're inside.
You are the nature I'm the roar that comes from you.

I'm a tornado. You are the dust 
You're all around and you're inside.
I'm a tornado you are the fences that will fall 
But still surround me.
I'm a tornado.
I'm a tornado.
I'm a tornado.

// Much More Than That //

Please don't take me lightly.
I mean every word.
Whichever way you'd like to place them.

One day I'll be a better writer.
I'll make every face 
That I'll never perfectly phrase.
Ooh... that I'll never perfectly phrase.

You reached for my hand slowly.
I didn't pull away.
We did not have to be lips to face.

My toe hit your toe lightly.
You toe met my heel right back
And I don't think I need much more than that.
Ooh... and I don't think I need much more than that.

You look at me so slyly 
But only when I'm smiling.
Every other time your head looks down.

I sigh and then I frown.
I write this moment down, 
'Cause I cannot paint pictures with my tongue.
Ooh... no I cannot paint pictures with my tongue.

// Same Dream //

Bet you don't remember how we met.
That's okay it hasn't happened yet.
Although we had the same dream.
Although we had the same dream.

I think I met you when I was sleeping.
'Cause I shook myself awake.
Although we had the same dream.
I know when I go to sleep 
We'll have the same dream.
We'll have the same dream.

Oooh... bet you don't remember how we met.
That's okay it hasn't happened yet 
Although we had the same dream.
I know when I go to sleep 
We'll have the same dream 
'Cause we can still dream.

// Keep //

Keep still so I can find you at your whim.
Breathe slowly so I can breathe with you.
Ooh... ooh... 

Leave me alone, 
We all want to feel at home.
Find me sleeping, 
My inner dialogue's a drone.
Keep... 

Don't cry for me, 
I can't either.
I can't weep.
Remember these moments, 
They're all we have 
And all I can keep.
Caught in a lie I want 
You to keep me to yourself.

Keep running deep under my skin I want to shed.
Don't keep it in keep it on the thinnest of all threads-
And I want to break you no no... 
Ooh...

// It's Not Like //

Take both my feet.
Tie them.
Throw me over.
Will I still float?
Will my heart sink?
Why have I held on so long?
I still don't know.
And it's not like I have anyone to show 
Or do I want to?

These arms this heart these eyes 
Have seen almost everything.
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.

Take both my hands.
Tie them behind my back 
To keep me from holding from holding from holding.
But that's so unlike myself.
And it's not like I have anyone to hold 
Or do I want to?

These eyes this heart these arms 
Have held almost anything 
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.
Oooh...

Why do I need to love someone?
It's like I was born not out of legs 
But I was born of arms.
And it's not like I have anyone to love.
Should I want to?

These eyes these arms this heart 
Has loved almost everything 
But not you. But not you.
But I want to.
Oooh...

// Holding Out //

I was warned
I your humble Alamo kind of world
Around you and all you are
I was fooled by the way you take me seriously
Even when I'm joking

Damn damn damn damn 
I'm not tired and I'm tired
I'm not calling out 
Cross the street I was holding out
Holding out cross the table
I was holding out
Trying to find a lover like that holding out
Like the wind I was holding out
Staying still hoping no one else would see me
Hoping calm replacing silent trying tongues
Do I need a reason to hold you now
Cause I'd hold you now
Yeah I would hold you now
One night and all I need is one more day
Holding out something that feels okay

And the right thing to do is wait
Holding out
Holding out
Holding out for you
I am strange, believed in fairy tales at a young age
Circumstance now I kick my self in the pants
Down the street talk to you, tires screech
Isn't it strange I had a chance now were holding out
Hoping that the last string won't break
I'm nodding out 
With a smile stuck on my face
And then you came to me in a far away way 
And I'm bring you something I want you to have
It's the biggest part of my heart that I still got
Hoping arms 
Know I'll be holding out
I'll be holding out
Holding out
I'll be holding out
Holding out 
Holding out
Holding out
For you
