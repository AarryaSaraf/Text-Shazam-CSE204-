Album: IDontWantToLetYouDown

// I Don't Want To Let You Down //

When dreams grew black
I didn't want to see the light
Cross through hell in snow
Dreams were gone within yourself
Taught me to know what it's like

Don't shout it, stay
I don't want to let you down
Plead your cause
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down

Decompress and calm your head
Teach you not to rush
Turn them out, to see your words
Trust me, stay and stay

Overboard
I don't want to let you down
Overboard
I don't want to let you down
Crazy hell
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down
I don't want to let you down

// Just Like Blood //

In the ocean
Waves all around
And they're smashing down
Take my hand, shut your eyes
And hope you remember

You like the position
Watch that change 'fore we drown
We ask ourselves, where we are now
Who we are, what that means

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood

Disappear when the sun goes down
Acid spills as you breathe
Turn around, stare at the wall
Bone to my mouth, and read it out

You shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Shut me off, just like a gun
Then you run, just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood
Just like blood

// I Always Fall Apart //

Where have you been?
Where have you been?
I've covered the streets
Recovered into everlasting leaps

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am
You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am

You turn me in to a museum
You kept me from the growing weeds
When all you wanted was the best
From me, that is the test
Can you keep me from?
You can't explain me

You know it's always been my heart
You know I always fall apart
It's not my fault, it's just my flaw
It's who I am

I can't believe the way I've been
I've been resentful and I've sinned
I need you now just as a friend
I need a hand held, not a pushing
I need a way to help me to stand only to crash
I know who I am and what I've done
Don't know what I'd do but when
I look to my side I'll be a friend
Where have you been?

// Pay My Debts //

It took me years to find
True mind at peace
And now you treat me like
They approve me
You're my poem, yes you know
Yet you stole my way
Just to know this, you told me
You were late
When you would call, I would hold
And I still remain
Then you led me to believe that's what you wanted

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

True love, but I'd see you
Treat me more like you
And I'd try to heal it
But I feel so thrown back
Take my hand, in the cold
In the snow, but you do not break
But they told you, convinced you
Think I'd play
But I know myself better than you do

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

May, May calling slow
Finally in a dress that meant money in the bank
Drinking hard so you can't feel the warmth of the arms
So you dreamt, fade away
Take my hand, I paid my fine
In the park, in the dark, when you said my name
On the bench, when I felt that you smiled
And you said there, that child

Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away
Pay my debts away, pay my debts
Pay my debts away

// Tell Me (Live) //

Woke in a sweat
What I canât forget, and what Iâll never ask to you
Tell me that Iâm something that you just donât know
Tell me that Iâm somewhere you donât want to go
Tell me that Iâm someone you donât want to know
Like the back of your hand
I donât understand 
Undone, disarmed
Well I donât know and you donât mind
This time thereâs no time
Well I donât know and you donât mind

Deep inside of the day, anyone else would fall in your arms
But I do not
Do I, do I, do I want that 
I was something that you just couldnât feel 
I was something that you couldnât feel that was real 
I believed you when you shut your eyes and dreamed a dream without me 
Mmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I donât think about you 
Hmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I donât think about it
Oh oh 

Tears are falling in the underground
Falling into thoughts that turn to colours
The colours are the colours of my thoughts and theyâre painting you 
Sometimes I live my own life, my own life
