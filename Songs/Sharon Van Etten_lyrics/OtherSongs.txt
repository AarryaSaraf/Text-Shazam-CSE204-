// (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love And Understanding? //

As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?

And each time I feel like this inside
There's one thing I wanna know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?

As I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?

So where are the strong?
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony

'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding?

// All Over Again //

Doing it all over again
Prove to me
You're some kind of man
And face it
To have some proof of life

Doing it till I feel again
You will never learn
To withstand
To chase it
Try to understand
Where I end

Every one says they understand
Everyone will do what they can
I've seen it
Imagine the time to
Grow

Every hand you had to extend
I was stepping up and you land
To regress
You can't even
Hold your own weight
And I let you
Do it all over again
Do it all over again

// Beaten Down //

Your big ol' heart takes a lot on
Shoulders the world
It takes a lot to unfold
And you compromise so
Don't try to understand

Your big ol' heart gets beaten down

It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
Don't you hear it beatin' now?

We're dig on life
You try to see her but she wants you back
And you see it all over her face
Our freedom
We breathe in
We have a good life
Then you see her like that

Your big ol' heart gets beaten down

It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
Mmm...

Don't get shot down in the dark alley
Where the air is smoke
And we're so misunderstood

Your big ol' heart gets beaten down

It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down
It ain't beaten down

Don't mean you're beaten now...

// Blue Christmas //

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas

// Do You Realize? //

Do you realize?
That you have the most beautiful face
Do you realize?
We're floating in space
Do you realize?
That happiness makes you cry
Do you realize?
That everyone you know some day will die

And instead of saying all of your goodbyes
Let them know you realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
Realize the sun don't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round

Do you realize?
Do you realize?
That everyone you know someday will die

And instead of saying all of your goodbyes
Let them know you realize that life goes fast
It's hard to make the good things last
Realize the sun don't go down
It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round

Do you realize?
That you have the most beautiful face
Do you realize?

// Dry //

Walking on a cloud of uncertainty
I was something else
Tissues and one hand on my mouse
Waiting for my mom to FaceTime
But then my Wi-Fi cut out

Thinking bout the bad days
And the easy ones
I still feel guilty about
Oh, this cabin fever ain't the same
As when I lived alone

Put my hands
On someone's other line
Hear my voice
Like it was the first time

My tear just dropped
My skin is dry

Another innocent drive
Mysterious time
Another innocent drive
Mysterious time

My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried
My innocence dried

// Femme Fatale //

Here she comes
You better watch your step
She's goin' to break your heart in two, it's true
It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up to just put you down, what a clown

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number thirty-seven, have a look
She's goin' to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you try, you're already beat
She's goin' to play you for a fool, yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
Oh, whoa, whoa

Oh, whoa, whoa

// Hotel 2 Tango //

Tell me why you're leaving
There's a hole in my heart
Thoughts can be deceiving
Am I falling apart?
Should it stops and it starts
Am I breathing?

Turn into the rain
And then I'm walking away
Reaching out to me
When there is nothing to save
What are you doing today?
What are you doing today?

When you go
When you go
Too far
Too much

Everyone is talking
They got nothing to say
Ask me why I'm crying
Why don't you go away?
Tell me when you're gone
When you're gone
Where did you go
When you're gone
Where I go

// I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire //

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't wanna set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just wanna start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down inside of me
Darling, I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, nobody else ain't gonna do

I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just wanna be the one you love
And with your admission, that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal, I'm dreaming of, believe me

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

// Let Go //

Brother's smile
Taking on its own
Identity
Only to then leave it behind

Foreign light in the afternoon

Held by what-be-nots
Stay until remembered
Here I'm standing
Ripped apart by albatross
Hanging by a thread

What's in a name?
What's in a name?

Down on the other side
I'm almost out of sight
Looking up to let go
Now I'm letting go
Now I'm letting go
Now I'm letting go

Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
Let it go (Let him go)
...

// Like I Used To //

Will the marker stain the skin?
Stole the dress I saw you in
Now nothing comes to mind
Saw a life as override
One more session overdrive
The ceiling is the roof

Change address and draw a line
Show my friends the silver line
Call my family just to know they're there

Sleepin' in late like I used to
Crossing my fingers like I used to
Waiting inside like I used to
Avoiding big crowds like I used to

Crawl the field and let you in
Brand my heart I found you in
To say nothing's more apart
Will my lover be there, stay
Follow them to less the pain
The ceiling must be wrong

Well, my head's gone today
Sell my past for a way
To sing and have something left to say
Pray my hands, pray my voice
Give the reason, take away
Make believe an order for to stay

Lighting one up like I used to
Dancing all alone like I used to
Giving it up like I used to
Falling in love like I used to

Open my heart like I used to
Making out long like I used to
Holding hands openly, rights to
Taking what's mine like I used to

Like I used to (Like I used to)
Like I used to (Like I used to)

// Not Myself //

Run away with me in July
To the same place and be ourselves
In the ashes of the aftermath, pray

Call me, say you wash away your worry
It's the call that you made out to me
In the ashes of the aftermath, pray

Hey
Tell me something
Is there anything you wouldn't do for me?
I will walk with you
Show my heart believes in something, pray
Courageous and light

Please, darling
Believe in something
I want you to be yourself around me
I know it's too much to take
There's too much at stake
And I want you to be yourself around me

Please
Please

Please, darling
Believe in something
I want you to be yourself around me
I know it's too much to take
There's too much at stake
But I want you to be yourself around me

Praise
Praise
Praise
Take me to the night

// On Your Way Now //

She's not heavy, she's your little everything
On our way to the daylight and all it brings

And I don't mind at all
No, I don't mind at all
(Okay, just a little bit)

On your way, now
On your way, now

She's no trouble, she can travel here with me
I'll share all that I am, and that's a guarantee

And I don't mind at all
No I don't mind at all
(Well okay, just a little bit)

On your way, now
On your way, now

Go on, hit the ground running
Hit the ground running

// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glory streams from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia!
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

// Some Things Last A Long Time //

Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright
Bright as ever
The red is strong, the blue is pure
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
I think about you
Often, often
I won't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

It's funny, but it's true
And it's true, but it's not funny
Time comes and goes, but all the while
I still think of you
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright
Bright as ever
I think we did, I can't forget
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime

// Staring At A Mountain //

It hasn't rained for days
Staring at a mountain out of rage
Hear a bird calling, someone's here
To reach inside my pain
Pain

The leaves are turning in my mind
They haven't fallen and I can't feel time
The wind is capturing me, hair is falling
Covering my eyes
Rise
The wind is turning into movement
And then falling out of time
Time

I am so tired I fell right through
I looked into a darkness no one knew
I'm falling further into something
That I cannot understand

But you understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand
You understand

// Tell Me //

Woke in a sweat
What I canât forget, and what Iâll never ask to
Tell me that Iâm something that you just donât know
Tell me that Iâm somewhere you donât want to go
Tell me that Iâm some place you donât want to know
Like the back of your hand
I donât understand 
Undone, disarmed
Well I donât know and you donât mind
This time thereâs no time
Well I donât know and you donât mind
Deep inside of the day, anyone else would fall in your arms
But I do not
Do I, do I, do I want that 
I was something that you just couldnât feel 
I was something that you couldnât feel that was real 
I believed you when you shut your eyes and dreamed a dream without me 
Mmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I donât think about you 
Hmmmmmmmm
Sometimes I donât think about it
Oh oh 
Tears are falling in the underground
Falling into thoughts that turn to colours
The colours are the colours of my thoughts and theyâre painting you 
Sometimes I live my own life, my own life

// The End Of The World //

Why does the sun go on shining
Why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

// Toyboat //

I'm waiting for a boat to help me out of here - mm
Waiting for a boat to help me out
The boat that reached my shore was a toyboat - mm
Waiting for a boat to help me out

I'm dreaming of a lake I've never seen before - mm
I'm dreaming of a lake I've never seen
The lake I've seen last was a picture lake - mm
Dreaming of a lake I've never seen

You who are
You who are
Help me out, help me out, help me out of here

I'm thinking of a castle on a top a hill - mm
Thinking of a castle on a top a hill
The castle I've been to was full of flies - mm
Thinking of a castle on a top a hill

You who are
You who are
Help me out, help me out, help me out of here

You who are
You who are
Help me out, help me out, help me out of here

// Where Is My Love //

Where is my love, I sing
What I'll never understand
Something I thought I held
But it fell, it fell
It fell

Oh well as men say
Oh well as men say
I'll hold it again

I sing, I sing, I sing
What I don't understand
Of things I held in my hand that fell
Ooh as the men say
Oh well, does the man say
I'll love again

Where is my love
That I sing
I don't understand
I, thought I held in my hand
But it fell

Ooh, it fell and it fell
Ooh, it fell and it fell
And now I sing ooh well
