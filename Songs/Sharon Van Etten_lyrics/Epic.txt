Album: Epic

// A Crime //

To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime
To admit I'm still in love with you, after all this time
I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die
Seduce me with your charms until I'm drunk on them
Go home and drink in bed and never let myself be in love like that again

Light a cigarette and think of you and walk away
Turning all the words around in my head I won't say
Because of all these triangles and squares
The memory we seem to share replays a distant love that plays my records on

Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again

To say the words I want to say to you would be a lie
By the time I get the courage I am drunk and you are tired
Alone in this basement where I will write these songs
Of things I'll never say to you again and you know why

Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again

// Peace Signs //

I woke up I was already me
I was somewhat afraid I was something
Peace Signs
I told you I could no longer see
I was right in the fire I was on my knees
Peace Signs
Take it back I felt no longer used
I had nothing to do I was so you
Peace sign I was already you
Peace sign I was already you
Peace sign I was already you
No lie I was no longer wrong
I had questions in mind why you were strong
Hit back it was already too
Hit back it was already soon
Hit back it was already too...
I still dream that I think of you
In the calm of the night and I don't know what to do
Peace Signs
When I woke up I was already me
And I am not afraid I am something 
Peace Signs

// Save Yourself //

I want every town, I need you to know
There's nothing left to sell me, I'm broke

I just want these holes for when I try to run
For no reason, or so I'm told

Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Ancient in one long, incidental month
You had a bad day, I want home

You still make me smile, as much as I am reeling
It has been a while, please don't make me show I'm not your gal

Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Just like everyone else
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Try and make me feel like I'm your number one
Every other one, well, shit, get real

Know you're balding still, you're older than you feel
Think a little harder, a little modest and humble be
I won't wait around

Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Don't you think I know you're only trying to save yourself
Just like everyone else
You're just like everyone else
You're just like everyone else
You're just like everyone else

// Dsharpg //

Everyone think I'm a liar
Wading on the edge of fire with you 
In the hour of questions I wonder who-
Who?
Why do they want? Who are we all?
What do we do? What do we do?
Everyone says I'm a fool to believe in that
Everyone says I'm a fool to believe in that
Following blind. Following blind.
Following who?
Who?
Why do they mind? Why do they mind?
What do they do? What do they do?
Everyone says you're a fool to believe in that
Everyone says you're a fool to believe in that
Covering eyes, covering eyes, Covering who-
Who? Following blind, covering eyes...
What do they do?! What do they do?!
So what if we care we're all fools who believe in that?
So what if we care we're all fools who believe in that?
Believing truth, believing truth, Believing who-
Who?
Following blind, following blind
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!
What if I do?!

// Don't Do It //

Said you need to do it 'cause you can't feel it tonight
Well you can if you want to
Want to take you outside, want to show you the sky
To remind you why you shouldn't.
Do your worst if you can, do your worst if you can do it.
You can if you want. You can take it -- yeah, you want to run.
Said you wanted to then kissed the gun.
You can if you want to do it.
And you want to do it, and you want to do it
If you want to do it, you are going to do it,
even if I don't want you to.
Say it outright that you don't want to see me tonight
and you won't if you don't want to
Hide it from me if you must hide it from me
if you don't trust anything I say right to you
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to
And you want to do it, if you want to do it,
You will if you want to.
And you want to do it, and you want to do it,
if you want to do it, you are going to do it,
even if I don't want you to.
I was inside painting your name on the window
I was somewhere in sight.
And I wanted to find out why you're hiding
I was tired of the fight.
Look me in the eyes say you can't do it,
look me in the eyes say you can't do it,
but you will if you want to.
Look me in the eyes say you can't do it,
look me in the eyes say you can't do it,
but you will if you want to.
And you want to do it, and you want to do it,
If you want to do it, you are going to do it,
even if I don't want you to.

Shake it down. So much better.
Tell me that you don't know what you do.

And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to.
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to.
And you want to do it, if you want to do it
You will if you want to.

I wish I could make you right.

// One Day //

Sister don't mind that I'm not on time
She knows that I'm through with that
Sick of trying, don't let mine
Mama's still loving and daddy still loves
They know that I'm here like that
I'm like mine: true and kind

Call me aside and I will now be
And I will be fine with that
Don't leave me now, you might love me back
Distance is fine, I know you can't care
And nothing is big like that
You don't see me now, I don't see you back

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

Just to remind you I'm a mistake
How come you don't want to know?
You don't wanna see, you don't wanna show
Kicking myself, I know that you're tough
Yeah we can pretend we're that
Gotta see how, you gotta leave that

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

Snow is outside but I'm by your fire
I feel all the love you'll bring
You gotta see how we can see this out
Summer in mind and spring by your side
You'll see all the love we'll keep
Gotta see that we couldn't be there

One day I'll be fine with that
You don't leave me now
Do you love me back?

// Love More //

Chained to the wall of our room
Yeah you chained me like a dog in our
Iiiii thought that's how it was
I thought that we were fine
Then the day was night
You were high, you were high
While I was doomed
And dyin' for
With no life,
With no light.

Tied to my bed,
I was younger then, I had nothing to spend
Time on you
But it made me love,
It made me love,
It made me love more... [bis]

Do what you said, the words she said - "left out"
Over into the sky where I'll soon fly
And she took the time
To believe in, to believe in
What she said...

She made me love,
She made me love,
She made me looove more... [bis]
