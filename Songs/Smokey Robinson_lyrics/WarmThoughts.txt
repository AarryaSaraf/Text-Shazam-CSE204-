// Let Me Be The Clock //

Let me be the clock for the time of your life, oh, yeah
Let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time

I'm a cuckoo I know
Counting hours till we will be together
When the door to my heart will open
It's for sure that I will be hopin', hopin' that you

Will let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, let it begin

'Cause every moment we're apart is some good feeling wasted
A good feeling deep down inside me, told me
A good time for me to try to get you to hold me
Is right here and now

So let me be the clock for the time of your life
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, baby
And let me be the pendulum that strikes your chime
For the first time, for the first time

I wanna be your pendulum, baby
Striking your chime

Hickory dickory dock
I want to be your clock
Just set me for lifetime
And I'll wake you up every morning

Woo, woo, ooh, let me
Let me be the clock for the time of your life
For the time of your life, oh, yeah, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time and every time after that
'Cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time, for the first time

Strike your chime one time, baby
Strike your chime one time
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime
For the first time

Let me be the clock for the time of your life, oh, yeah
And let me be the pendulum who's striking your chime
For the first time and every time after that
'Cause I know where it's at

So let me, let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, baby, ooh, ooh
Let me be the pendulum striking your chime

// Heavy On Pride (Light On Love) //

Walking around talking about you
Don't miss what you had before
Heavy on pride, light on love
Claiming you came to do anything
But to see me once more, oh, baby
Heavy on pride, light on love

So you say you stopped by
To make sure I watered creeping Charlie
And to use the phone
Oh, but that ain't so
Baby, 'cause I know you well enough
To know that kind of stuff
Couldn't bring you home
I think you miss what we had
And, ooh, I need you so bad, baby

Oh, give it up, baby
Oh, give it up, baby

Walking around talking about
You're in need of nobody
Ooh, that's heavy
Heavy on pride, light on love
Claiming you aim to do nothing
To satisfy your body, ooh...
That's heavy on pride, but light on love

It's a natural thing
So if your body's aching for me
Baby, don't be shamed
'Cause there's no use to make an excuse
Just look at me and you've got to see
That I feel the same
Said I'm glad you came to get your lover's touch
And, ooh, I need you so much, baby, oh...

Never mind wasting time
Talking about who did who wrong
Heavy on pride, light on love
Heavy on pride, on pride, but light on love
Heavy on pride, light on love

Give it up, baby
Oh, come on, give it up, baby

Ooh, I need you so bad, I need you so bad, baby

Never mind wasting time
Talking about who did who wrong
Heavy on pride, light on love
Heavy on pride, on pride, but light on love
Yeah, light on it, light on it, light on love

Ooh, baby...

Play for me, y'all
Yeah

On a lonely night when you get uptight
You can't love pride
When you're living a lie
With your head up high
But you're hurting inside
That's heavy, baby
I said, that's heavy, baby

// Into Each Rain Some Life Must Fall //

Rain, rain, go away
Sunshine, I miss you
It keeps on raining
And into each rain, some life must fall

This time it's mine, maybe one day
You'll know your stormy Monday
Right now your sun seems to shine
But you just might have your rainy Georgia night

'Cause it keeps on raining
And raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall, fall

Some stormy person has the power
To start your April shower
Yes, and that old storm seems to worsen
You can't remember if it's April or December

Ooh, it keeps on raining and raining
And raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall
Fall, fall (rain)

Rain, rain, go away
Sunshine, I miss you

I keep crying and crying and crying
Yes, and even a house of stone
Will surely weaken
When the roof is leaking

Yes, it keeps on raining and raining
And raining and raining and raining
And into each rain, some life must fall
I tell you, into each rain, some life must fall, fall

Into each rain, some life must fall

// Wine, Women And Song //

We're the singers in a travelin' show
Pack our bags again and off we go
He gave his ring and love, but this I know

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I say, let's settle down, on this, he declines
For neon lights and no vacancy signs
His wonderland of fame and me he combines

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I wish that we could spend one week alone
Just him and me, but it's so plain to see

That all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

My lady, I've seen all your shows
And wrote you a thousand letters
I sure would love the chance
To make you feel a little better

All he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

And I want you to be my everything
But he is your man and I'm just a fan

He turns the ladies' heads wherever he goes
On our private life, they even impose
They think I'm lucky, 'cause it's me that he chose

But all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

I wish that I could fill his life with love
Sufficiently so he'd only need me

But all he wants me to be is his wife
Wine, women and song are his life

Wine, women and song are his life
He wants me to just be a wife, yeah
Wine, women and song are his life
Yes, wine, women and song are his life

My lady, I've seen all your shows
And wrote you a thousand letters
I sure would love the chance
To make you feel a little better, yeah

Ah, but he is your man, I'm just a fan
He is your man and I'm just a fan
I think I could make you feel better
But he is your man and I'm just a fan...

// Melody Man //

Now you don't have a particular lyric
And they don't necessarily rhyme
But it's always the same old story
And it breaks my heart every time

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Now you don't have a particular tempo
And you're not necessarily fast
But my keeping up with you is such a hard thing
Like a man with his leg in a cast

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Well, well, well
You can play me anyway you want to
You can play me anyway you can, baby
Play me anyway you want to, baby
I'm your melody man
Play me, baby, play me

Play me, baby, play me

Well, now, you're the one musician who can play me
And I've never been played this way
And you know that all you have to do is touch me
And I play whatever you say

Right in the middle of our dance
Just as soon as I catch on
Then you're gone right in the middle of our tune
You can change right up to me
But I'm your Mister Melody
Playing along with your every song

Ooh, play me anyway you want to
You can play me anyway you can, oh, baby
Play me anyway you want to
'Cause I'm your melody man
Baby, I'm your melody man

Play me, baby, play me
Play me loud in front of the crowd
Play me, baby, play me
Play me tender, make me surrender
Play me tender, make me surrender
'Cause, baby, I'm your melody man
Oh, baby, I'm your melody man

Oh, play me, baby, play me
Play me loud in front of the crowd
Play me, baby, play me
Play me tender, make me surrender
Play me tender, make me surrender
'Cause, baby, I'm your melody man
Ooh, baby, I'm your melody man

Melody man
I'm your melody man
Melody man
I'm your melody man
Play me, baby, play me...

// What's In Your Life For Me //

I could give someone like you
My everything, great and small
Bring out the best of me and take it all
Makin' love's a special thing
So take your time and get to know me
True love is what's in my life for you
Now I'm askin' you to show me

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you feel for me?

Will tomorrow bring me sorrow
'Cause I confessed my love today?
I'll take a chance on you
Come what may, come what may
Build me up and bring me down
There's no daily guarantee
I'll take the tears to know the joy
Of a chance to really see, ooh...

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, baby
What's in your life for me?

And in my love starvin' mind
It's only you I hunger for
So come fill me up, feed my soul
And if I receive the love I need
Then on your behalf, I'll be whole

Ooh, baby
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you need for me?

What's in your life
What's in your life for me?
Is there anything you can see?
Tell me, baby
Tell me what do you feel for me
For me, for me, for me...

// I Want To Be Your Love //

I want to be your love, I need to
I am the bearer of this need to need you
I used to be a sailor on the sea of life
When love's waters got too deep, I always sailed
It never failed

But now I want to stay right here and touch you
(To stay right here)
'Cause I could never get too much you
I may be the secret love of all your fantasies
But I hope I can fulfill at least a few
If you only knew

How much I want to be your love
(I want to be your love)
I want to be your love, yes, I do
(I want to be your love)

I'll be good to you
I'll be sweet and gentle and kind, yes, I will
Let me be your love
Truer love you'll never find
Never, never

Old fickle me, who's wanted to be
So many things in life
At last I think I found what's best for me
My destiny

I want to be your love
(I want to be your love)
Please, let me
(I want to be your love)
Oh, if you really want me
(I want to be your love)
You know you can get me
(I want to be your love)
So let me be your love, your love
(I want to be your love)

I'll be good to you
I'll be sweet and gentle and kind, ooh, baby
Just let me be your love
Truer love you'll never find
Let me be your love...

// Travelin' Thru //

Travelin' through life
I've been so many places
I've found treasures renown
In fantastic spaces
But the most spectacular sites
Ever to come into view
Are in the East, West, North
North and South of you

Travelin' through you
From your East and West
I find quaint invitations
To stop and take a rest
In mountains and valleys
As I go travelin' through
The East, West, North
North and South of you

In the North of you, I find
Jewels, oh, so rare
As I explore your mind
No thrills on earth were ever known
To match those found
In your torrid southern zone
You got a torrid southern zone
And I sure do like it, yes, baby
Yes, baby

Travelin' through you
Is a real living
A real reason to make
Every day a thanksgiving
To the divine creator
For having sent me through
The East, West, North
North and South of you

East, West, North
North and South of you
East, West, North
North and South of you
East, West, North
North and South of you
