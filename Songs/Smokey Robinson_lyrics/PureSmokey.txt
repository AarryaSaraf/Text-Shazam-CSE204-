// It's Her Turn To Live //

Mama raised us all her life
And now it's her turn to live, yeah
Mama gave us everything, boy
Now it's our turn to give

Little brother
Brother, don't you know?
You got the best mother
That the world has ever known
Worked her fingers to the bone
Now you're almost grown
And out on your own
She got the right to be left alone

I'm twenty, you're sixteen
And, brother, that's a-plenty
'Cause when I came on the scene
Mama was only seventeen
So she's still a young woman
If you know what I mean

She got the right
To the man of her dreams, yeah
(Talkin' 'bout mama)
She got the right
To the man of her dreams
Say it again, now
She got the right
To the man of her dreams, oh...

Mama raised us all her life
And now it's her turn to live
Her turn to live

Ooh, mama raised us all her life, oh...
And now it's her turn to live
Oh, brother, now
Mama gave us everything, boy
And now it's you're turn to give
Well, well, well

He loves our mama, loves mama
Mama loves him
And that could never harm her
But what hurts her is when a man comes in
(Yeah)
You know, give him a chance to be your friend

She got the right to be loved again
Talkin' about mama
She got the right to be loved again
She got the right to be loved again

Mama raised us all her life
Now it's her turn to live
(Her turn to live)
Ooh, brother, now
Mama gave us everything
Now it's our turn to give

Her turn to live
And our turn to give
Her turn to live
And our turn to give

Mama got the right
Mama got the right
Mama got the right
Mama got the right to live now

// The Love Between Me And My Kids //

Answer the phone, it's only me
All I wanna do is talk to my children, oh, yeah, yeah
Don't want to bother her or you, my man, no, no
But if you have a man at all, you'll understand
Ooh, the problems between her and me
They are foolish things that we did, oh

Haven't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no
Haven't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids

Even the judge, he understood now
Gave me the right to see 'em, at least on the weekend
Oh, now, buddy, you got the woman now
She chose to let me go, ah...
But if you love my kids at all, you got to know
Oh, but there's an ocean between her and me
Made of tears we often hid, ooh...

That ain't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no, now
That ain't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids

As long as I respect your home
And don't come around
Trying to cause you pain and misery, ooh...
I got the right to be with them
Oh, they got the right to be with me
I'm talkin' 'bout the kids, man
They got the right to be with me, oh...

I, I, I, I don't use my kids
For no excuse to spy on you, no
Prying into your private life
Is something I won't do, oh...
But when the woman and I broke up
Of each other we got rid, oh...

But that ain't got a thing to do with the love
No, no, no, now
That ain't got a thing to do with the love...
That ain't got a thing to do with the love
Between me and my kids

// Asleep On My Love //

You think I want you for just my friend
How mistaken can you be
To make you mine is what I intend, yeah
While wide awake, it's seems that you've been a...

Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life

Maybe it's your intent to deceive
Trying to hide what you know
'Cause I find it so hard to believe
Oh, but anyone could be so naÃ¯ve, not to be...

Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love, yeah
Asleep on my life

(Asleep on my love)
And I'd do everything to make you aware
(Asleep on my life)
That another feel for you is really there

Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life

You know I come whenever you call
Oh, and I'm always ready to give my all in all
Yet when crisis is over
Your crisis is over seems that you fall

Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life, yeah
Asleep on my love, yeah
Asleep on my life

Oh, baby
Oh, baby, oh, baby

Asleep on my love, yeah
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love, yeah
Asleep on my life
Asleep on my love
Asleep on my life

// I Am I Am //

I am, I am

Lord, who will be with you
Every day, all the way, come what may
Your story may go through
Thick and thin and back again
I'm gonna hang right in

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

Lord, who'll be standin' by
Prepared to take some heartache for your sake
Can you dig that, baby?
What kind of fool am I
When rising up, take it into your cup
When the going gets rough
Can you dig that, mama?

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah
And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

Why do you give your love
And like a flower age through every stage
Of youth and age
Can you dig that, baby?

What of the life give you
Realize your dream
Though it may seem a little too extreme
Can you dig that, mama?

I said I am, I am, I am, I am
Oh baby, I am, I am, I am, I am
You can bet your life I am, yeah

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

I am, I am I am
I am I am I am, I am
Oh baby, I am I am I am
Oh, you bet your life I am

And if the world don't like it
I don't give a damn

// Just Passing Through //

Darlin', tonight was such heavenly bliss
And I have never known a sweeter kiss
But we both know that I was just for fun
'Cause I the kind of a guy who's always on the run

My love is just passing through
My love is just passing through
My love is just passing through
Through your heart

The waters of love are much too deep
Don't wanna make any promises I can't keep
The world outside is calling to me
Your love is good, but I've got to be free

My love is just passing through
Hey, my love is just passing through
Ooh, my love is just passing through
Through your heart

Your gentle lips seem to beg me not to go
But if I hesitate, your tears may show
We both agree to forgive and forget
And there would never be any tears of regret

My love is just passing through
Oh, my love is just passing through
Babe, my love is just passing through your heart

Just passing through
Just passing through
Just passing through your heart
Ooh, yeah

My love is just passing through
Just passing through
My love is just passing through
Just passing through, ooh...
My love is just passing through
Just passing through

Just passing through
Baby, my love is just passing through
Babe, my love is just passing through
Just passing through...

// Virgin Man //

Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

When I'm with my friends
And the man talk begins
And they brag about all the love they've known
I sit in the corner all alone
The best thing I can do is listen
The most I've done is just some kissin'

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But when the conversation turns around
Virgin man they always put him down
People say he must be "funny"
He ain't had a taste of honey

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

My gift of love has never been unwrapped
My well of love it still remains untapped (oh baby)

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love (really love) a virgin man
Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)

How come people say
Lady virgin that's OK
But a man who is a man
Ain't supposed to be that way
No no no no no no

Can you love a virgin man (baby)
Can you love a virgin man
(Wonder what my friends would do if they only knew)
Can you love a virgin man
(I've been saving all my love for you, you)
Can you love a virgin man

They say making love's an art
In which each man should take part
By the time he reaches twenty one
Making love is something that he should have done
It ain't like I've never wanted to
But it's easier to think than it is to do

Can you (really) love a virgin man (baby)
Can you (really) love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man
Can you love a virgin man

// She's Only A Baby Herself //

Bad boy, made love to my daughter
What's your mind daddy gonna do
Shame on you, oh, yeah
Bad boy, bad boy, stole my baby's mind
Then you had to take her body, too
Shame on you, oh, Lord

Well, now, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself

I think back, think back, sixteen years ago
Her mama smiled, 'cause she gave to this world
A fine girl, oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Whoo, and now, now, now, now, right now
I see her mama cry
Thinking that she's failed and it's her fault
The girl got caught
Her little girl got caught

And now, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my child, my child, ooh, yeah
And she's only a baby herself

That's the song of the father
Of the girl who gave in
To the boy who made her feel like a woman
And this song may be sad
But he knows in his heart
He's gonna love that little baby that's coming

My daughter's gonna have a baby
Oh, and she's only a baby herself
Ooh, my daughter's gonna have a baby
And she's only a baby herself
Oh, my child, my child, yeah...

// Fulfill Your Need //

Put your love in the light, let it stay there
There's no use going on playing solitaire
Fulfill your need
Fulfill your need

Since love's hurt you so bad, now it's taboo
Come closer now, let me comfort you
Fulfill your need, oh, baby
Fulfill your need

A need can prove costly, yet it isn't worth a cent
If two hearts don't love with a mutual intent
Love needs love and doesn't cost a dime
It's owned by two hearts, working and giving all the time

There's a light burning low in my window
If that old love fire in you can again glow
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need

Ooh, fulfill your need
Oh, baby, fulfill your need, need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need
Fulfill your need, need, need, need, need
Oh, baby...

// A Tattoo //

Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

A tattoo, baby, that's you
The world can see your brand on me
Like a tattoo charm on a sailor's arm
Oh, like an arm tattoo
Oh, baby, that's you

A tattoo, baby, that's you
Deep within, now, under my skin
You can't be erased
No, you can't be replaced
Never can be erased
Ooh, you can't be replaced, no

A tattoo, baby, that's you
A permanent picture
Love painted on it
To say the least, ooh, a masterpiece
Yeah, to say the least
You show a masterpiece, ooh...

Tattoo, ooh, what can I do
You're a true work of art
Etched deep in my heart
You're my tattoo, Mother Nature true
Yeah, and another tattoo
Whole lot more like you, oh, baby

Tattoo, I can't have you
On a look faces show
When your heart isn't gold
Got to be on mind like a neon sign
Oh, got to be on mind like a neon sign
Yeah, got to be on mind like a neon sign

Yeah

Ooh, baby, uh
Alright...
Oh, mama

Tattoo, baby, that's you
Yeah, baby, alright
Oh, alright
Ooh...

Alright, alright, alright
