Album: Dirty

// 100% //

[Thurston]

I can never forget you - the way you rock the girls

They move a world and love you - a blast in the underworld

I stick a knife in my head - thinking 'bout your eyes

But now that you been shot dead - I've got a new surprise


I been waitin' for you just to say

He's off to check his mind

But all I know is you got no money

But that's got nothing to do with a good time


Can you forgive the boy who - shot you in the head

Or should you get a gun and - go and get revenge?

A 100% of my love - up to you true star

It's hard to believe you took off - I always thought you'd go far


But I've been around the world a million times

And all you men are slime

It's goin' to my head, goodbye I am dead

Wastewood rockers is time for cryin', hey!

// Swimsuit Issue //

[Kim]

I'm just here for dictation - I don't wanna be a sensation

Bein' on Sixty Minutes - was it worth your fifteen minutes?


Don't touch my breast - I'm just working at my desk

Don't put me to the test - I'm just doing my best


Shopping at MaxFields - power for you to wield

Dreams of going to the Grammies - `till you poked me with your whammy


You spined the disc - now you're moving your wrist

I'm just from Encino - why are you so meano


I'm just here for dictation - and not your summer vacation

You really like to shmooze - well now you're on the news


I'm from Sherman Oaks - just a wheel with spokes

But I ain't giving you headace - in a Sunset bungalow


Roshumba, Judith, Paulina, Cathy, Vendella, Naomi,

Ashley, Angie, Stacey, Gail

Ice women

Ice women

Ice women

// Theresa's Sound-World //

[Thurston]

Like girl come walkin' thru the cornfield

Like blue vibration thru the sea

I know I'd love her to breathe, again

Like cubes are talkin' her down


I've been a wasted day

Like spinning round a saint

Like colored wild sign

Theresa talkin' in the rain


Like girl be growin' thru town

Windows are thoughts in the stain

I know I'd love her to stay

Whispering signs are agreeing


Like talkin' golden terrain

Like thrivin' dark in the saint

A cat in gold goes along

Theresa's sound for the king

// Drunken Butterfly //

[Kim]

Smile like a sun, back over time

Crazy fr you, pleasure is mine

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?


You're coming thru, even it up

Going too far, try understand

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?


Whisper kiss yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear

Whisper the kisses in yr ear, I'll tell you what I fear


Come on home, just ain't fair

Name of rock'n'roll, where love dies

Couldn't find a soul, tell it like it is

Deep down inside, drunken butterfly

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

I love you, I love you, I love you, what's your name?

// Shoot //

[Kim]

Can I have some money? I'm gonna go to the store

Can I have some money? I can't tell you what it's for

Can I have some money? you know it's you that I adore

Can I have some money? don't ask me what it's for


Since we've been together you've been good to me

You only hit me when you wanna be pleased


Can I have the car keys? I'm gonna go for a ride

Can I have the car please? I'm going out for a while

Can I have the car now? I wanna drive all around

Can I have the car dear? I'm gonna to leave this town


I won't be asking your permission to leave

I won't be asking not to have this baby please

And I won't be asking a devil for a bus fare please

And I won't be asking I had to see you bleed


Ssssssh

Visualize

That's right

Pray baby

One two three

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot


Can I have my lipstick? that was such a surprise

Can I have my lipstick? I'm going out for a ride

I'm not a little girl, and you sure are not my dad

You don't even know what you almost had

// Wish Fulfillment //

[Lee]

I see your wishes on the wall, and that's all right with me

I see you run to make a call, hoping that there's someone free

Your life and my life they don't touch at all, and that's no way to be

We've never seemed so far


What's real? what is true?

I ain't turning my back on you

Where're you goin'? where've you been?

Making wishes, watching dreams


It might be simple, it might be true, I might be overwhelmed by you

You might be empty, the way your eyes just look right through

It's such a mess now anyway, wish fulfillment every day

I don't believe you, now I can't hear a word you say


I see you shaking in the light, reading the headline news

The others they're not quite so bright, we want them to choose you

I could almost see your face tonight, singing simple rhythm'n'blues

You'll always be a star


Shake it baby! come'on scream!

Just see your face in a magazine

Don't doubt it! leaves Chris sore! (?)

I can't stand it anymore


It's my favorite shot of you, you look so pretty your eyes were true

I'm still on your side, in spite of everything you do

We're only blood on blood on life, you paint me pictures every night (?)

Come wish beside me, don't you know you know what's right

// Sugar Kane //

[Thurston]

You're perfect in the way, a perfect end today

You're burning out their lights, and burning in their eyes

I love you Sugar Kane, a-comin' from the rain

Oh kiss me like a frog, and turn me into flame

I love you all the time, I need you 8 to 9

And I can stay all night, yr body shining


And I know

There's something down there sugar soul

Back to the cross a twisted lane

There something down there sugar kane


I'm back again in love, I'm back again a dove

Where'd you get your light, your smilin' sugar life

Another lovers day, another cracked up night

Every night I say, the light is coming


And I know

There's something down there sugar cone

Back to the cross a twisted lane

There's something down there sugar kane


Hey angel come and play, and fly me away

A stroll along the beach, until you're out of time

I love you sugar kane, a crack into the dream

I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane

I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar kane

I love you sugar kane, I love you sugar

// Orange Rolls, Angel's Spit //

[Kim]

She got you, got you good - didn't have a chance

Pretty lady put you in - wear hat master ends (?)

Oh baby don't you know - you're livin' on the death

You better stay away - if you wanna live


Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah


Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below

Oooh - sugar pie

Mmm - come on

Chocolate spot


She gotta gun and all - don't you even know

She looks into your eyes - angels wanna go (?)

She takes it on the stride - leap through mind again (?)

Don't worry you are fine - living with the mess


Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah


Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below

Ooh - sugar pudding

Candy tic

Orange rolls - angel's spit


Boy she's got you got you good - don't you even try?

Come on if you could - you would surely die

You take it towards your mouth - you don't even know

Come on sugar tic - you are gonna go


Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah

Lalalalalalalalalaaaaaah


Every time you turn around she is lookin' up at you and down below

Cool dye - chocolate spot

Check her out - don't you know 

Deep in my heart - saying g'bye (?)

// Youth Against Fascism (Hate Song) //

[Thurston]

Another can of worms

Another stomach turns

Yeh yr ghetto burns

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


You got a stupid man

You got a Ku Klux Klan

Yr fuckin' battle plan

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


A sieg heil-in' squirt

You're an impotent jerk

Yeh a fascist twerp

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


Black robe and swill

I believe Anita Hill

Judge will rot in hell

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


Yeah a cross on fire

By a christian liar

A black attack on fire

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


Yeah the president sucks

He's a war pig fuck

His shit is out of luck

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


Another nazi attack

A skinhead is cracked

My blood is black

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


We're banging pots and pans

To make you understand

We gonna bury you man

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate


I'm a human wreck

A redneck in check

I killed the teacher's pet

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

It's the song I hate, it's the song I hate

// Nic Fit //

[Nic Fit]

Get it up, get it in

Sonic tooth, sonic truth

Nic fit, nic fit, nic fit, nic fit


Sign'em up, gotta smoke (?)

Arafat, get a smoke (?)

Nic fit, nic fit, nic fit, nic


Nic fit, nic fit, nic fit, nic fit


Sonic truth, sonic death

Sonic smoke, sonic youth

Nic fit, nic fit, nic fit, nic

// On The Strip //

[Kim]

Every time you look my way

You shine a light in what you say

Every time you look my way

You talk a rhyme called purple haze


Close your eyes and pretend

You're not at all a black friend


A smileless girl on the strip

You really learn just how to be hip

Tell yr stories 'bout your crazy trip

Messing with stars and doing tricks


Close your eyes and pretend

It started all back then


Big glass house on the hill

Doing dope but did you swear

Yesterday was buried last year

While I don't care I thought was clear


Close your eyes and pretend

This is how it should end


Cinderella of the night

Doesn't know her left from right

She so hungry for a bite

Forget your friends for a big night


Don't you know who's keeping score

Who's that barking at your door


Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear

That was then, this is now


Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear, a little bit

Hold tight with fear

That was then, this is now


Every time you look my way

Remember a girl who used to say

Hold me tight any way

It's okay it's only play


I will remember in my dawn

What I came for, for a lark

// Chapel Hill //

[Thurston]

A-back in the days when the battles raged, and we thought it was nothing

A bookstore man meets the CIA, and we know

Throw me a cord and plug it in, get the cradle rocking

Ah, out with the redneck pig old men, and it's go


The hair in the hole in my head

Too bad the scene is dead

Memories in the shadow

Back in time again


Ah, I can't forget your terrorized face, when you cried for the shameless

Wasted life Ameri-K-K-Kan, and you smile

So why should we run when we cannot hide, and my flag is burning?

We could be wrong but that's allright, we'll rise again


The hair in the hole in my head

Too bad the scene is dead

Memories in the shadow

It's back in town again


Lookin' away it's another day, and of course we love you

Radical man is the CIA, and we say no

We'll round up the Durham H.C. kids, and the Char Grill Killers

Jesse H. come into our pit, all ages show


The hair in the hole in my head

Too bad the scene is dead

Memories in the shadow

It's back in time again

// JC //

[Kim]

Always cost a pair of hose - spaces pressed together rose

Arms around each others back - you know that I liked you Jack

And all the other boys who pose - a silent dance in the woods

In the suburb light is shown - another can of Coca Cola

Don't you ever call me Mom - freckled dancing in the plan 

And air so thin it weighs a ton - you can see as far as fun

You're nothing but a history - a second here and then you're gone

Quicksand, quicksand all around - turn the corner just beyond

The shadows move and change the groove - and something tells me not to brood

Turning room and that's a show - you're walking through my heart once more

Don't forget to close the door - I'm not certain of what you found

All the men want a charming whore - like a crown fortunes

Sunny skies and angels bleed - falling down upon my knees

That wasn't how it's supposed to be - clear blue eyes, justice tries

The wind is busy blowing dizzy - you're dreams were shot like a star

Exploding in a mind somewhere - doing something on a dare

Pulling a trigger like breathing air - a sunkissed boy that gave no thought

To what he'd made while others sake


Ocean spreads a candle sand - it's dripping in my hand, you're dead

Little brother reminding me - the moments tick forever true

You can see as far as him - don't you know the shape I'm in

You're walking through my heart once more - don't forget to close the door

// Purr //

[Thurston]

Whoahooh!


I love you baby 'cause you're back in time - I love you today

Yr eyes are flashing like a magic sign - the sun comes out to play


I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you

How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog

I do it every day - come back again tomorrow

You chased it all away


A dreaming beauty sleeping day and night - the sun around you

I love you baby yeah you're superfine - a-comin' down too

A purring whirring fuzzy lights of day - a-switching sunlight

I chase you kitten catch you every time - funny how it flies


I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you

How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog

I do it every day - come back again tomorrow

You chase the life away


I hear you purring through a supersoul - a-puff in to it

A puss in leather yeah a prince in gold - a leather tale away


I learned it all from you girl - I got it all from you

How to howl the moon yeah - and how to scratch yr dog

I do it every day - come back again tomorrow

You chase the life away

// Creme Brulee //

[Kim]

Aaaaaaaaaaoooow

Whoooow

Ha

Ha


Riding down the road it nearly struck me blind

You and me are burning in the summertime


Let's go find some shady ground

Gotta get rid of that king hell throng

You and me are burning in the summertime

You and me are burning in the summertime


Scrape, scrape, scrapin' melted cheese

Say I love you, later please

You and me are burning in the summertime

You and me are burning in the summertime


Dark spots floating in front of my eyes

Mum said she turned it and squattin' flies

You and me are burning in the summertime

You and me are burning in the summertime


Last night I dreamed I kissed Neil Young

If I was a boy I guess it would be fun

You and me are burning in the summertime

You and me are burning in the summertime


Don't you know a city where the horses grow?

Green malls hanging chillin' crows

You and me are burning in the summertime

You and me are burning in the summertime


I said it before and I'll say it again:

"I'm so happy we're just friends"
