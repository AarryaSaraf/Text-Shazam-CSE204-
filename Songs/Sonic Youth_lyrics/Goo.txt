Album: Goo

// Dirty Boots //

[Thurston]
Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

Time to take a ride - time to take it in a midnite eye
And if you wanna go - get on below
Pinking out the day - dreaming out the crazy way
Finger on the love - it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You'll be making out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road - and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on - hi di ho
Pinking out the black - dreaming in a crack
Satan got her tongue - now it's undone

I got some dirty boots - yeah dirty boots
I got some dirty boots - baby
Dirty boots

Hey!

// Tunic (Song For Karen) //

[Kim]
Dreaming, dreaming of a girl like me
Hey what are you waiting for - feeding, feeding me
I feel like I'm disappearing - getting smaller every day
But I look in the mirror - I'm bigger in every way

She said:
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

I'm in heaven now - I can see you Richard
Goodbye Hollywood, goodbye downey - hello Janis
Hello Dennis, Elvis - and all my brand new friends
I'm so glad you're all here with me, until the very end

Dreaming, dreaming of how it's supposed to be
But now this tunic's spinning - around my arms and knees
I feel like I'm disappearing - getting smaller every day
But when I open my mouth to sing - I'm bigger in every way

She said:
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Hey mom! look I'm up here - I finally made it
I'm playing the drums again too
Don't be sad - the band doesn't sound half bad
And I remember mom, what you said
You said honey - you look so under-fed

[background voices singing various covers]

[Kim]
Another green salad, another ice tea
There's a tunic in the closet waiting just for me
I feel like I'm disappearing - getting smaller every day
But I look in your eyes - and I'm bigger in every way

She said:
You aren't never going anywhere
You aren't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere
I ain't never going anywhere

Goodbye Richard - gotta go now
I'm finally on my own - but Dan's got a gig
Keep the love lights glowing - little girl's got the blues
I can still hear momma say: "honey don't let it go to your head"

// Mary Christ //

[Thurston / Kim]
Talking to a punker priest
Just dogging the breeze
About beein in a tree / he says it's free now!
Along comes Mary Christ
Skating light on ice
And says, 'let's go on high' / later, priestoid!
You gotta go - God I got a date now
Yeh I know - shall not be late now

Possessed by x-ray eyes
Her spirit spy's
Into my lies / let's burn 'em out now!
Wraps my head in skin
Says now I'm in
Dig the candy skin / yeh spit it out now!
Everytime - she sings that low song
Everytime - I know I'm right, wrong

Angel in a devil skirt
Buys me a shirt
Says I hope you like / uh, like what now!?
Hope I hope you like
Like you like yr hope
With the tightest rope / I see, I know now!
Here we go - I've been waitin so long
Yeh I know - for Mary to come along
Aaaooooiii

// Kool Thing //

[Kim]
Kool Thing sittin' with a kiddie
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a chance here
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Kool Thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so
[Chuck D]
Yeah, tell'em about it, 
Hit'em where it hurts
Hey, Kool Thing, come here, sit down 
There's something I go to ask you. 
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls 
From male white corporate oppression?
Tell it like it is!
Huh?
Yeah!
Don't be shy
Word up!
Fear of a female planet?
Fear of a female planet?
Fear, baby!
I just want to know that we can still be friends
Come on, come on, come on, come on let everybody know
Kool thing, kool thing

When you're a star, I know you'll fix everything
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are the master
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Kool thing walkin' like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing walkin' like a panther
What'd he say?
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

// Mote //

[Lee]
When you see the spiral turning through alone
And you feel so heavy that you just can't stop it
When this sea of madness turns you into stone
Picture of your life shoots like a rocket
All the time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you (?)
From nowhere - to nowhere
Cut together - cutting through

I'm island-bound, a mote inside my eye
I can't see you breathing as before
I am airless - a vacuum child
I can't stand to reason at your door
In this time

Put 'me' in the equation it's alright
I've seen you moving in and out of sight
My friends tell me it's all cut through you (?)
From nowhere - to nowhere
Come together

I'm down in the daytime out of sight
Comin' in from dreamland I'm on fire
I can see it's all been here before
Dream a dream that lies right at your door

When the seasons circle sideways out of turn
And words don't speak just fall across the carpet
You're just in time to watch the fires burn
It seems a crime but yr. face is bright you love it
All the time...

// My Friend Goo //

My friend Goo has a real tattoo
She always knows just what to do
She looks through her hair like she doesn't care (?)
What she does best is stand and stare

She can play the drums set too
And the boys say: "hey Goo what's new?"' hey Goo what's new?
My friend Goo just says: "Hey you"
My friend Goo just says: "Hey you"

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
She likes to wear green underwear
And lays down almost anywhere

She doesn't have nothing to do
And the boys say: "hey Goo what's new?"' hey Goo what's new?
My friend Goo just says: "Hey you"
My friend Goo just says: "Hey you"

I know a secret or two about Goo
She won't mind if I tell you
I know a secret or two about Goo
I know a secret about Goo and you

And she sticks just like glue
And the boys say: "hey Goo what's new?"' hey Goo what's new?
My friend Goo just goes: "Hey you"
My friend Goo just goes: "Hey you"

Goo Goo Goo

Goo Goo Goo

Goo Goo Goo
My friend Goo
Goo Goo Goo
Talkin' 'bout Goo
Goo Goo Goo
My friend Goo
Goo Goo Goo
You would too
Goo

// Disappearer //

[Thurston]
Here it comes again - out of the rain
Seems to have a new - kind of same
Been it playing on a - simple rhyme
The site comes alive and - speaks the mind
It turns to me and - it turns to gold
It turns to see a - the fast lane slow

It's been a way too long
It's been the way I gone
It's a-coasting on
To the west star

Looking out I thought I - saw it blink
Coming on to me - like a silver eye
Pick it up and - turn it on and
Head on out to a - western starland

It's been a man and gone (?)
Now it's a singing song
Like a western star
It's going my way

Looking out I'm back in - time to stay
Into the eastern - silent way (?)
Comes alive through - through and clearer (?)
Ghost arise to - dirty mirror (?)

You've been away too long 
It's been way too long
An eastern star is on
A disappearer

// Cinderella's Big Score //

[Kim]
If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar 
Than a hug from your sis

You really fucked up this time
Your old lady's really pissed
She's not just laughing
She's polishing her fist

If you could give me anything
Would you consider a fist?
Don't give me yr soul
It's caught is an abyss

Here's a pack of ciggies
Fresh from the wonder lips
A dream, a wish, a heart's desires
Cinderella is a kiss

A cold is gonna take you
And freeze away your tears
Ome a little closer honey
You can be so near

Mind your heart aside you (?)
Really got no sense of time (?)
Ninety-nine inside you (?)
That I'm scared if you were cryin'

If I could give you anything
I would give you a kick
You'd rather have a dollar
Than a hug from your sis

A cold is gonna take you
And freeze away your tears
Come a little closer honey
We can be so near

// Titanium Expose //

[Thurston]
Waking up I see you dreaming of a drive in
Open yr eyes to see TV-set on blue
I've been waiting for you to smile, I'm the great head freezin' (?)
Wintertime comes summer, you are why it's happenin', to me

[Kim]
Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
Sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?

[Thurston]
I feel the morning slip in sights into your mirror
Now I see what might see it's pretty clear
I been looking just to feel that funny feelin'
I don't know but it's a mystery to reckon, right you

[Kim]
Sugar babe, sugar babe do it to me
Do me babe, do me babe can't you see me?
I'm sugar now, sugar now do it to me
Take me babe, take me babe can't you see me?
