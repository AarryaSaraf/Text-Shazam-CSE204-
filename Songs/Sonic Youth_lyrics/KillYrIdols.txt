// Protect Me You //

[Kim]
Protect me from ravagement
I'm ten years old
I don't know what to do
Protect me myself
I'm fourteen
There's nothing to do
Protect me yourself
I'm sixteen
Protect me from starving
I'm eighteen
Protect me you
I don't know what to do
Protect me demons
That come at night
I don't know what they say
Their whispering
Sends the night air away
And makes me forget
I hope they come
Again and again

Here they come
Again and again
I hope they come again
Again
Again

She's finally discovered she's a...
He told her so
She's finally discovered she's a...
He told her so
She's finally discovered she's a...
He told her so

Come closer and I'll tell you
Come closer and I'll tell you
Come closer and I'll take off your dress

I'll take off your dress
I'll shake off your flesh
I'll shake off your flesh
I'll shake off your flesh

Shake off your flesh
Shake off your flesh

Turn around
Turn around
Turn around

Shake
[repeat nine times]

Shake off your flesh
Shake off your flesh
Shake off your flesh
Shake off your flesh

Shake shake
[repeat eighteen times]

Shake

// Kill Yr Idols //

I don't know why
You wanna impress Christgau
Ah let that shit die
And find out the new goal

Kill yr idols
Sonic death
It's the end of the world
Your confusion is sex

Kill yr idols
Sonic death
It's the end of the world
Your confusion is sex

// Brother James //

"Take my hand" he said to me
Follow now or you'll be damned
Let's go to the other side
Let's go to the other side
Great balls of simplicity
Great balls of simplicity
Brother James gave em to me
Brother James gave em to me
I don't need em anymore
Don't go knockin' at my door
I don't need em anymore
Don't go knockin' at my door

Take my hand, you might as well
We're going straight to hell
I don't wanna hang around
Won't you stick yr head in the ground

// Early American //

Nothing but a savage blur
In your face, in your land
The weight of you is greater than
Forgot my pride
Forgot my side
Don't bother to leave
There's no room outside
Your sense of pride
Nothing here but a savage blur
