Album: Sister

// Schizophrenia //

[Thurston]

I went away to see an old friend of mine

His sister came over she was out of her mind

She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin

She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in

Her light eyes were dancing she is insane

Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain

She keeps coming closer saying "I can feel it in my bones

Schizophrenia is taking me home"


My Future is static

It's already had it

I could tuck you in

And we can talk about it

I had a dream

And it split the scene

But I got a hunch

It's coming back to me

// (I Got A) Catholic Block //

[Thurston]

I got a catholic block

Inside my head

I let it go to work

Bring it all back home


It serves you right

And I can motor down

You got to earn yr freedom

Get it on my own


I just live 4ever

There just is no end

I just trust the oppression

Like I trust yr friends


I got a catholic block

Inside my head

I let it play around

Iron to gold


Come back to me awhile


I got a catholic block it's around my head

I got a catholic block and it's blood orange red

I got a catholic block do you like to fuck?

I got a catholic block guess I'm out of luck

// Beauty Lies In The Eye //

[Kim]

There's something in the air there

Makes you go insane

Brings you back to me

It's been so long

All that I have to do

Is live along

It's coming coming down

Over me

Do you want to see

The explosions in my eye

Do you want to see

The reflection of

How we used to be

Beauty lies

In the eyes of anothers dreams

Beauty lies

Lost in anothers dream

It's coming coming down

Over me

Do you want to see

The explosions in my eye

Do you want to see

The reflection of

How it used to be


Hey baby

Hey sweetheart

Hey fox come here

Hey beautiful

Come here sugar

// Stereo Sanctity //

[Thurston]

Seven

Seven


I'm keeping my commission to faith's transmission

Two speakers dream the same and skies turn red

Satellites flashing down orchard and delancey

I can't get laid cuz everyone is dead

Hey - gold connections

Analog soul waving in yr hair

Hey - hylozoic directions

She's talking blue streaks everywhere

Your spirit is time-reversed to your body

Stereographic mix-up field on field

It started growing up the day your body dies

Only apparently, real to irreal

Hey - stereo stations

Perfect image, kneel down

Hey - hypostatic information

Come on let's hear you turn it around

// Pipeline / Kill Time //

[Lee]

Stretch me to the point where I stop

Run ten thousand miles and then think of me

I think you know the place we should meet

Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late


Run me out a thin wire

Help me to kill this, love

I'll meet you tonite at the bottom of the well

Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea


I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't

Flame on in my head

My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up

He was mistaken for sane


We move and groove and cut loose from fear

We should kill time, we'll shut it down

I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you

Opening in my head


Bright glass on a chair being wound around us

The toiling of idle hands

Dripping,

With guilt

A secret form of punishment

Axes thru skulls

Shadow of futility

Endless / revolt

The shining of light and shadows


Dividing each existance

No-one is right

Nothing is solid

Nothing can be held in my hands for long


Discontinuity

Sandy beaches

Bridges sinking into the sea

Beautiful confusion

You're a fading memory


We should kill time

// Tuff Gnarl //

[Thurston]

He's running on a tuff gnarl in his head

He's got a fatal erection home in bed

He's really smart and he's really fast

He's got a hard tit killer fuck in his past

Saints preserve us in hot young stuff

The saving grace is a sonic pig pile

Amazing grazing strange and raging

Flies are flaring through your brains

Spastic flailing literally raising my roof

An adrenal mental man-tool box explodes in music creates utopia

You gnarl out on my nerves you weird and crush the cranking raunch

Flesh dirt forcefield lost and found let's burn your broken heart

Set our sight on sights not yet set let's scorch your wavo wig

Let's poke your eyes out

// Pacific Coast Highway //

[Kim]

Come on get in the car

Lets go for a ride somewhere

I won't hurt you

As much as you hurt me

Let me take you there

Before the sun goes down

Come on give me your love

Comon baby all you have

I wanna take your breathe away

Comon baby

Just like that, you say

You make me feel so crazy

Comon get in the car

Lets go for a ride somewhere

I won't hurt you

You make me feel so crazy


Come on get in the car

Lets go for a ride somewhere

I won't hurt you

As much as you hurt me

Let me take you there

Before the sun goes down

Come on give me your love

Comon baby all you have

I wanna take your breathe away

Comon baby

Just like that, you say

You make me feel so crazy

Comon get in the car

Lets go for a ride somewhere

You make me feel so good

You make me feel so crazy

// Hot Wire In My Heart //

[Thurston]

Insulation

In my circulation

I'm a mating rhythm

Sick with electricion

Nazi operation

Devestation


Wire up a radio

And I am a mating rhythm

Wire up the radio

Turn the terror and find my limit


Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart


Like this


(I feel now?)

They're movin' in

Pull the zipper

It's sliding up

I don't have a reason

Honey for your best man


Wire up a radio

And I am a beating rhythm

Wire up for the radio

Turn the terror an'


Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart


Like this


A kicking in the nightshifts

Greasing up/a teasing of my fingertips

I think you'll find us

Anybody's title??

Got my eyes on the controls

Turned on let's go


Wire up the radio

And I am a mating rhythm

Wire up for the radio

Turn the treble and fight my limit


Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart

Hot wire my heart


Like this

// Kotton Crown //

[Thurston & Kim]

Love has come to stay in all the way

Its gonna stay forever and every day

It feels like a wish coming true

It feels like an angel dreaming of you

Feels like heaven forgiving and getting

Feels like we're fading and celebrating

You got a carnal spirit spraying

I'm gonna laugh it up

You got a cotton crown I'm gonna keep it underground

You're gonna take control of the chemistry

And you're gonna manifest the mystery

You got a magic wheel in your memory

I'm wasted in time and I'm looking everywhere

I don't care where

I don't care where

Angels are dreaming of you

Angels are dreaming of you

Angels are dreaming of you

Angels are dreaming of you


New York City is forever kitty

I'm wasted in time and you're never ready

Fading fading celebrating

I got your cotton crown

I got your cotton crown

I got your cotton crown

I got your cotton crown

I got your cotton crown

I got it

// White Cross //

[Thurston]

Burning inside

(I cross myself

It doesn't help)

Because I'm not smart enough

(I'm digging into

Hot white)

Learning not to lie

(we cross it out

And stay away)


Burning inside

We cross it out and stay away

// Master-Dik //

[Thurston]

One two, one two, one two titty

I know every nook and cranny in New York City

We're ciccone and that's enough

I'm the royal tuff titty and you gotta taste my love

Taste my love

Yeah

Meeeh

Come on everybody and rock with me

I am the one on the christmas tree

Now working at the word like a moving storm

Now walking up the stairs and cookin' up the (board?)

Trippin' everywhere I don't fucking care

Put on some dark eyes and waving goodbye
