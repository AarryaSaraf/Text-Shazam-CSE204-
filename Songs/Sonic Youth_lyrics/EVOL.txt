// Tom Violence //

[Thurston]
My violence is a dream
A 'real dream'
A skinny arm
A crush on living sin
My violence
Is a sleeping head
Nodding out to rising bliss
I left home for experience
Carved 'suk for honesty' on my chest
My violence is the number
Coming out of prayer
Find it in the father
Find it in a girl

There's a thing in my memory
Hoilding on for dear life
With a feeling of secrets
Beating up under my flesh
My tongue is tied
I'm sleeping nights awake
Tom violence is a dream
Coming out of a girl

// Shadow Of A Doubt //

[Kim]
Met a stranger on a train
He bumped right into me
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
Must a been a dream
From a thousand years ago
I swear I didn't mean it
I swear it wasn't meant to be
From the bottom of my heart
He was looking all over me
Together everafter
He said
"You take me & I'll be you"
"You kill him & I'll kill her"
Kiss me
I swear it wasn't meant to be
I swear I didn't mean it
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
It's just a dream
It's just a dream I had
Nononoooooh
Swear it's just a dream
Just a dream
Dream I've had
No
No
No
No
Take me to it
Take me to her
Maybe
Maybe it's just a dream
It's a dream
It's just a
Just a
No

Met a stranger on a train
Bumped right into me
Swear I didn't mean it
Swear it wasn't meant to be
Must've been a dream
From a thousand years ago
Kiss me
Kiss me in the shadow of a doubt
Kiss me

// Starpower //

[Kim]
Spinning dreams with angel wings
Torn blue jeans + a foolish grin
Burning down in the night
So cool + so right
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my eyes and think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me

Burning down in the night
Supercool it's alright
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my mind when I think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me

// In The Kingdom #19 //

[Lee]
They were

Aaaah
He did what he had to do
He asked no questions
He had few conversations
The tar glistens in the noon heat
He tread across the grass, up onto, and down off of, the concrete abutments

Mirage on the highway
Ghosts in the tunnel
The dark cave

Out into the blinding light of day at breakneck speed
Every bolt rumbling

Glistening highway mirage groans
The slick surface
Careening into first the small mammal, and then screeching along the guard
Rail, scraping paint and throwing sparks like sheets of pure terror for
400 yards
Over and over

With one final back and forth rocking motion coming to rest
Wheeehah

The beautiful paintjob hopelessly marred

Smoke and flames

Allright
So nice
He moved to the small creature
Screeching whistles of steam blowing off
On it's back, wheels spinning like a cinema classic
The door sags open and a man covered in blood drops the three feet or so to
The pavement
The car still rattling and shaking as if with a mind of it's own, unwilling
To die
The man, 40ish, also after a time, an agonisingly painful period of time

Is also unwilling to die

Suddenly all is quite quiet there in the sunlight on the highway
But what? what can I do?
I cannot move, everything is about broken
Blood everywhere, mixing with oil and gas
What's moving, must turn my head
Pain, white light, blinded
Some guy there kneeling in the blinded mirage of white light
All my strength to 'heeeeeelp'
Screaming now help me please
He tried to tamp out the bit of burning ember which had lept from the wreck
Onto his grimy coatsleeve
Coughing blood
What's happen?
He's he's inching towards truth
He strode of into the woods with the animal
It still lived
He didn't glance back at all

Still out ghosting the road
Death on the highway
Words crumble around me and fall with the weight of heaven
I cannot move
I'm beneath the great weight
I cannot see
My eyes are blinded
I am in the darkness

That's it

{very low in the mix}
In panic I forget it
In despair I need it
In my mind I save it
In death I have it
{then a bit louder}
In panic I forget it
In despair I need it

I shouldn't laugh
Hah hah hah
Yeah really
Oh

In panic I forget it
In despair I need it
In my mind I save it
In death I have it
[Thurston?]
Never gave a damn about the meterman
I was the man who had to read the meters, man

// Green Light //

[Thurston]
I kneel before the green light
Of her singing crayon eyes
And then I kiss her stomach
And it's then I realize:
Her light is the night
I'm not blind, I believe in you
I see a green light
I see a green light
I see a green light

// Secret Girl //

[Kim]
My mother used to say
'you're the boy that can enjoy invisibility'
I'm the boy that can enjoy invisibility
Close your eyes make a wish
Cross yourself
See yourself
Feel yourself
Scream once more
Move yourself
Across the floor
Burn inside
Between two walls
The advertisements say
The pleasure's ever lasting
Come an' touch me
The advertisements say
The pleasure's ever lasting
Must be dead and gone to heaven
Come and touch me here
So I know
That I'm
Not there

// Marilyn Moore //

[Thurston]
Sound asleep till right until day
Frustrated desire turns you away
And turns you insane
Over and over

You get to a point
To make it disappear
And you're always believing
And believing in fear
Over and over
And over and over
And over and over

Marilyn Moore

It's always a headache the size of a tour truck
She's full of disorders, depends what you're used to
She's talking of tranches of truncheons in battle

Of bruises from bottles that never get better
Bad baby bitching she screams at the door
Hammer in hand & her head to the floor
Marilyn Moore

// Expressway To Yr. Skull //

[Thurston]
We're gonna kill
The California girls
We're gonna fire the exploding load in the milkmaid maiden head
We're gonna find the meaning
Of feeling good
And we're gonna stay there as long as we think we should

Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway
To your skull

Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway
To your skull

Mystery train
Three way plane
Expressway

To your skull
