// Down Wit That //

[Jeremih:]
It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown

[Chance The Rapper:]
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

[Jeremih:]
I been saving all year to spend some M's
If you had a twinny twin, I spend again
She love it when I light the tree
It's that time of year
On her Insta taking pics now Michigan
Big wheelin' ferris wheel like Navy Pier
Don't you vibe with a nigga
Get that show you right
Take you round Chicago get that show you right
Hit up Chano get you finished with the 309
I must say that this time around
Feels better with you, yes it's true

It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown

[Chance The Rapper:]
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

Ooh Tiny Tim thought you would get a nice Nintendo
Ain't yo momma told you that this year that all the ends low
Ain't yo momma told you bout inviting all your friends though
Ain't yo broke ass uncle busting juggs up out the Venmo
Ain't you tired of staying outside and freezing while the wind blow
Ain't it been some time since you seen Santa with no send off
Chatham ain't get no gifts, shit, Chatham ain't get no wish
So Chano gon' take that list, pssh, we ain't no bitch!
I am thumbing through a check for some kids from the south side
We don't get respect on the black or the brown side
Rats in the school, ain't no class in the pool
We gon' act us a fool 'til we have something too!

[Jeremih:]
It's better when you hug me

Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)
Is you down with that? (doo doo do do doo)

// Lil Bit (Interlude) //

Hey, what's up? It's Hannibal Buress and it's another Christmas album from Chance the Rapper and Jeremih. I guess these motherfuckers just really love Christmas! Two Christmas albums?
Jesus Christ! No pun intended

[Chance the Rapper:]
Am I high? A lil' bit (yeah)
Can I drive? A lil' bit (yeah)
Am I fine? A lil' bit (skrrr)
Can I vibe? A lil' bit (yeah)
Dancing diamond? A lil' bit
Sunshine a lil' flip
Pretty woman? A lil' bit
Frankie Lymon? A lil' bit
My baby momma a lil' rich
That's the one I'm still with
Break up and get fixed
We'll get hitched like Will Smith
Lame nigga beg your pardon
All my niggas taking charges (OK)
All you niggas making bargains
Stealing lighters, taking chargers
Every painter ain't an artist
Every album ain't a target
I just had to supermarket it
I just had to shoot the target
Put the flower in the pot
Put the pot in the bowl
Put the stove on the flame
Let it rock, let it roll
Get the water from the sink
Watch it grow, watch it grow
Watch it grow, watch it grow
Watch it grow, watch it grow

[Jeremih:]
I'm cold a lil' bit
Wrists froze a lil' bit
Black ice lil' bit
Whip sliding a lil' bit
Oh you say you're tired? A lil' bit
Can we just vibe lil' bit
It's grey skies a lil' bit
Just spend the night lil' bit
I'm cold a lil' bit
Wrists froze a lil' bit
Black ice lil' bit
Whip slide a lil' bit
Oh, you say you're tired? A lil' bit
Can we just vibe lil' bit
Know it's grey skies a lil' bit
Stay for the night lil' bit

Real life I admit I missed the snow in the wintertime
Grinch don't steal no Christmas, give me mine
Tryna show you Black Friday, tell 'em niggas get in line
And you know what I need, don't stop no for them gifts
Say I'm on your list
I follow they won't shop, oh you think I'm on a bitch
I know you say you wanna dip shorty
Pick you from the Ritz
We should just get to first base
I'ma take the pitch

[Chance the Rapper:]
(Mhm)
Hit Sephora right quick (Mhm)
Tower water right quick (Mhm)
Light menorah right quick (Mhm)
Mike fedora right quick (Mhm)
South shore to the seashore out in Bora Bora right quick
Ford Taurus right quick
Lil' chorus right quick

[Jeremih:]
I'm cold a lil' bit
Wrists froze a lil' bit
Black ice lil' bit
Whip slide a lil' bit
Oh you say you're tired? A lil' bit
Can we just vibe lil' bit
It's grey skies a lil' bit
Just spend the night lil' bit
I'm cold a lil' bit
Wrists froze a lil' bit
Black ice lil' bit
Whip slide a lil' bit
Oh, you say you're tired? A lil' bit
Can we just vibe lil' bit
Know it's grey skies a lil' bit
Stay for the night lil' bit

Lil' boys and girls wanna come and play?
Toy with the lights, Rudolph on the sleigh
Snow from the sky, midnight on the way
Santa down the chimney for the cookies on the plate
Joy and some cheers in the ghetto today
'Tis the season, give love away
Have yourself a very merry Christmas
Have yourself a very merry Christmas
