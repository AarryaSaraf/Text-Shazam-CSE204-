// B.I.T.C.H. //

(I'd rather keep it real with ya')

Real hot girl shit
It ain't always about what you like, sometimes it's about what's right

I'd rather be a B.I.T.C.H.

Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect? Well treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me "keep it real" but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come looking for you till I find you
You really want me to whoop the hoe that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lyin', man that's fraud, bruh
Man you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy I been that

Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin' can't depend on a "prolly"
And that's fucked up 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories one-sided
I ain't perfect, and I try to fix the shit that ain't working
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerking
Since you wanna test the waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me, and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you thinking shit get better with another bitch, go get her
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help you

I'd rather be a B.I.T.C.H.
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
