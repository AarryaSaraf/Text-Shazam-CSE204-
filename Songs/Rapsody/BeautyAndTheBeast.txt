Album: BeautyAndTheBeast

// Feel It //

Guys, I'm saving her life and yours. Her presence makes us all vulnerable. I don't want you learning that inconvenient fact under fire. (Master chief?) Seek life elsewhere. (Suck my...)

[Heather Victoria:]
If you feel it, yeah, if you feel it, feel it
If you feel it, yeah

[Rapsody:]
I skip on water, I skate on ice
So if hell froze over then I'd still be nice
You gotta vice for gambling life
Lay down the dice, you find yourself hooked up to device
Like beep beep, uh
That's a weak beat, you good for that
You got the rules of fame confused with the rules of rap
Squad - we like autobots in Idlewild
The future looks amazing, our drive is crazy wild, you crazy child
Watch 'em bite our style like edible arrangements
It could rain mints, I'm still fresher than all of y'all
Linen out the dryer, we don't close pens
Still hanging on every line I spit before ten
Origin, Morrison, you outside The Doors
Waiting on the sun, a daughter came five foot four
Five foot three whichever, what's a inch to yard?
The ruler's back, they all saying the ruler is Rap
Many will nap, counting sheep? I never did that
Leaders lead, followers trail, I never look back
When you this good you never get lapped
Widen the gap like plus sizes somewhere in the back
I'm too big for your britches, I ain't never been slapped
Got palms in my face, they like "where y'all at?"
A way more elegant spot where you can't wear caps
That's a metaphor my level advanced
You class Afro-American McCants
You can't, uh, the race ain't fair
It's like you started back there, boy, I'm way up here
And still faster, I could sneeze and beat you by a light year
It's nothing, gear up, it's like police out here
'Cept I'm aiming at the ones rocking the same big gear
Rest y'all no threat like some fathers
Disappear when she crowned, boy, I'm like McGyver
You can't be trapped when ya mind like a driver's
Boy, I been woke for many, many, many mileage
You'll never be as fly as me no matter who ya stylist
Boy, this what style is, baby, this what style is
Boy, this what style is, baby, this what style is
Open up your eyelids
I can see the envy like Badu's green iris, I do what I wanna
I'm borderline Madonna
The Queen of Pop Pop aiming at these pop warners
Knock ya helmet off your shoulders then I peel off like bananas
I keep it so real you could call me Marlanna
A dead poet, this my will of fortune, no Vanna
I see the game you playing, competition never honest
Got pressure on your back while I never left the sauna
Hot flow, that's aight though, take it as a warning
Dearly beloved we're gathered here this morning
Till death do us part, expect ya family some mourning
The game ain't the same and all y'all like Lauren
With the last name foreign acting New New for 'em
And I ain't Korean, but I know I been nailin' it
They feeling all hurt, why you acting all delicate?
You gotta problem with me you should write to your delegates
I'm a Jedi, no emotion, now they call me Bill Belichick
But I ain't feeling patriot, America racist
Talking 'bout hoods that America made, shit
Understand the truth when you hear it
And understand the booth is where we spit mo' mirrors
Reflections of it all
Just keeping it real with y'all
Ya feel me?

[Heather Victoria:]
If you feel it, yeah, if you feel it, feel it
If you feel it, yeah

// Who I Am //

[Rapsody (Heather Victoria):]
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)

[Rapsody:]
Hate my weaknesses
45's on the bars like I'm on that yard, federal
Want some new leather, I'm better weather bound
I8 like oh my, I'm down like a low high, aloha
A low ha when they talk crazy, buenos nochas
All of us is ovals, circle one, that's perfect
I ain't seen an nawh' one like my mama closed the curtain
Don't be flirtin' with your gift, you better marry it - you nervous?
Don't be scared of euurk euurk nothing
I'm scratching those been fronting
Never played the lottery like y'all, most of that's worth nothing
Got no time or money to be wasting, honey, honey
Auntie shared some wisdom, say in life you must be cunning
You must be stunting with a body like "good God"
I ain't got the best, but ain't nobody like "who ya?"

[Rapsody (Heather Victoria):]
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am
They know who I am

[Heather Victoria:]
They know who I wake up being every morning
Everyday I wake up lacing my Jordan
They know who I wake up being every morning
They know who I wake up being every morning

[Rapsody (Heather Victoria):]
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am
They know who I am

[Rapsody:]
You don't know me, but you know me
Faith is believing in something they'll never show me
I respect LeBron, but I love me some Kobe
It's something about a winner, you gotta be winter, I'm cold, see
Respect to all old Gs
I keep my soul like an old Raphael Saadiq speech
Lack masculinity, I miss you
Sad they call it hate when we speak on some of them issues
But we can't go ssshhh no more
I'm just trying to be all I can be for y'all
Cause Ruby Dee and Maya's gone
And we gotta keep the fire strong
Back when my hair was long
And I was 100 pounds watching Viacom
New the powers of words
Rapping about more than what cars we on
Zim Zimmer, who got the keys to the Beamer?
I like to party too, who got balloons and some streamers?
I dream of arenas like Arenas playing in
But they say that the music I'm making ain't paying many dollars
My purpose is priceless, lah lah
La La Anthony got hazel eyes
See the world the same in brown and green
Think money make you, you I'll advised
We can't change color like dyes
So make music like this so you don't forget
And always remember and recognize who you are (who you are)

[Rapsody (Heather Victoria):]
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
They know who I am (They know, oh, oh)
(They know, oh, oh)

// Hard To Choose //

It's when you walk out on faith
Choose to do what feel right, let everyone else trace
What we chase ain't the same
I'm still that rapper that your favorite rapper scared to rap after
Sometimes it's hard to chill, choose to kill, kill, kill, kill
I'm just that good though I ain't worth a lot of millions
When you rap this well a lot of rappers catch feelings
We all want the best, don't let a female kill 'em, yeah
Hard to choose culture over fame
You just want to be set and take care of all your fame
It don't make you, but it be cool to have money like Wayne
Take the shorter roads so the family ain't worrying
Chose to build it slow, ain't no need, no hurrying
It's hard to be political, can't say what's on your brain
Careers come quick, it's just as fast to bury 'em
But I chose to give a damn
And box for you like pictures on Instagram
Chose to respect what was built by both Kool and Bam
You know who I am, word to my homie Wyann
Shit, ain't hard to choose me there's only one me, man
(So hard to choose)
That's why I chose to be that
Because where I'm from it ain't cool to be wack
And I'm so pro-black
Though they don't choose me back and that's some choosy shit
Why it's so hard to choose y'all over these jewels and whips
Welcome to my side
When you look in the crowd the minority's never white
I appreciate y'all, but I'm lying if it don't bite
Cause I love all races but we gotta raise 'em
Cause I know the scale tipped ain't in no black girl's favor
Hey y'all, we all outcasts, these black girls favor
The blonde Barbie and scars, we all gotta save 'em
No love lost for whites, Latinos and the Asians
Loyal to all, but when I look at these black girls faces
I understand why I chose to be better, not basic
So it's not, not (hard to choose)
Yeah, so excuse if I don't care if hipsters relate
It weren't for you at all, at all why these songs were made
Like you were overlaid at the airport
And missed your sort of take off
Don't understand why we get naked or
Why it's hard to choose being real or being fake, huh?
Cause the world worship people that get their cake up
But I chose to De La Soul and raise the stake up
Now why is it (so hard to choose)?
Yeah, seldom support our own, I helped myself by advancement
Want to make sure our daughters have better chances
But y'all in that show and watching videos
Why it's hard to choose class or let them titties show
But it's better for my heart, honey, like Cheerios
And secondly more comfortable doing [?]
Trying to build you up like I went to Lowe's and bought a lot
MC Lyte, I ain't forgot what you told me
I ain't Hovy, but damn
It's hard to choose being humble or going HAM
Humility's a weakness, I was told different
Quietest in the room is the baddest one like Durant
It's hard to choose Carolina over Atlanta
Chicago, LA, especially in Johannesburg
Yeah, cause it's been love since beginnin'
Home away from home, versus homes we get no spins in
Why it's (so hard to choose)?
Being super lyrical or slowing it down
Will they understand the metaphors and how they compound
With the two lines before and the next three after?
And ask myself does this shit, if it even still matter?
The joints y'all tripping on are so easy and average
And the ones I respect all got that gift mastered
I don't want to compromise my sick self for a master
But it's (so, so hard to choose)
Cause if I don't I'm not cool and I'm boring
Should add a tsch tsch to my beats to be current
This the shit I think about along with image and earnings
But when Nas tell me "God you killin' it" then I'm burning
All thoughts chasing y'all, man, it's easy now
XXL ain't tripping, Time calmed me down
Thinking where we all started from and where we all sitting now
Shit I see it different now, why it's not, not (hard to choose)

// Drama //

Billie Holiday, I sing your blues
Bet your life against me and I swear to God you'll lose it
Muthafuck the cops we still singin' for St. Louis
Super easy flow, shit I could do it while I'm snoozin'
Trippin' off the dope again like Pookie out of rehab
Talkin' money you ain't got, steady makin' me laugh
Call it funny paper like a Sunday praisin' Jesus
The world goin' apes again, I swear we need a Caesar
I told him I ain't single he still ask me can I see ya
I told him he ain't too smart why them other ladies D ya
Your scorin' inefficient, I'm just talkin' business
Numbers never lie when you been shootin' high percentage

Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go call the cops on us I'mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don't make 'em bring out them llamas
Go 'head

Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go call the cops on us I'mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don't make 'em bring out them llamas
Go 'head

It's intense when your color this immense
Throwing shade so much a nigga never needed tent
Either way it's darker, I save myself a couple cents
I'm smarter than the average, we just talkin' bout the rent
Home of the free uh, livin' in America
Cold, cold world I guess we all is Nancy Kerrigan
Thought they'd let you skate through, or run like Marion
Let you reach your goal and then they call you ol' arrogant
Jordan '85 and shit, break a foot in all they asses
Book sense, common sense, that's two separate kind of classes
I'm just in another space, you just on the same planet
Range shootin' out at things, I ain't talkin' the Atlantic
Call me Plymouth Rock baby, no thanks given though
Only thing I'm thinkin' now is how to flip another flow
I ain't talkin' commercials though, I know I'm talkin' progressive
So over your heads my homie said count your blessings up
It's about ten I see and I ain't speakin' Memphis
Talkin' bout patience, gifts, friendship bein' relentless
Boy I got some wings and I ain't speakin' on Bentleys
But if I ever get one you know I'm whippin' on Indie
500, hunnid, I tell you mu'suckas I'm comin'
Whether man or you woman, boy I'm a beast if you frontin'
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back to your front and
Bring it back, rewind, it's nuthin' to shine, so I

Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go call the cops on us I'mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don't make 'em bring out them llamas
Go 'head

Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go 'head (go 'head), go 'head (go 'head)
Go call the cops on us I'mma go start some craziness drama
Tryna be patient Obama don't make 'em bring out them llamas
Go 'head

// Waiting On It (Baby Girl) //

[Rapsody:]
Uh, I ain't Amish, but yo I promise
When I'm in the field you can bet I'm gon' keep it honest
Suspend you in time like self portraits, I guess I'm Mona
A perfect picture of what you get when you really on it, focused
Wrote it knowing you wouldn't probably get what I quoted
Off gate, it's just bait, when you get it late, bam, it's over
Bam, it's over, we taking back what we showed them
I know the routine, I'm a giant on giant shoulders
I see farther than that little midget that Jay Hova had quoted
And yeah I wrote it, more scary now that you know it
Uh, yeah, I'm pitching dope off, no squares
No blocks, been hot so who cares?
What the hell you driving? We still thriving
Your money don't make me money, honey, I'm still diving
Breaking water that's labor for all the daughters
I've been working so when they older everything's back in order
Rap-sody, more heat, yo Chachi
Tell these niggas they ain't fucking with us
I went to masses, told them my classes higher
No need to harass them, they say when you touch fire
They won't do it again, when you learn it burn like IYAAAH
It's funny when I think prior
You thought you was the shit, now you just may have to retire
Call me sire or

Uh, I play chess, uh, and jump checkers

You get played lowkey, I'm more thorough than all your records
You make moves to make money
I make money from all my methods
Man whew, and my crew make all the best shit
That's Eric G on it, whew
I rose like your face to make up for shit that you do
Bust Smith & Wessons, I'm a weapon to those wept on you

// The World //

If I ruled the world I'd be Caesar the Wise One
Give a damn about your life, I guess I blew eyes, son
They saw me as a flash in the pan, now back in their ass
Could beat your whole squad and I don't need guns
Where you coming from? The movies? You'll see my angle?
Correlation? Like Farrakhan in The Nation
Y'all all crazy
All brothers got my back, ask Soul, Jabari, Jason
I mean Problem and that's a problem
That you all gon' be faced with
You Asaic basic, send a thank you to Viacom
You would've never made it inside the basement
That's hierarchy, it's like riding a Harley
You gotta reach to touch my bars, baby, I'm Marley
No bobbin', you couldn't miss me like an RV
In a bicycle lot, when I pop you need McCartney's
Paul bearers, I swear I seldom played with Barbies
No shots, cold cases at my bars see, ha ha
All the cadavers in Israel, it's pitiful
War is ugly, how we kill kids over these pedophiles?
My stomach growls of hunger for wisdom from the owls
Wrap my body in towels like Ghandi and tell you all to bow
Wow wow, yippie yi, yippie yay, my bite's bigger than growl
And I swear there ain't no single day they don't pray for us, uh uh
Back when y'all was talkin' bout y'all was number one stunners
I had my gun up mentally on some uh uh
Surrounded my circumference with homies that wouldn't stunt us
Yeah, you gotta grow, baby
Kobe, I'm the bean, I'm down to lead 'em to heaven maybe
Watch us all rise, I got them screaming like "Jesus, lady"
Rapsody, please save me
I'm the beauty and the beast, the last third's amazing
Cautious, stop, go back, she's like flags Jamaican
I swear if my kind rule half of y'all wouldn't make it
It's Rap

A sin that be this nice and took a bite out of Apple's logo

I could flip it like Rodman, you a rebound, a vitamin
Boy I'm lethal as lidocaine, up the wall I been spatterin'

Not quite but damnit I'm on his right and

I woke up feeling like a million dollars
Woke up yesterday, damn, had a million problems
She say life still going on and on, baby, keep smiling
Address nothing today like you ain't got a thousand Island
Call my friends now we wildin', having fun, nonviolent
Find a little balance, got me feeling like I'm Alice
In wonderland, yeah, beautiful view
Riding through the street listening to my favorite
Didn't ya know I was gon' bring it? I never disappointed before
Like D Rose with new knees I'm back on point, no joke
You missed me the most, some others felt the need to divorce
Hip hop it go pop, but I love this blackness
And for record me and Jean already got a record
Random, yeah, yeah, better rapping I do
Riding through the street listening to old Badu
Yeah, out my mind just in time
Geniuses are borderline crazy says my mind
Hell, I gave 'em plenty signs, yeah, all throughout my rhymes
Now they calling me Future, I'm so ahead of my time
When I came out the womb my mind was mentally 9
Out of order till I'm back at one, I'm tryna reach Brian
Your favorite, kiss me on my neck and my spine
Late nights listening my favorite

// The Man //

[Heather Victoria:]
Cause he's... the man...

[Rapsody (Heather Victoria):]
Of the house since his dad left, wake up, days feeling stressed
No stability, every year got a new address
Never change the view from this window, he seeing mad arrest
He saw his homie's death, same age, same story
Questioned God, wonder why he would take a such young shorty
It ain't even 8:40, already he thinking poorly
But still he's the (maaaaan)
His mom trust him now to lock the place down
Feed his younger brother and sister, make sure they both lay down
'fore she home, can't be on the phone, gotta wake up early next morn'
He don't have a lot of fun having to be so grown
At night he pray the world just throw him a bone
Tired and stressed
His grades suffer now and they don't know about home
So his teachers on his back again and don't own Foams
Kids pick at him, now he feel he need those to belong
Daydreaming 'bout a life living just like Puff Combs
On his walk to the crib he always hear several blown
Tryna think positive, but everything's wrong
Why his daddy can't be at home and be the mutherfucking (maaaaan)?
Now he gotta a little plan
He can sell a few rocks, maybe make a few grands
Take his family and move 'em and expand 'em to better lands
And be the motherfuckin, and be the motherfuckin (maaaaan)

[Heather Victoria:]
Cause he's... the man...

[Rapsody:]
So he got money and stayed, but ain't get out
Got a new whip now he pushing worth 50 thous'
But his mom, brother, sister still living in public housing
He the man though, gotta put food in all they mouths
His dad skipped, now he's the one to provide they outfits
They won't get picked on like he did, under the couch is
A 9 Milli, he gotta protect the fam, silly
Under circumstances he living to be the man really
Dad dropped by out the blue, he said "damn, you ain't the (maaaaan)"
Look what I did fam
When you ain't bother I stepped up to be the man, man
Now I'm the (maaaaan)
Be out, yo, this my motherfuckin' house
See, I'm the (maaaaaaan)
Around the way I don't respect ya
You just clown to me, yo, I reject ya
You gave me all this pressure, I wasn't even a freshman
Since thirteen man, shit, dawg, I been the (maaaaan)

[Heather Victoria:]
Cause he's... the man...

[Rapsody:]
Now this street life got him running always thinking 'bout the (maaaan)
And now he sets the scene of what he saw when he was ten
Out the window while he sat thinking like (maaaaaan)
I wish It could better, man
I could be a doctor, a teacher, a lawyer talking evidence
Or I could be your weather(maaan)
I had dreams and plans, but gave it up to be the man, see
When my father didn't bother, well, now I'm the (maaaan)

[Heather Victoria:]
Cause he's... the man...

[Rapsody:]
I pray to God you get it soon, I use Vidal Sassoon to clear my head
Shower and devour stress, I chose to wear a dress today
I got small breasts, but I love me (but I love me)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
He says yes he does, I'm his everything
I don't think love's in a wedding ring, it's a business
And I hear both sides lose interest
What's endless hasn't ended
And I'm thinking damn, is this you and me one day?
I don't wanna fade away (f-fade away, f-fade away, f-fade away...)
Like a history, rock and roll, hip hop now but so soul
Soul is what y'all singin'
Long as they payin', to newborns just a day in
Gotta make their life amazing
Don't let the TV raise 'em, raise 'em, raise 'em
Tell 'em how we black as ravens, ravens, yea
But they hatin' and they shoot us
When we march they call us looters
Sitters, says "go get your rugers (get your rugers)"
Yea, used to have a peaceful mindset
But nowadays peace won't come and justice or a bomb threat
Is how I feel, I need God to heal my heart
How we s'possed to not fight back?
Now we s'possed to not wage war?
I pray to God you get it soon
Another afternoon, different day same story
More convos in our living rooms, huh, nah, we don't need Maury
Yea, confirming all your lies
It's hard to tell our babies they don't care about our lives
Ask us why, they ask us why, why, why, why, why?
They ask us why, why, why, why, why?

[Children:]
"Why don't people like me because of my color?"
"I don't understand"
"Why am I different?"
"Why doesn't my life matter?"
"I'm just like you"
"I'm no different"
"I'm a good kid"
"I like to play"
"I like to hang with my friends"
"Why is the world not in peace?"
"Yes"
"My dad said"
"When I get bigger"
"I have to be really careful"
"Around police"
"But why?"
"I thought police help us"
"I don't understand"
"I don't understand"

"Hello"
"I just want to say hello"

// Coming For You //

I am one of the most consistent, respected in the business
My name make 'em shiver when you whisper it
I'm sleeped on
Times said it's my time and all the G's know
From the east to the west coast, Nas said I had a blessed flow
I'm sleeped on
Got it mixed like pico, barge in like Chico
Choke your chief now I'm the leader of all your people
I'm sleeped on
Give peace though, you think a piece of my teeth
As I tear through and feed your ego
Unhappy as CeeLo, for real

Cut the rules off
The new rules, ain't no rules, I'm the new law
These the keys to all the real bars
First you gotta learn control to play the game like P-4
This ain't Fifa, or Brazil real
Silly mind said beat it him or hers, no drill
But a tool I still use so often
It's like the hammer to put the nail in the coffin
No discrimination, even whites say awesome
With your Rick Ross need a doctor lookin' like Boston
No rules against flossin' I shine through the winters and monsoons
The fearful never know what I'm gon' do
Call it Luol Deng in here, that's a nine heat
A beast, a flower, bringin' slow singin' like 9 beats
That's a metaphor, I mean simile, but understand we ain't similar
I keep the letter for, it's never offensive
It's critical thinking why I feel so intensive
I could do it all night boy, never is endless
Keep my ear to the streets like rims is
Yea, uh, invincible like 4 arms
A slam dunk, it's a message to the forearms
You been forewarned, I'm a beast, uh
I keep J's like 41's on my feet son
You need 4 wands, magic in the forum
Or just pass it to and got him like oh I'm
So sick and this flow type ridiculous
I got 'em singin' like

I am one of the most consistent, respected in the business
My name make 'em shiver when you whisper it
I'm sleeped on
Times said it's my time and all the G's know
From the east to the west coast, Nas said I had a blessed flow
I'm sleeped on
Got it mixed like pico, barge in like Chico
Choke your chief now I'm the leader of all your people
I'm sleeped on
Give peace though, you think a piece of my teeth
As I tear through and feed your ego
Unhappy as CeeLo, for real

Ain't a choir but get acquired
Dress for success and defeat it in my attire
Stay lifted, I'm terrific kid like 4th graders
I want a love like Ruby and the mayor, yea
Every day out the bed rise, from Snow Hill to Bed-Stuy
L.A. and worldwide, I stay fly like bow-ties
What up Carlie, that's the hustle, hype don't mean a thing
You can ask Phillip and Russell
Third quarter I'm back
It's a fact, y'all in trouble, Seahawks cold comin' bruh
I'm a cold woman, bruh, I'm a cold woman
Yea, I been wiggin' and now it's Salt Lakes
You know a lotta sadness and a lotta hate
I got a better catalogue than the one with the H
Rapsody, easy exercise y'all bent outta shape
Lyrical flex on, welcome back the faculty
The ruler's back, ain't too many comin' after me

I am one of the most consistent, respected in the business
My name make 'em shiver when you whisper it
I'm sleeped on
Times said it's my time and all the G's know
From the east to the west coast, Nas said I had a blessed flow
I'm sleeped on
Got it mixed like pico, barge in like Chico
Choke your chief now I'm the leader of all your people
I'm sleeped on
Give peace though, you think a piece of my teeth
As I tear through and feed your ego
Unhappy as CeeLo, for real

// Forgive Me (I'm Sorry) //

[Heather Victoria:]
I don't know what to do
Don't you dare to deny it, I'm always reminded of you

[Rapsody:]
I apologize for rapping over heads
Being so classic, forgive me
For making it look so easy
I'm sorry, I don't care about TV
I apologize for rapping over heads
Lord Jah, forgive me
This hip hop is so in me
Quick please, forgive me
I apologize for rapping over heads
Being so classic, forgive me
For making it look so easy
I'm sorry, I don't care about TV
I apologize, I apologize, I apologize, I apologize

[Heather Victoria:]
I don't know what to do
Don't you dare to deny it, I'm always reminded of you

[Rapsody:]
I'm reminded of my shape
When I'm around y'all ain't straight
I'm sorry I'm so great that most of y'all don't relate
Metaphor so deep, trying to give them credit like Chase
But I know that time's wasting, I'm sorry I cold faced it
All my jams ain't party hits, I'm thinking about modern racism
I'm thinking 'bout Mike Brown, what my nephew might have to face it
I don't talk about it
Sorry, I'm so classy, I don't come up out this bra
I don't have to, I'm so raw
And I got a younger bruh, pray he's never murdered by law
I'm sorry I don't applaud for the times to talk about God
I'm sorry I walk around looking coonish to be a star
And you wearing medium when you really need extra large
Just to fit in, I'm sorry, I'm offending, I got these bars
Sorry, I'm not nominated for BET awards
When you be E.T. they alienate all you from your star power
Shitting on the game like my stomach sour, eww
I'm sorry I had to throw in that for simple appeal
I'm sorry my label is killing it with no majors, no deal
Funny how the ones selling records are the ones rapping for real
Future sold 100, Kendrick sold a hot mill
You do the math and take a bath in salt water, I hope you heal

[Heather Victoria:]
I don't know what to do
Don't you dare to deny it, I'm always reminded of you

[Rapsody:]
(I'm sorry)
I ain't beefing with these sisters
(I'm sorry)
I don't get off on wearing designer zippers
I ain't watching stupid television by these niggas
We talking Love & Hip Hop I'm thinking 'bout Brown Sugar
I'm more into sports, tobacco road
Famous don't appeal to me when I'm touring the globe
So it don't hurt me so much I ain't heard on radio
I'm sorry my respect level got nothing to do with Vogue
What you know? I'm sorry
I don't do this for Ferrari's
I'm sorry I got a lane and don't need to copying Rari
I'm sorry I don't act like them
And I don't got no problems with Black Jesus being on Adult Swim
What you know? I'm sorry, I ain't sorry
For none of this shit I wrote
Robin Williams died today so you need to hear this the most
Money and fame don't bring no one happiness, that's a quote
Mo' money, mo' problems - you know how that shit go
I'm sorry, they won't play me like old Atari's
My general small, but production team be scarry
I know it's far from fair
Sorry y'all don't catch my lines like Jordan dropped the blue pair

// Don't Need It //

[Merna:]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

[Rapsody:]
I woke up satisfied
I'll never let your negativity kill my vibe
I know everybody's dreams don't survive
That's the difference between me and them in this life
Everybody talk a lot
I remember not to follow what they talk about
I know I'm the illest out, sheep gon' be sheep
So I know you'll come around in time
They always do, they don't ever let you down
Talking about everything you need except the crown
Your gift and your passion to them don't ever count
'Til your name and life and money overflowing in accounts
All you bitches look like clowns

[Merna:]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

[Rapsody:]
"Yo, let me apologize for the other types that made you feel like you could ever steal my light
Joy always come in the morning no matter what the night do
Might not be today, but one day they gon' understand you"
I don't need that drama, I don't need to give you light
I was taught: don't give energy to those you don't like
I don't need to go major, made it this far without paper
I don't need that cover either, I don't need none of your favors
Told my mama "We gon' make it", I don't need your funds
I don't need to get naked, I just need to have some fun
I don't need your emo beats, all I want is soul and funk
I don't need your validation, hell, I already done won

[Merna:]
It's here in your own star
Once you wake up and realize who you are
'Til we know, we don't need it
I don't need it

[Rapsody:]
My confidence out the roof
Aquarius in me told me opinions ain't truth
This amusement wasn't amusement for you
When it's showtime I'm on like Kobe Bryant in his youth
I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman, I'm Birdman
My play is not to make you opinions my burden
Whoo! Uh, Damn, Michael Keaton
Shoot the nose to spite the face, I ain't even
Mama say there's more success in succeeding
My complexion in the black this evening
That's the prop that I'm teaching business
Santa Clause to Jehova's Witness
Ain't believe, now they want forgiveness

[Merna:]
Fuck what them say, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
I don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
I don't need it

// For You //

You left me wildin', fallin' for you
I don't know what to do, wildin', fallin' for you

Ain't a secret I ain't told you that you don't know about me
Things my family don't know about me
Listen to me verbatim, bring it up in arguments so you win
Hell, at least you listenin' like Drake, all over the influence
I'm so into you, you grown as hell
But we joke and we play like we twelve
That's a friendship, kinship, black Barbie-Ken shit
Love you cause you make me laugh
Spendin' trips never bought me, taught me
Money don't make me cool or nothin'
They cool with stuntin', I'm cool with you
I'm cool that we cool without playin' by none of they rules
Why I fell for you, was told to marry a doctor, lawyer
I want my best friend I felt like nutso jumpin' outside the gym

You left me wildin', fallin' for you
I don't know what to do, wildin', fallin' for you

So many marry the wrong person, know it ain't comical
I take my time like Dre and Jay Electronica
For you, man, I'm just human, niggas wanna be Victor Newman
Just want you to be my new man, love someone I deem honourable
Best friend, lololol laughin'
Every time we ridin' you be like "girl, you better strap in"
Sure you don't wanna lose me? Uh uh, 'specically in no accident
Feelin' possessive nowadays like Cleveland and Akron
You my 23 bae, best shot I got
How I tell my best friend I love him without it being awkward, huh?
They say best friends the best kind, others like "don't do it"
If it goes south your friendship gon' be ruined

You left me wildin', fallin' for you
I don't know what to do, wildin', fallin' for you

// Believe Her //

[Rapsody:]
My guard up nowadays, I don't trust nobody
See what you glorify, I could probly guess what you think about me
What you want from me? Cause you think I got it
Old friends I ain't seen in years be like "Don't forget about me"
That's some other pressure, enough to stress you out
How you gonna save a whole city and you ain't got your mama out?
Questions I ask myself, in my shoes how you pick and choose
To refuse the help when they never loved you neither
But you do it just to keep the peace cause jealousy is evil
Peace less frequently, you just wanna be a needle
In a haystack, hard to find
Protectin' sanity cause all we got is peace of mind
And if you did believe, don't get tainted by the shine
Who are you? The one that get love from that nigga that go "doo, doo, doo!"
Say I'm doing big things, reciting "Gimme the loot!"
But who are?

[Merna:]
When the party's over and everyone is gone
When the world is over and we're all alone
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Will you be around when it all comes down?
Will you be around when it all comes down?

[Rapsody:]
My guard up nowadays, I don't trust nobody
What's true if niggas are lyin', you ask Bill Cosby
Allowin' you like Bill Cosby, I be on some shit
Drinking wasabi, watching Miyagi tryna learn to split
Cause family miss you but time's an issue when they 6
14, 7, 9, you look to 'em for innocence
Everybody's intent ain't the same
Dependin' on perspective, I could be the bad or the good Bane
Backstab you for not lettin' you ride the back of this train
On my coat cause everybody's infatuated with fame, man
I got a feeling that they really don't love me
I got a feeling I'm too dark so they think that I'm ugly
I got a feeling family think I've come into some money
So I've got a feeling I've got new cousins coming to find me
I got a feeling I'm bout to find out how precious time be
I find out everything about time and loyalty from a cosign
And I got a feeling y'all don't know where my mind is
Got a feeling there'll be less questions about how I been
Got a feeling change is comin' in climate and I don't mean rain
Or somethin' holdin' myself up to a promise
Lookin' at reflection tellin' "myself don't lose you
Don't move too quick, be cautious what you walking' into
Be ready all times, the levee might break
Chevy's 'll shake when they hear the shit that I gotta say"
Uh, stakes is high, my folks is poor
My people proud, they live through me
I love 'em when it's said and done I gotta expose my peeps
Cause it's real

[Merna:]
When the party's over and everyone is gone
When the world is over and we're all alone
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Are you a believer? Are you a believer in my Lord?
Will you be around when it all comes down?
Will you be around when it all comes down?
