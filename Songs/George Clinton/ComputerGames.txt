// Man's Best Friend //

Uh-huh, ahh hah! ooh yeah!
Treat me bad, and I'll take it
Throw your ball I'll run and chase it
Fetch you the newspaper
Treat me good, I'll do you tricks
When you need, I'll catch a fix
Love me an' I'm in your favor

I said a dog is man's best friend!
I said a dog is girl's best friend!

Oh, a fox, can be foxy
And brother wolf, he's the guy
Chased red through the woods and ate grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf who made a widower of grandpa
I'm like a St. Bernard to you baby when you're lost out in the snow
I'll be like Santa Claus in the desert
Say you sho' can use some snow
Provin' dog is man's best friend

Ohh, this sounds familiar
Make me stick my nose in there
And see who do I smell, ahahahaha!

Ooh! uh-huh, uh-huh, ahh hah yeah!
Pat my back, pat my back
Pat my back, I'm contented
Watch my tail and I will wag it
Fetch you the newspaper
Extend your hand and I will lick it
Toss a stick, I'll run and get it
For just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Standing guard in the yard

A dog is man's best friend (standing on guard)
A dog is girl's best friend (standing guard in the yard)
A dog is man's best friend (standing on guard)
A dog is girl's best friend (standing guard in the yard)

And don't forget puppy love!
And remember, my bite is rough
Much worse than my bark
An out of control dog, woof!
Tear the roof off!

Dog, is man's best friend, his best friend!
Dog is a woman's best friend
I said dog, is man's best friend

Extend your hand and I will lick it
Toss the stick I'll run and get it
Just a bone I'll be forever in your favor
Standing dog in the yard, guarrrd...

Oh we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on
Oh we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on

Hey hey, oww...

// Loopzilla //

Oh, we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on
Oh, we keep turnin ya on, keep turnin ya on
We, keep turnin ya on

Hey hey, ow!

// Pot Sharing Tots //

[Baby sounds]

If we were just babies
Sharing a cradle
I'd share a suck on my thumb with you

We wouldn't freak out, like the grown-ups do
If I were one, and you were two
I would do a striptease for you

If we were just tots, sharing a pot
I'd share a [?] of my do with you
You'd be pink, and I'd be blue
If I should get wet, you'd get wet, too
If I shared my space with you

[Baby sounds]

You in your carriage
Me in my buggy
Strolling down the avenue

One day when they [?] for tiny tots
I suck my pacifier in a little sandbox
While you suck your thumb there, too
Til they're through

[Baby sounds]

I would crawl before you walk
You would walk before I'd run
And I'd run away with you

[Baby sounds]
