// Bullet Proof //

All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music
Loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain
I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain

I don't want your war
I don't like the boom and bang (ooh)
I don't want to play
I don't like the songs you sing (ooh)

The whole world
Is on red alert
Believe me when I say
No one has to get hurt

I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain (ooh)

La la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la

Everyday I read the paper
There's a brand new hot spot
A so-and-so somewhere
Wanna take what so-and-so's got

I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war

I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war
I don't want your war

All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
All in favor say 'aye'
I ain't bulletproof
I won't wear the ball and chain!
(Not for nobody)

On the subway, everyone's holdin
Even' mugger's gettin mugged
With all they're holdin in
There's no room for love

All around the world
I'd rather be in a band
Playin' my funky music
Loud as I can

I ain't bulletproof!
I won't wear the ball and chain

// Bangladesh //

Are we going to the heaven's height?
Maybe we can fly high
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh

And when after the winter
The spring flowers have bloomed
I was walking in this
Beautiful garden with you
Until I like the way you want me to
I'll remain the prisoner in your dream
Wake!

So are we going to get at home?
They say that you want to come
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh

Like a stopped watch
I wait you here to stay
I'll provide
How I gave you into my heartbeat
Spreading love
Spreading love
Spreading love

So are we going to get at home?
They say that you want to come
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh

// Thrashin' //

Molested
Protested
Arrested
And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres

Fail-safe, defcon
Missiles set to cruise
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

Short range deployment
It promotes long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Never gonna blow a groove
Take cover in the groove
We'll be thrashin' on you

Boom shake la ka la ka boom boom
Shake la ka la ka boom boom boom
Boom shake la ka la ka boom boom
Shake la ka la ka boom boom boom

Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Take no prisoners, show no mercy

Short range deployment
Oh yes, it promotes long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
We'll be thrashin' on you

Thrash, thrash, thrash
Thrash, thrash, thrash
We'll be thrashin' on you
Thrash, thrash, thrash

Take no prisoners, show no mercy
And the missile business booms
On all the mother's hemispheres
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
We'll be thrashin' on you
Molested
Invested
Protested
Ingested
Arrested
And the missile business mushrooms
On all the mother's hemispheres

Short range deployment
It promotes
Long range unenjoyment
Take no prisoners, show no mercy
Oh, no!

Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove
Thrashin'
Mashin'
Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove

And the missile business booms
Say "boom!"
On all the mother's hemispheres
Boom!...

Cashin' on the groove
Never gonna blow a groove
Take cover in the groove

There's no business
Like blow business
Like bomb business
Like boom!

// Some Of My Best Jokes Are Friends //

The world is equal proportions
Of bullseyes and bullshit
They were bullish and they were foolish
Now there's no one to listen when they talk

Adam split the scene on the Eve of destruction
Not unlike the way we split our jeans
But like the way we split our pair of genes
We split the whole world at the seams
Someone call the Space Limousine
Alright

Hitler hit the scene with dreams of destruction
Not knowing what atom splitting means
While he dreamed his mean dreams
The means to his dreams split the scene
Someone call the Space Limousine
Alright

Basic training in the ghetto
Basic training in the ghetto
They talked about your mama and you took it
Where does the logic lie therein?
Some of my best jokes are friends

But like the way we split our genes
We split the whole world, so it seems

Yes
Space Limousine here
I read you loud and clear
Give me coordinates
You see there isn't a second to waste
There's no second, there's no second to waste

All aboard right on time
Before the Mothership
3-2-1-00 countdown
Will climb, will climb

Atom split the scene on the Eve of destruction
Nothing like the way we split a pair of jeans
But like the way we split our genes
We split the whole world at the seams
Someone call the Space Limousine
As a matter of critical mass
Nukes, are not a laughing matter

They talked about your mama and you took it
Where does the logic lie therein?

Bad news about the fuel
We're burning up
We're low on juice
I've said low on juice
So where does the logic lie therein
Some of my best jokes are friends
