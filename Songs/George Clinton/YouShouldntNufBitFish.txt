// Nubian Nut //

King Nut the Nubian Tut
Say follow follow they use their ears
Say follow follow then they use their minds
But when they follow your body
Then they loose their minds
Let me tell you a little story about King Nut
The natives call him the Nubian Tut
Out of 1407 he came to be somewhere around 2000 BC
Well the natives clap for the Nubian sap
Then sit back and listen to the King Nuts rap
Do it!
Shaka do da shaka do da shaka do da
Shaka do da shaka do da shaka do da

I know you hitting be true
Knee deep in the jungle with the coconut groves
Where the tiger and the lion boogie with the rhinos
There's a tribe over here there's a tribe over there
Drums beating funky rhythm, music's everywhere
Doing the Nubian Nut
Say follow follow they loose their ears
Say follow follow then they loose their minds
High high high
Doo doo doo doo doo
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow

King Nubian never got hot before a show
'Cause in the motherland they didn't wear too many clothes
People talk that talk break out the camel walk
Then he wiggle through the jungle just as quick as a hawk
Then he grab his spear then he grab his shield
Show all the native people just how good he feel
Doing the Nubian Nut

Say you got what you got gotten gotten goo ga got
Ho! doing the Nubian Nut
Say follow follow they loose their ears
Say follow follow then they loose their minds
Say follow follow then they loose their mouths

Late at night he'd talk his crap
While soaking his feet in some Nubian sap
He had a bone through his ear and one through his nose
The women in the tribe would massage his toes
Yeah!
When he asks you what's jumpin' it's the peas in the pot
They wouldn't be jumping if the water wasn't hot
Doing the Nubian Nut

Yeah follow follow follow follow
Follow follow follow follow
The people didn't know where the beat was coming from
But they knew it had to be another Nubian drum
King Nut is the future history
Somewhere around 2000 AD
Holding up the shield that's a glowing green
Raising a spear that shoots laser beams
Riding in a spaceship up and down the street
Tooting at the fine women on the block he meet
Throwing down in studios track by track
Letting everybody know the empire strikes back
Another spaceship here another spaceship there
Here a ship there a ship everywhere a mothership
Landing in Detroit at United Sounds
Where all the funkateers like to boogie down
Because most of all we need the funk

Oh uh heh heh heh
Say follow follow they use their ears
Say follow follow then they use their minds
Say follow follow they use their mouths
But when they follow your body
Then they loose their minds
Follow follow follow follow
Follow follow follow follow
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow
Follow follow follow follow
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow
Follow follow follow follow
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow
Follow follow follow follow
Shoo bee doo bee doo dow
Doo dow doo dow doo dow

// Quickie //

As I stepped out of my limousine
A little Mercedes pulled next to me
She was quick and straight to the point
Ah, can I have your number, please?

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

Girl, wanna get next to me, ow
She rushed me home, she can see the dog in me
She said you do it right
Pretty baby, gotta stay all night

Little baby, wanna be your man
Uh, uh this is just a one night stand

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

If you are to make me happy
Got to make it snappy
Make it quick
You know it was a quickie

Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Licking the split, make it quick
Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Make it quick, licking the split

Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Licking the split, make it quick
Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Make it quick, licking the split

She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around

She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

Make it quick, make it quick
Make it quick
Gotta do it right and don't take all night
Gotta do it right and don't take all night

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

She said to make me happy
And make it snappy
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

// Last Dance //

Last dance...

Oh, let your eyes have followed her to the dance floor
Your heart has been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance
Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflowers

Why don't you walk right up n' ask her for her hand
Maybe she'll funk with you
Oh, maybe she'll funk with you

So funky!

Last dance
Last dance

I dance alone and never gaze in her direction
Maybe she'll get funky with you
It does not mean that we did not trade affection
Last dance
By a little degree I always be that open
Last dance
Yes, you let your imagination sworn, hey
Last dance

Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower
Maybe she'll get funky with you...

Now them days and twisted bodies in your psyche
Oh, he's leavin' I'll pay sister
Last dance
You smartly hand you're not dreamin'
Last dance
Maybe she'll get funky with you, ah ah
Last dance

Oh, aren't you meant to be in joy heaven
It would have been, had you gotten with her
It's not so bad after all
It's not biorhythmic, psychoanalitic, profound
It leads a lot of weird dreams

Maybe she'll get funky with you
Sensitivity
Maybe she'll get funky with you...

May I have this dance
Ooh la la la la la la la la la...
The last dance...
Ooh la la la la la la la la la...
The last dance...

Maybe the last dance
You see it's 2 o'clock in the morning
You see, the last dance, hey baby

Last dance
Last dance

Oh, let your eyes have followed her to dance floor
Your heart has been dying to ask her for a dance
It's fair, your eyes began to grew
Your dumb mouth will not take the chance

Well, are you some kinda psychedelic wallflower...

// Silly Millameter //

Time to groove down

Just when I can't face tonight

// You Shouldn't-Nuf Bit Fish //

With the electronic bait
Man, his nuclear fission
And the fish on his line
Is bigger in his mind
Than the reality of the reel
He has to reel it in
You shouldn't-nuf bit fish

Last one to get away
Is the catch of the day
You shouldn't-nuf bit fish
You took the bait
It's too late to pray
Now over you, they say the grace
Lord bless this fish

Bring on the chill
Don't forget the spell
We bit the fish
Brother don't be so quail
Heads or tails
We ate the fish

We ate the chill fifteen day
And don't matter about who is fishin'
Draw attention
And then we take the bait
We got to carry the weight a long time
Carry the weight along time

A little baby waits
With a line attached to his mind
And a hook in his behind
Who do you suppose will bite
Like the fishman night
Are you sleek, are you sly, are you stoned
Or are you fishin' for a song
All these smelly fishy ain't fish
Oh, somebody said "fish it's brain food"
Well, I'm thinkin' about caviar
Fish eggs on brain
Have a little sanity
Gonna raid your house
Saturday night fish fry
The Barracuda are still prime
Do you suppose he will bite
With the line attached to his mind
And a hook in his behind
Put up a good fight
Gimme line, gimme line
Give him time

Last one to get away
Is the catch of the day
You shouldn't-nuf bit fish
You took the bait
It's too late to pray
Lord bless this fish
