I'm ready! How about you?
Ready to do what you like to
Wide open yours tonight
Feeling hot, feeling right

Come on out to own the town
Party top and party sound
Just that kinda cool
I wanna put my hands on you

Can you do it? (do it, do it)
Can you do it tonight? (do it, do it)
Can you feel alright? (do it, do it)

You got me feeling high
I'm above the waiting line

// Don't Stop //

If you wake up and don't wanna smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow

// When It Comes To Love //

Love is never enough (when it comes to love)
Never too much (when it comes to love)
Never was (when it comes to love)
Love is never enough (when it comes to love)
Never too much (when it comes to love)
Never was

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

You don't put me down
Turn me on, turn me on
You only show me love
What life is about
Without any doubt in your mind

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

Your love is a especial type
Always rare on time
Never too hard to find
You love in a especial way
That words can't explain
Love shines in every way
Everyday and always

I'm so glad that you found me
Saved me
Took me in your arms
I'm so glad that you found me
Show me
That love can stand on us all life

When it comes to love
Loving you is never enough
Holding you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Feeling you is never enough
Touching you is never much
Loving you is never wrong

When it comes to love
Loving you is never wrong
Loving you is never much
Ohhh no
Feeling you is never enough
Loving you is never wrong
Touching you is never much
Ohhhh love
Loving you is never wrong

When it, when it, when it comes to love
When it comes to love
When it comes to love
Loving you is never wrong

(Loving you is never enough, never too much
Take me to your heart and mind
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me in your arms, baby
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me to your heart and mind
When it comes to love, when it comes to love
Take me in your arms, baby)

Love is never enough

// Love Disappears //

I was gathering all the things I had to tell you
Then I found there were more things I, I had to hide
Like lovers and tears, doubts and fears inside me, oh yeah
'Cause when you're away, I've nothing to say at all

When you're not here
Love disappears

I was thinking of the last time we lied together
Seems whenever I need you you're across the sea
Pressured by peers
Sometimes it appear you don't want me, no, no, no
'Cause when you're away, I've nothing to say at all, no, no way

When you're not here
Love disappear, ooh yeah

Frame after frame
Dream ends the same without you, oh 'cause love
'Cause when you're away, I've not much to say at all

When you're not here
Love disappears

// Secret World //

I stood in this unsheltered place
Until I could see the face behind the face
All that had gone had left no trace
Down by the railway siding
In our secret world we were colliding
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

So I watch you wash your hair
Underwater, underwear
And the plane flies through the air
Did you think you didn't have to choose it
That I alone could win or lose it
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

In this house of make believe
Divided in two like Adam and Eve
You put out and I receive
Down by the railway siding
In our secret world we were colliding
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

Oh the wheel is turning, spinning round and round
And the house is crumbling but the stairways stand

With no guilt, no shame, no sorrow or blame
Whatever it is, we are all the same
Making it up in our secret world
Making it up in our secret world
Making it up in our secret world
Shaking it up, breaking it up
Making it up in our secret world

Seeing things that were not there
On a wing, on a prayer
In this state of disrepair
Down by the railway siding
In our secret world we were colliding
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

Secret world
Secret world
Secret world...
