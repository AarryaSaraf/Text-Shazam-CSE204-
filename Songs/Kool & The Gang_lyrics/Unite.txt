// Love Come Down //

Girl, seems to me
That we should be together
And, girl, you know I'll give
My heart to you forever
Let's spend some time together

Has seen stormy weather
And, girl, I'll give to you
A love that's true forever
Let's spend the night together

// Better Late Than Never //

I finally realized that I was wrong
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, baby
I wanna make it right before you're gone
I'd be so lonely, yes, I would, yes, I would
And what a price to pay
For all those nights and days
That we had spent together trying to hold on
A moment of confusion and a lifetime of regret
A chance that I'd be losing
The best that's happened yet, oh...

Better late than never
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
We're gonna work things out
Yes, we are, yes, we are, yeah
Better late than never, ooh...
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
Better late than never, baby
We can work it out
'Cause we still have time

I'm glad to see it means as much to you
As it does to me
Maybe we can celebrate our victory
Over our past
We'll work it out, baby, yes, we can
I didn't even notice
That you were suffering from neglect
While I was out there playing the games of life
I was losing all your respect, whoa...

Better late than never
(Better late, better late)
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
We're gonna work things out right now, hey, baby
Better late than never, yeah
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
Ooh, it's too late for love's never too late, yeah

Better late than never
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
It's not too late, we can make it great
Oh, babe, oh, babe, oh, babe, whoo!
Better late than never
(Never too late)
Better late than never, whoa-whoa...
(Oh, better late)
And I mean what I'm saying
From the bottom of heart and my soul
Trust me, baby, trust me, my love

(Better late, better late than)
Mmm-mm-mm-mm-mm...
(Better late, better late than never)
I've got so much to give ya
Please, baby, come on
(Better late, better late than)
Come on, come on, come on, oh-oh-oh...
(Better late, better late than never)
It's not too late for love, oh, baby
Better late than never, never
Never too late, yeah
