// Fruitman //

Here comes the fruitman,
Bringing fruit from the land
Here come the fruitman, 
Bringing vegetables from the land

When you see the fruit truck come through
The Fruitman always asks you
What can I, I do for you
I have watermelons, red ripe tomatoes
Apples and oranges, Idaho potatoes

So look and see what you see
I only bring things naturally
You know you gotta eat to live
So your body can give you more to give
So eat naturally, and you will see the difference

Here comes the fruitman, 
Bringing fruit from the land
Here come the fruitman, 
Bringing vegetables from the land

When you see the fruit truck come through
The Fruitman always asks you
What can I, I do for you
I have watermelons, red ripe tomatoes
Apples and oranges, Idaho potatoes

So look and see what you see
I only bring things naturally
You know you gotta eat to live
So your body can give you more to give
So eat naturally, and you will see the difference

Here comes the fruitman,
Bringing fruit from the land
Here come the fruitman, 
Bringing vegetables from the land

So look and see what you see
I only bring things naturally
You know you gotta eat to live
So your body can give you more to give
So eat naturally, and you will see the difference

// Rhyme Tyme People //

Strange places you've never been before
No smiling faces to help along the way
Your mind seems to be an open door
What's it for, whoa-oh...

Try to find a way to clean up your mind
Your lovely mother can't always dig a change
Over how your whole lifestyle has been so rearranged
Round and round the changes you go through
It's what you wanna do, whoa-oh...

Wanna do
It's what you wanna do
What you wanna do, whoa-oh...
What you wanna do

No, no, no, no, no

You should be cool
When you're foolin' with that stuff

Strange chances are poppin' in the air
Them rhyme tyme people, you can always find them there
Your mind is all about a doubt
You just can't work it out, whoa-oh...

Just can't work it out
Just can't work it out, whoa-oh...
Just can't work it out, whoa-oh...
Strange chances are poppin' in the air
Strange places you've never been before

Rhyme tyme people
Rhyme tyme people
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-woo-woo-woo
What you wanna do
What you wanna do

You should be cool, cool, cool
When you're foolin' with that stuff

// Light Of Worlds //

In the darkness, of this world
Please give us your light...

Someone's watching
But you can't see
Don't you know what he's after?
In the pool hall
Behind the 8 ball
Can't you see who he's after?
Someone's praying
But they keep playing
With their lives
They don't want them
If by sundown
They all can't be found
I don't know what will happen

We should try to understand
To help our brothers all we can
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, light of worlds

Someone's listening
But you can't hear
Don't you know what he's after?
In the alley (go, go, Sally)
Can't you see what he's after?
Someone's crying
But they keep lying
With their lives
They will play some
Look who's running
Who's that hiding?
Don't you know what he's after?

We should try to understand
To help our sisters all we can
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, won't you share the light?
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, won't you share the light?

In the darkness of this world
Please give us your light...

// You Don't Have To Change //

I walked (I walked and walked)
Like a zombie in the night
You came (you came, you came)
And you brought me back to life
I tried so hard (I tried, I tried)
To become the one you need
But now you think that you're not enough for me

You don't have to change for me
I love you just the way you are
I'd rather change the sun and the moon
Or see December's snow in June

// Higher Plane //

Higher, higher
Higher, higher

Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you

Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(High, high, high, high, high, high)
Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you

High, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high, high
Yeah, yeah

We've been down too long
Gettin' down too strong

Nothing never remains the same

Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(Higher plane, higher plane, higher plane, higher plane)
Gotta keep on liftin', liftin', liftin', liftin' you
(Higher plane, higher plane, higher plane, higher plane)

High, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high
High, high, high, high, high

// Summer Madness //

Summer madness
Summer madness

Summer madness
Summer madness

Summer madness
Summer madness

Summer madness
Summer madness

// Here After //

Here after
When freedom, justice and equality will ring in the hearts and in the minds of all men.
Here after
When man has consumed knowledge, wisdom and understanding from what he has overlooked for so long.
Yes, there will be peace for all, here after.

Here after, when hate is gone
Here after, we'll sing a song of love
Here after, when hate is removed
Here after, no fear.. No fear
Just love

Here after
