// Flame In My Heart //

You cheated on me (you cheated me)
I tried to be fair (I tried to be fair)
But you don't believe enduring your share
But I've learned my lesson (I've learned my lesson)
And now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me like they used to do
Your arms only chill me I'm glad that we're through
My heart was once yearning (my heart was once yearning)
But now I can say (now I can say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
You fool me a while (you fool me a while)
You thought you were wise (you thought you were wise)
You even believed I fell for your life
But the trick's turned on you (the trick's turned on you)
Now gladly I say (now gladly I say)
The flame in my heart is dying away is dying away
Your kisses don't thrill me...
