// Cold, Cold Heart //

You don't know who I am,
But I know all about you;
I've come to talk to you tonight,
About the things I've seen you do.

I've come to set the record straight,
I've come to shine the light on you;
Let me introduce myself,
I am the cold hard truth.

There is a woman we both know,
I think you know the one I mean;
She gave her heart and soul to you,
You gave her only broken dreams.

You say you're not the one to blame,
For all the heartaches she's been through;
I say you're nothin' but a liar,
And I'm the cold hard truth.

All your life that's how it's been,
Looking out for number one;
Taking more than you leave,
Moving on when your done.

With her you could have had it all,
A family and lots of laughs;
If you had any sense at all,
You'd go and beg her to come back.

You think that you're a real man,
But you're nothing but a fool;
The way you run away from love,
The way you try to play it cool.

I gonna say this just one time,
Time is running out on you;
You best remember me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth.

You best remeber me my friend,
I am the cold hard truth...

// Frozen Heart //

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
Needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and warm it with your love
I can't count the times I've hide my face
Tryin' just to be in your warm embrace
The winter of life has fallen at my door
If you said I don't love you any more

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
I'm needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and won't you warm it with your love...

// Talk To Me Lonesome Heart //

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru my darkest gloom
Help me bring her mem'ry to this lonely room

Talk to me and let me cry the whole night thru
You have lost, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright

Talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Talk about the love I miss
Talk to me about the lips I used to kiss

Tell me how she used to smile
Just before she said goodbye
Talk to me, oh lonesome heart, while I cry

Talk to me and let me cry the whole night thru
You have lost, yes, but I've lost as much as you
So talk to me, oh lonesome heart
Help me thru this lonely night
Lie to me and tell me ev'rything's alright...
