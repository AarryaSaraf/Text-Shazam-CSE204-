// Magic Valley //

I'm going home to magic valley where hay turns into rose
I'm going home to magic valley leaving for my home above
Now don't you cry because I'm leaving for you see I've had my day
I've led the life that's not for grieving so rejoice with me and pray
For I hear my Lord telling me put down that heavy load
You'll reach your gold now follow me come on up the golden road
For I hear my Lord telling me...
