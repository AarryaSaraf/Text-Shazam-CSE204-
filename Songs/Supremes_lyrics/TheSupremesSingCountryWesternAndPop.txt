// Funny How Time Slips Away //

Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doingÂ ?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems like only yesterday

Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away

How's your new loveÂ ?
I hope that she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you'd love her 'till the end of time
Now that's the same thing
You told me
Seems like the other day

Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away

Well it's been nice seeing you
Gotta go now
Guess I'll see you around
Don't know when tho'
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember 
What I tell you
In time you're gonna pay

Gee, ain't it funny
How time slips away

// My Heart Can't Take It No More //

Stop hurting me
Now don't you think you're overdoing it
I still care I must admit
I know that if we ever break up
I know you'll never make up
And I'm sorry, so sorry
But my heart can't take it no more

How the times you lied
You know how many times I cried
Lonely tears brought me misery
Maybe one day you realize
Just how I really tried
Darling to make you happy

I gave my heart
You only took it and destroyed it
And now you say it's me you love
Yet you cheated and deceived me
And now you say you want to keep me

And I'm sorry, so sorry
But my heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no more
My heart can't take it no more

// It Makes No Difference Now //

It makes no difference now
What kind of life fate hands me
I'll get along without you
Now that's plain to see

I don't care what happens next
But I'll get by somehow
And I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted
I can't believe we're through
And I don't blame myself
And I'm sure I can't blame you

I know something had to happen
And it happened somehow
And I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now

After all is said and done
I'll soon forget you
Although I know it will be so hard to do
Let things happen as they will
I'll get by somehow

I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now
Not now

Let things happen as they will
I'll get by somehow
I don't worry 'cause
It makes no difference now

// You Didn't Care //

You didn't care
Or you wouldn't have walked away
I realize now you must care less every day
Like a fool I gave you all my love
I didn't know
You didn't care

It's not too late
To reconsider or change your mind
If you want to
Only you can end this hurt in my heart

It's in your eyes
The way you look at me
They say our love now
Was never meant to be

I just cried
You looked at me and laughed
Then I knew, I knew
You didn't care

I just cried
You turned and walked away
Then I knew, I knew
You didn't care

// Tears In Vain //

I don't want to love you
But I do
And I just can't help it

You bring me happiness
And then pain
Are these nights I spend
Crying over you really worth it
Really worth it
Or am I shedding tears in vain

You know every girl has to have
Someone she can depend on
Someone to trust in
And I depend on you day by day
It's always been that way

When you kiss me
Tears of joy I shed
Makes me wonder
Makes me wonder
Wonder am I shedding tears in vain

Darling I wonder
Are all these tears in vain

// Tumbling Tumbleweeds //

See them tumbling down 
Pledging their love to the ground
Lonely but free I'll be found
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

Cares of the past are behind
Nowhere to go but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I know when night has gone
That new world's born at dawn
I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart there's a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

I'll keep rolling along
Deep in my heart there's a song
Here on the range I belong
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

// Lazy Bones //

Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?
Never get your day's work done
I'm sleepin' in this noon day sun

Lazybones, lyin' in the shade
How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made?
Never get your cornmeal made
I'm sleepin' in this evening shade

When taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin'
The bugs fall off of the vine
And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin'
The the fish don't grab at your  line

Lazybones, loafin' all the day
How you gonna' make a dime that way
Never make a dime that way
Never hear a word I say

// You Need Me //

When day is done and you come home
You shouldn't spend your nights alone
That's when you need me baby

To always know that someone cares
And love like mine should be shared
We'll see you'll need me baby

We'll build up dreams and memories
And maybe raise a family
So give your love to one who yearns
I'll promise true love in return
How can you be so blind
Can't you see you need me

If you should disappoint me
And refuse my love
I know my heart would die
'Cause you are my reason for living
My heart and soul I'm giving
Darling hear my cry
You need me

To me my love's sacred thrill
It's all for you and you alone
You see you need me baby
Though you may find another who
Might take your love and be untrue
You see you need me baby

Have you experienced in the past
One sided love affairs don't last
No need to take a chance at all
When I'm just waiting for your call

How can you be so blind
Can't you see you need me
You need me, you need me

// Baby Doll //

Oh, baby doll, baby doll
He's my baby doll
He's good to me
So true to me
He's all right for me

You know I'm gonna love him forever
And give my life to him completely
I belong to my baby doll
He's my baby doll

He's so sweet
So handsome all the girls they envy me
Talking about my baby doll
When they see me holding his arm
Walking down the street

You should see me hold my head up high
It's a feeling I can't explain
Just proud to be walking with my baby doll

He's sugar to my taste
He's got sweet kisses
And a warm embrace
He's my baby doll, ooh baby doll

Please say he'll always be mine
From this day please tell me you'll love me
'Till the end of time

You know I'm gonna love him forever
And give my life to him completely
I belong to my baby doll

He's my baby doll, yeah
He's so right for me, yeah
The girls, they envy me, yeah
Ooh, baby doll

// Sunset //

Sunset, sunset
It's sunset, it's sunset

You went and left happy
You're all alone
You turned and walked away
About this time of day
It was always sunset

Sunset
I didn't want you to see me cry
So I turned my head
To hide the tears in my eyes
I turned when evening shadows fall
That's when I miss you most of all

And oh, it's sunset
Oh, sunset

// (The Man With The) Rock And Roll Banjo Band //

He's a groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

I got a sweet little guy
Who lives down the street
But nobody knows his name
Everybody was sad and feeling so bad
But that was before he came

Now everybody in the neighborhood
Seems to walk with a steady beat
By the rhythm of the guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

The way he plays that thing
It makes my poor heart ring
I'm gonna marry that guy someday

If you wanna know why I love him so
Then you ought to come and hear him play
From the dawn to the sunset
He keeps a-strumming on his banjo strings

He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

The way he plays that thing
It makes my poor heart ring
I'm gonna marry that guy someday

If you wanna know why I love him so
Then you ought to come and hear him play
From the dawn to the sunset
He keeps a-strumming on his banjo strings

He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He's the groovy swinging guy
With the rock and roll banjo band
He's the groovy swinging guy
