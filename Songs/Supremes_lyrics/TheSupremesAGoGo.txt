// Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart //

The love bug done bit me
Didn't mean for him to get me
Woo, get up in the morning
And I'm filled with desire
No, no, I can't stop the fire
Love is a real life wire
Ooh, it's a burning sensation
Far behind imagination

Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, ooh
Keeps me yearning

No, mama can't help me
No, daddy can't help me
I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out this situation

Now, when you're ill
You take a pill
When your thirsty
Drink your fill
What you gonna do
When love gets a hold
A hold on you
Love is like an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it

Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication
Love is a growing infection
And I don't know the correction
Got me rockin' and areelin'
And I can't shake the feelin'

Love is like an itching in my heart
Tearing it all apart
Just an itching in my heart
And baby, I can't scratch it
Keeps me sighing, ooh
Keeps me yearning

Keeps me burning
Keeps me tossing
Keeps me turning
Keeps me yearning

I've been bitten by the love bug
And I need some information
To help me out this situation
Love is a nagging irritation
Causing my heart complication

I've been bitten by the love bug...

// This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You) //

Ooo, this old heart of mine been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away I fear you're gone to stay
Lonely nights that come, memories that go
Bringin' you back again, hurtin' more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by 
You got me never knowin' if I'm comin' or goin'
But I, I love you, this old heart, darling, is weak for you
I love you, yes I do.

These old arms of mine miss havin' you around
Makes these tears inside start fallin' down
Always with half a kiss you remind me of what I miss
Though I try to control myself
Like a fool I start feelin' cause my head starts spinnin'.

Cause I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do.

Ooo, I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're here for a day, gone for the week now.

But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
I'll tell the world about it.

Cause I, I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, yes I do, yes I do
I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you
I love you, this old heart, darling, weak for you.

// You Can't Hurry Love //

I need love, love
To ease my mind
I need to find, find someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches
Must I stand before I find a love
To let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength, yeah
It's almost gone
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?

No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hangin' on
I remember mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

No, love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said:

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
[repeat and fade]

// Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over) //

All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking
Saying that out of my life into another's arms
You'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear 
But the words are loud and clear

Through these walls so thin
I hear my neighbors when they say
"He don't love her"
They say my heart's in danger
'Cause you're leaving me 
For the love of a stranger

Somebody shake me, wake me when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over

Boy, you're what my heart desires
My whole world you've inspired
I can't bear to be losing you
'Cause I've loved you my whole life through

Restlessly
I pace the floor
listening to my neighbors criticize
What a fool I am not to realize
You don't want me by your side
As the tears stream down my face
I can't believe I've been replaced
If I ever had a dream before
Somebody tell me I'm dreaming now

And then shake me, wake me 
Somebody when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreaming 
And wake me when it's over

// Baby I Need Your Loving //

Although you're never near
You're voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely
Yes, I'm lonely
Let my heart beats for you only

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a girl to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means having you to keep
'Cause lately I been losing sleep

Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

Empty nights echo your name
Sometimes I wonder will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah!
When you see me smile
You know things has gotten worse
Any smile you might see 
Has all been rehearsed

Darling, I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darling
Makes me feel half alive

"Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, I need your loving
Got to have all your loving

// These Boots Are Made For Walkin' //

You keep saying
You got something for me
something' you call love
But confess

You've been messin'
Where you shouldn't have been messin'
And now someone else
Is getting all your best

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep lying'
When you oughta be truthing
You keep losing
When you oughta not bet

You keep 'same-in'
When you oughta be changing
Now, what's right is right
But you ain't been right yet

My boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

You keep playing
When you shouldn't be playing
you keep thinking
You'll never get burned
I just found me
A brand new box of matches
And what he knows now
You ain't got time to learn

These boots are made for walking
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready boots?
Try to walk

// I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch) //

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers
Or wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to your, baby
And there's nothing I can do
Ooh, sugar

Sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see
Wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried 
But everytime I see your face
I get up all choked up inside

When I call your name, boy
It starts the flame burning in my heart
Tearin' it all apart 
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

Sugarpie honeybunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugarpie honeybunch
Do you anything you ask me to
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

Sugarpie honeybunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself

// Put Yourself In My Place //

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
Why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

Put yourself in my place

// Come And Get These Memories //

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read them any more

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear 
That you won from me at the state fair
Here's some old valentine cards
Give it to your new sweetheart

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Come and get'em, come and get'em

Here's our old favorite record
I can't stand to hear it anymore
Here's some old lingering love
It's in my heart and it's tearing it apart

Because of these memories
I never think of anybody but you
So, come on and get'em
'Cause I found somebody new
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
Come and get these memories
Since you've gone out of my life
