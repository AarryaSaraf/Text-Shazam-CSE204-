// Silver Bells //

Silver bells, silver bells
It's christmas time in the city
Ringeling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City side walks, busy side walks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas

Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Hear them ring
Ringeling
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ringeling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

// Born Of Mary //

The babe that was born of Mary
One cold and wintry night
He laid in the manger lonely
A star that shined so bright

NoÃ©l", NoÃ©l", how the angels sing
NoÃ©l", NoÃ©l", how did heavens ring
The babe that was born of Mary
One cold and wintry night

The shepherds abiding in the fields
Were watching over their sheep
And then in the town of Bethlehem
Mary sang her darling to sleep

The earth was filled with the precious love
Of the holy child sent from up above
The shepherds abiding in the fields
Were watching over their sheep.

And out of the East three wise men came
To see the promised king
The knelt down before this holy child
And then all three 

They praised this one who had come to earth
And the glories of this wond'rous birth
And out of the East three wise men came
To see the promised king.

Born of Mary.

// Children's Christmas Song //

Ding dong, ding dong, hear the bell
Ringing out the first Noel
Joyous chimes ring loud and clear
Spreading word the Saviour's here

Humble men kneel down to pray
On this very special day
Wise men bearing gifts of love

// My Christmas Tree //

There's a Christmas tree
In a window frame
Just inside my door
But my Christmas tree
Doesn't look the same
As it always has before

There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present
A girl ever had
Has gone away from me

Oh, my Christmas tree is not very big
In fact it's kind of small
Honey went, he picked 'em out
They always seem so tall

The lights don't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas bright
Is gone away from me

I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas is
My baby back at home

oh, my Christmas tree's so sad and bare
My room's so big and cold
They wish me happy new year
But the new year is already on

There's no little angel
On top where it used to be
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...
'Cause the angel
That made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me...

// Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer //

You know there's Dasher and Dancer
Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw him
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
"Hey, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history"

// Santa Claus Is Coming To Town //

Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you're asleep
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming
Santa Claus is coming to town

Look out, Santa's coming
Look out, Santa's coming
Santa Claus is coming to town

He knows when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out
You better not pout
You better not cry
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

// My Favorite Things //

Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crispapple strudel
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses and blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on your nose and eye lashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
Then I don't feel so bad

Girls in white dresses
Blue satin sashes
Snowflakes on my eye lashes
Ooh, my favorite things

// Little Bright Star //

Little bright star keep shining

When he was born long ago on Christmas night
Above his head a little star was shining bright
The wise men followed that light above.

Little bright star lead us today to his love
Little church bells keep ringing
Little church bells keep ringing.

Little church bells ringing out at Christmas time
Reminding us that the star of love still shines
Not just at Christmas but every day.

Little bright star, you're there to show us the way
Little bright star keep shining
Little bright star keep shining.

Oh little star shining over every land
Just keep on glowing so the world can understand
The joy of Christmas comes from within.

Little bright star, please keep on shining for all means
Keep on shining, keep on shining
Little bright star keep shining
Keep on shining, keep on shining.

// Joy To The World //

Joy to the world
The lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world
The savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
The wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders 
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders
Of his love
