// Stranger In Paradise //

Take my hand
I'm a stranger in Paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in Paradise

If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in Paradise
For mortals who stand beside
An angel like you

I saw your face
And I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rare

Somewhere in space
I hang suspended
Until I know
There's a chance that you care

Won't you answer that fervent prayer
Of a stranger in Paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

But open your angel arms
To a stranger in Paradise
And tell her that she need be
A stranger no more

// Yesterday //

Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly,
I'm not half the girl I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why he had to go
I don't know
He wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why he had to go
I don't know
He wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday,
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Mm mm mm mm

// I Hear A Symphony //

You've given me a true love
And every day I thank you, love
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting, so exciting

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly (I hear a symphony)
Ooh, your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine
Till I leave the past behind
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Play sweet and tenderly
Every time your lips meet mine, now, baby, baby, baby
You bring much joy within
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on, now, baby, baby, baby
Those tears that fill my eyes
I cry not for myself
But for those who've never felt the joy we felt (baby)

Whenever you're near, I hear a symphony
Each time you speak to me
I hear a tender rhapsody of love now, baby, baby
As you stand holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now, baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
Ooh, so close to me, baby, baby, baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody

// Unchained Melody //

Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

Time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
I need your love
God, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea

Lonely river sigh
Wait for me
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time

And time goes by
So slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine

I need your love
I need your love
God, speed your love to me

// With A Song In My Heart //

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace

When the music swells
I'm touching your hand
It tells that me you're standing near

And at the sound of your voice
Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?

But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you

// Without A Song //

Without a song
The day would never end
Without a song
The road would never have been
When things go wrong
A man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn
Would never ever see a plow
That field of corn
Would be deserted now
A man is born
But he's no good no how
Without a song

I've got my trouble and woe
But sure as I know
The Jordan will roll
I'll get along
As long as a song
Is strung in my soul

I'll never know
What makes the rain to fall
I'll never know
What makes the grass so tall
I only know
There ain't no love at all 
Without a song

// My World Is Empty Without You //

My world is empty without you, baby
My world is empty without you, baby

And as I go my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strenght
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear
I miss so much

My world is empty without you, baby
My world is empty without you, baby

From this old world
I try to hide my face
From this loneliness
There's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories
I know so well

I need love know
More then before
I can hardly 
Carry on anymore

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is empty) without you, babe

My mind and soul 
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist
And each time that darkness falls
It finds me alone
With these four walls

My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is empty) without you, babe

Without you, babe
Without you, babe

// A Lover's Concerto //

How gentle is the rain
That falls softly on the meadow
Birds high up in the trees
Serenade the flowers with their melodies

Oh, see there beyond the hill
The bright colours of the rainbow
Some magic from above
Made this day for us just to fall in love

Now I belong to you
From this day until forever
Just love me tenderly
And I'll give to you every part of me

Oh, don't ever make me cry
Through long lonely nights without love
Be always true to me
Keep this day in your heart eternally

Someday we shall return
To this place upon the meadow
We'll walk out in the rain
Hear the birds above singing once again

You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

Just hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

You'll hold me in your arms
And say once again you love me
And if your love is true
Everything will be just as wonderful

// Any Girl In Love (Knows What I'm Going Through) //

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
I've got an aching heart
Makes me cry sometimes
I've got an aching heart
Makes me cry sometimes

For every aching heart
Some tears must fall
'Cause when you lose the one you love
You lose your all and all

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through

The way I miss your loving
Makes me cry sometimes
The way I miss your loving
Makes me cry sometimes

I gave you my love
In you I had no doubts
But as soon as love walked in
You walked right out

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through

The way you hesitate to kiss me
Makes me cry sometimes
The way you never seem to miss me
Makes me cry sometimes
But I never bother
To wipe the tears from my face
'Cause I know another tear
Will fall in it's place

Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through
Any girl in love, ooh!
Yeah, knows what I'm going through

// Wonderful! Wonderful! //

Sometimes we walk hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare

Then your lips cling to mine
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and stars
I turn to you and melt in your arms
There we are, darling, only you and I

What a moment to share
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is filled with wond'rous things, it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your unspoken love
I'm aware of the treasure that I own

And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love
And I say to myself
It's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

// Everything Is Good About You //

So sweet you are
Like a shining star
You brighten my whole world
It brings me joy being your girl

'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't live without you
You're so sweet, you're so fine
I'm so thankful that you're mine

Full of clover
Bustin' out all over
You're the summer in the park
You're the candle in the dark
And I love you, so true
Yes, I do

You're the love of my life
You're a pure delight
The short time I've been with you
You must've come from heaven above
You're the poets meaning of love

You're tender touch means oh so much
You're the sunshine after the storm
When I'm cold you make me warm
And I love you, so true
Yes, I do

It's a lonely day and night
And things will be alright
Together just you and me
Just living in pure ecstacy

'Cause everything's good about you
I couldn't live without you
You are my guiding light
When things go wrong
You make them right
This heart inside's bursting with pride
Please let your heart surround me
And always stay around me
I love you, so true
Yes, I do, yeah

// He's All I Got //

You're a girl that hates to see others happy
Unless you're happy too
So you've told the boy I love
A lot of things that ain't true

And its' wringing my heart
Cos it's making us drift apart
So humbly I ask of you
To undo the wrong that you've done

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day I found him

Girl your selfishness causes unhappiness
But why make it hard for me?
Since you been unhappy in love
I guess misery loves company

For once in your life
Consider another's feelings
Confess the truth
That you've been concealing

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day found him

I would gladly go to him
Instead of asking you
But there might be a shadow of a doubt
Your gossip might have been true

So tearfully I ask of you
Please undo the wrong that you've done
Cos without his love
I know, I know I can't go on

Please go to him, tell him
Before he finds someone new
Cos if I ever lose him
I don't know what I'll do

Cos he's all I got
Built my world around him
Since the day found him
Can't bear to lose him
