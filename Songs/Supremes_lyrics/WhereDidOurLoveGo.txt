Album: WhereDidOurLoveGo

// Where Did Our Love Go //

Baby, baby
Baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

You came into my heart
So tenderly
With a burning love
That stings like a bee

Now that I surrender
So helplessly
You now wanna leave
Ooh, you wanna leave me

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?
Ooh, don't you want me
Don't you want me no more
Ooh, baby

Baby, baby
Where did our love go
And all your promisses
Of a love forever more

I've got this burning, burning
Yearning feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me
And it hurts so bad

Before you won my heart
You were a perfect guy
But now that you got me
You wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby) ooh baby

Baby, baby don't leave me
Ooh, please don't leave me
All by myself

Ooh, baby, baby
Where did our love go?

// Run, Run, Run //

Girls, gather 'round me
And hear the news
He finally kissed me
Oh, happy days
My heart's gotta shout it
I'll get my diary
And write about it

Well as your friends
We want to say
He'll break your heart one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, but he's such a quiet kind of guy
How he thrills me, my oh my
Maybe it isn't true
What they say about him

Don't be fooled
By the shyness in his eyes
Don't you know
He's just a devil in disguise
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Well as your friends
We want to say
He'll make a fool of you one day
So you better run run run run run run
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

No no no
But how can I run away
When I love him more each day
So with him I'm gonna stay
I'll take my chances along the way

He won my heart from the start
From him I will never never part
I love him so, love him so
Never let him go
Every time he gets nearer
My love gets dearer, so much dearer
Oh no no no

// Baby Love //

Ooh baby love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me, what did I do wrong
To make you stay away so long

'Cause baby love, my baby love
Been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's do some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms, why don't you stay?

Need ya, need ya
Baby love, ooh, baby love

Baby love, my baby love
Why must we seperate, my love
All of my whole life through
I never loved no one but you
Why you do me like you do?
I get this need

Ooh, ooh, need to hold you
Once again, my love
Feel your warm embrace, my love
Don't throw our love away
Please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be
Loneliness has got the best of me

My love, my baby love
I need you, oh how I need you
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you

Baby, baby, ooh till it's hurtin' me
Till it's hurtin' me
Ooh, baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away

// When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes //

He gave me the eye
But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didn't seem to mind

I told him be on his way
But not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face

// Come See About Me //

I've been crying (ooh, ooh)
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned (to tears)
But tears won't wash away the fears

That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns
It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you

So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone and you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back and be mine

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you

So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)

Sometime's up (ooh, ooh)
Sometime's down (ooh, ooh)
My life's so uncertain (ooh, ooh)
With you not around (ooh, ooh)

From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep
Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you

So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby
(Come see about me)

You know I'm so lonely
(Come see about me)
I love you only
(Come see about me)

See about your baby
(Come see about me)
Hurry, hurry
(Come see about me)

// Long Gone Lover //

Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone

Let me tell you that he's far far away
But I think about him every day
In my dreams at night I see his face
Ain't no other guy gonna take his place
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better

He's been gone for such a long long time
But you know I'm sure that he's still mine
Though the things people say are hurting me
They're tryin' to make me think
He's deserting me
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better

Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone

Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone

I got a letter from him just this afternoon
Telling me that he'll be coming soon
Whenever I'm down and feeling bad
Whenever my heart is feeling sad
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better

Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover

// I'm Giving You Your Freedom //

You're doing me wrong
Leading me on
I can see there's no need for me
So I'm gonna have to set you free

I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

Every time I wanted you around
You were nowhere to be found
The price I pay to love you
Is too much to bear
And it's unfair when you don't really care

I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

I tried so hard to make you happy with me
But now I see our love could never be
I can't deny I'm still in love with you
But this is it, I'm callin' it quits

I'm giving you your freedom
To find somebody new
There's no sense in both of us
Making each other blue

There's no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue
There's no sense in the both of us
Making each other blue

// A Breathtaking Guy //

One night you held me tight
And whispered in my ear
All night sweet words
I never heard
And I believed every word

Next day you came my way
Without a word to say you passed me by
You didn't bat an eye
My darling won't you tell me why
You're acting strange toward me
Why have you changed toward me

Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy

That night your love was true
The next day we were through
Your love was gone
And you were moving on
And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you
Was it just fun to you

Are you just a breathtaking
First sight soul-shaking
One night love-making
Next day heartbreaking guy

Breathtaking, soulshaking,
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy
Breathtaking, soulshaking,
Lovemaking, heartbreaking guy

// He Means The World To Me //

If he'd just take one look at me
Or maybe touch my hand
I'd bow down and tell him
His every wish is my command

My nights are so lonely
I'm thinking of him only
Oh how can I make him see
He means the world to me

My friends all tell me that I'm silly
That my love for him he'll never see
But I, I can't help it
He means the world to me

He means the world to me
World to me
My friends say I'm silly, silly, silly
But I really care
I'm here to tell you
That he means the world
I really care

// Standing At The Crossroads Of Love //

I'm standing at the crossroads of love
I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way to go
Don't know which way to turn
Though the love I give is not returned
For that boy
My heart still yearns

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
'Cause when I'm with him he mistreats me
Runs around and cause me misery
But I love him
I can't deny
And without him
I'd surely die
It hurts to be with him 
And it hurts to be without him

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way
Don't know which way to go
Don't know which way
Don't know which way to turn

There's always tears on my pillow
'Cause I'm always in the middle
Of heartache and emotion
Heartbreak and devotion
Loving, caring, when it's despairing
Trying to be true
Though it makes me blue

So I'm standing at the crossroads of love
Just standing at the crossroads of love
Don't know which way to turn
Don't know which way to turn
I'm standing at the crossroads

// Your Kiss Of Fire //

When you first gave it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
The burning flame of love
Started mounting higher
Till it consumed my heart and soul
And like King Midas loved his gold
I wanted you alone to hold
And your kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire

And then you took it away
Your sweet kiss of fire
Taking the thrill out of love
Killing my desire
I'm like a leaf without a tree
Like a fish without the sea
I'm as cold as cold can be
Without your kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire

Please don't forsake me
After showing me the way to love
Just come on and make me
Warm as the sun that shines above

Bring it, bring it to me
Your sweet kiss of fire
Stop this hurt within me
Bring back my desire
It's you that I adore
I'll do anything you implore
If you'll just give to me once more
Your sweet kiss of fire
Your sweet kiss of fire
Fire, fire
