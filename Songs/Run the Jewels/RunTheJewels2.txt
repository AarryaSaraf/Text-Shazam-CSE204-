Album: RunTheJewels2

// Jeopardy //

[Killer Mike:]
I'm finna bang this bitch the fuck out!
You betta' -- You might wanna record the way you feelin' like history bein' made
This muthafucka put a mirror on the goddamn screen
Let's go, El-P!
Huh? Champ! That's what we're gonna do, Mick

[Killer Mike:]
I'm up at midnight, I'm dippin' off in my Nizzikes
A gun and a metal pizzipe, a knizzife is to my rizzight
I'm lurkin' servin' on pussies who lack a purpose
I've got 'em filled up with frizzight like Mizzike is you all rizzight?
I'm lookin' lurkin' on bitches twerkin' for service
The bitch's bag is a Birkin, I'm yellin' screamin' and cursin'
I'm putting pistols in faces at random places like
Bitch give it up or stand adjacent to Satan
Bad man chillin', the villains is here
No Jesuses here, I hear the demons in my ear
And I want it, I need it, see it, I take it
Never fake it, wrap you motherfuckers up, leave you naked
The jewels runners, top tag team for two summers
Live and let live, fuck you cuz, cause that's a fool's honor
I'm walkin' totin' on two llamas
You niggas ass and trash and trash, fuck it, I'm too honest
So fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely
And that's about the psyche of Jaime and Mikey
You meet another pair better, highly unlikely
And if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me
I live for the thrill of the kill, yes it excites me
You know your favorite rapper ain't shit and me, I might be
The closest representation of God you might see
Pay honors like your momma young sonna and take a right knee
The passion of Pac, the depth of Nas, circa nine three
Mix the mind of Brad Jordan and Chuck D and find me
I spit with the diction of Malcolm or say a Bun B
Prevail through Hell, so Satan get thee behind me

(Run the Jewels)

[El-P:]
I've never been much of shit, by most measurements don't exist
On the radar a little blip in the shadow of motherships
Been smothered and brashly muffled by hucksters of global spin
Like the sign on my back says "stab me", my soul is your little bitch
But maybe you should be careful when flipping a stranger's switch
Like assuming the war is won ain't a symptom of arrogance
When nothing to lose a step up then everything's for the win
So we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dicks
I live to spit on your grave, my existence is to disgrace you
The kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food
That's why we got the people behind us
While other rappers are vaginas for the fame the jewels runners will always stay rude
Motherfuck your permission, was never yours to begin with
And every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fucking prison
I been here making raw shit and never asked to be lauded
Run the Jewels is the answer, your question is "what's poppin'?"

// Oh My Darling Don't Cry //

Oh my
Oh my

[El-P:]
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp
(You are now listening to Run the Jewels 2)
Fuck the law, they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp
I don't fuck with or talk like all these fuckin' imps
Style violent, give a fuck if you deny it, kids
You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G
I dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up and it don't exist,
Soak it in and need no assist
You can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit
Trust me, I'm a doctor DOOM
Oper-rate of my pulse won't raise a bit

[Killer Mike:]
Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina
Ski mask in a Pontiac Catalina
It's obese female opera singer
You can run the jewels or lose your fingers
Me and El-P got time to kill
Got folks to kill on overkill
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel
There's one black, one white, we shoot to kill
That fuckboy life about to be repealed
That fuckboy shit about to be repelled
Fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels
Allahu Akbar, BOOM from Mike and El

[El-P:]
Life is hell, death's a bitch
And these FUBAR rulers getting rich
I cop a zip, it opens up
I smoke it up, go home and fuck
C'est la vie girl, when in Rome
I gave the face, please pay with dome
My business card says you're in luck
I do two things, I rap and fuck

[Killer Mike:]
I fuckin' rap
I tote the strap
I smoke the kush
I beat the puss
I read the books, did the math
Don't need a preacher preachin' on my behalf
No teacher can't teach my arrogant ass
I'm blowin' on crippy while readin' the scriptures as written by Egyptians while sippin' on whiskey
Aye baby you with me?

Oh my
Don't cry [x4]

[El-P:]
[Whip Crack]
We run this spot like a Chinese sweatshop
Don't stop
Work a worker 'til chest pop
Cardiac arrested, I'm so invested
I'm self-invented
That's no illusion
There's no confusion
You see the future. You fear the future
I've seen the truth and I'm so deluded
I been a better bad guy than I been better than bad
Been a better bully, talk beatin' on my chest
In fact I'm half stack from a rack
I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts
Maniac, brainiac, run go tell them that
ATLien, NY felon rap

[Killer Mike:]
Handle me wrong I'm snappin'
Show up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully with a fully automatic
Heart full of pain and a head full of havoc
Everybody stepped on the kid I'm letting them have it (have it)
Leaving they momma to say "what happened?"
Who gonna buy my baby a casket?
Fuck that bitch I'm a bastard

[El-P:]
Megablast, I'm mega lit
On Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid
You got the cash, I'll make the trip
I make the trip, you better pay
Done worse for less, don't make my day
I'm not from Earth, from far away
I bust through chests like baby greys

[Killer Mike:]
Runnin' the jewels of the game
Whippin' the mixes like chickens of 'caine
Spittin' the sickness again
Parents is livid again
Kids is just fuckin' insane
Pointin' that pistol and fist for the chain
Reppin the symbol like they in a gang
Delivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend

Oh my
Don't cry [x2]

// Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1 //

[Killer Mike:]
Bunches and bunches, punches is thrown until you're frontless
Oodles and oodles, bang bullets at suckas' noodles
Last album voodoo, proved that we was fuckin' brutal
I'm talking crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic boo boo
I'm Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money buku
My beats is bangin', fuck what you rappin', who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you

[El-P:]
You itsy bitsy furry fright and frickin' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for Winter swimming
Look at these kitties, Mike, I'mma rat-a-tat 'em for living
I deal in dirty work, do the deed and then dash, ditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but they stuck in a fist and gun position
We run our brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It's all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear in the smoke like we're fuckin' magicians

[Killer Mike & El-P:]
No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the morning, my fist to your face is fucking Folgers
We might be giants, standing on little dandy shoulders
You punks is pussy proverbial pansy panty holders
I Jake the Snake 'em, DDT 'em in mausoleums
Macabre massacres killing cunts in my colosseum
They all actors, giving top in back of a BM
I'd fall back if the casting calls are ending in semen

[El-P:]
I'm the foulest, no need for any evaluations
I'm a phallus for Johnson and Jimmy spraying faces
Any cow that is sacred will get deface'd
Like any tyrant murderer gets replaced, face it
The fellows at the top are likely rapists
But you like "Mellow out man, just relax, it's really not that complicated"
Well pardon me, I guess I'm just as sane as you explain'ed
Or maybe sanctifying the sadistic is derange'd

[Killer Mike:]
This Run The Jewels is, murder, mayhem, melodic music
Psychotics use it then lose it, junkies simply abuse it
That's word to Phillip Seymour Hoffman, I'm pushin coffin
I probably smell like a pound when they put me in a coffin
The gates of hell are pugnaciously pacin', waitin'
I give a fuck if I'm late, tell Satan be patient
But I ain't here for durations, I'm just taking vacations
And tell 'em fuck 'em, I never loved 'em and salutations

// Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck) //

[Zack De La Rocha:]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, run them, fuck the slow mo

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like The Anarchist Cookbook
(Look good, posing in a centerfold of Crook Book)
Black on black on black with a ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin', bruh? Ain't nobody stylin', bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my cripples and my bloodles and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?
Or take over a jail, give those COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, God damn I love the smell
Like it's a pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' 'em for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

[El-P (Killer Mike):]
We out of order, your honor, you're out of order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a flip wig synonym, livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I fuck for the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch
Look at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons
(Aye, we the type to beat the preacher with a grin and a gun)

[Hook - Zack De La Rocha:]
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them
Run them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast
Run them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them

[El-P (Killer Mike):]
A wise man once said, ("We all dead, fuck it")
Just spit it disgusting youngin', and hold your nuts while you're gunnin'
I listened, tatted a sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'
Waitin' for their christenin', I know the neighbors can't help but listen in
A dirty boy who come down on a side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only silence I have is an act of conjugal visitin'

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Go mane and missin' my misses, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is givin' vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers, enslavers of men and women
Includin' members of clergy that rule on you through religion
(So strippin' kids to the nude and then tell 'em God'll forgive 'em)

[Hook]

[Zack De La Rocha:]
It's De La on the cut, liftin' 6 on your stitchy crew
I'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew
My battle status is burnin' mansions from Dallas to Malibu
Check my résumé, your residence is residue
Call her a skin job and my honey dip'll backflip for you
You playin', God your eye sockets, she gon' rip in two
We sick of bleedin' out a trace, spray a victim, you
Done dyin', Phillip AK Dickin' you
With clips in the bottom, we dippin' from Gotham
Yes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin
I'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony
Ripped like Rakim Allah, feds is checkin' my melody
Yes aggressively tested we'll bump stretchers and penalties
Dump cases with face and the cop pleas when we seizing a pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons
Still pilin' fast, plus Afghani toe taggin'
Now they trackin' me and we bustin' back, see
The only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories

[Hook]

// All My Life //

[Killer Mike:]
(Paul is dead)
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for...One time for...
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for the...One, one-one-one

[Killer Mike:]
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
It's the young black leader to the people, man
If you're girl's fine, nigga might eat her, man
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man
And oh Lord this reefer so potent
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open
One half the best tag team ever
Them other fellas all right we better
Anybody disagree they jealous
And anybody don't just motherfucking yellow (just yellow)
Fuck a boss I'm the goddamn owner
And I smell like YSL and marijuana
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper
Secretary told me fuck you. I told her you gonna

[Hook:]
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch
(All my life)
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch

[EL-P:]
Sharp like knife
I bet a buck I'm stuck in the guts of the night
And I'm (ready on the right)
Please pass that already, alright
Get fetti, he's steady on the mic what the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike
Never step light, no fair fights
We got the drugs y'all wanted
Take a suck on the tail of a comet
I'm so high you a hobbit
Dick level, please back up off it
Better off dead like Paul is
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest

[Hook x2]

Go! [x32]

// Lie, Cheat, Steal //

[El-P:]
Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I'll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who'll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch, whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you defacto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like "fuck is you?"
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nathan sacred I'll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

[Hook - Killer Mike:]
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win
(Everybody doin' it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win
Everybody doin' it
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win
(Everybody doin' it)
Lie, cheat, steal, kill, win

[Killer Mike:]
I'm fly as a pegasus, that's no embellishment
I'm here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I'm a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you've been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this, run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the "you can't come" list?
Now don't be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I'm like who cares
What I wouldn't be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don's at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who's that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?
Gone

[Hook]

Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it
Everybody doin' it

// Early //

[Killer Mike:]
It be feelin' like the life that I'm livin' a man I don't control
Like every day I'm in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine's the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask "why you're here?" I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that's what it is
He chimed "you got a dime?
I said "Man, I'm tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don't lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife, man, I ain't got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
Cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son"
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said "shut up"
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk and hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I'd be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

[Hook - Boots:]
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early [x4]

[El-P:]
It be feelin' like the life that I'm living man, I don't control
Cause every day I'm in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o's, so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don't pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y'all
That the true truth's truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth's truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o'clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They'll watch you walk to the store they're recording
But didn't record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched, cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again, early

[Hook]

// All Due Respect //

[Killer Mike:]
This year we iller than a nun in a cumshot
Getting' double penetrated in a dope spot
By two hard pipe hittin' Niggas
On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2pac
I'll beat you to a pulp no fiction
Tarantino flow new Jules and Vincent
Blow marijuana smoke no incense
Exhale in the face of innocent infants
On some "Ah hah look what I did" shit
And if I get stopped by a crooked ass cop I'm a put a bullet in a pig
And Rin Tin Tin, ah hah hah look what I did again
We the hooligans outside of school again
Sayin don't be a fool never follow rules again
We the bad boys bully with the fully that
The teachers say ain't shit and in the need of discipline
We the goddamn reason for ritalin
In the back of the class, twitchin' and fidgetin'
Dead wrong we never got along
We laughed at the kids that was active participants
Bad boy walk right past church with the work in a bag and a bible of Gideon
Got suspended for bullyin' a bully
When I go back to class I'ma punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again
Punch him in his shit again

[Hook:]
Cause you get no respect

[El-P:]
I don't flirt with greatness I wifed it in Vegas
The shits all paid for I signed the papers
Used to date but then I made her my main bitch
Bought us a place on a lake with some acreage
And Mike's my neighbor straight from Greatville
Any invader get slayed and stay killed
On sovereign land, Mike fill the safe up
We call when the fam get paid a great thrill
Bad News Bear hug beats then creep off
You drive a rape van
Mullet Ray-Bans
We do Vicious
You do witness
You don't clap shit
You's a cricket
Run the J's we don't run so much it's all fun and games till my J's get scuffed
I'm livid, fuming, out of touch
I wear sweatpants to funerals, guns to lunch
Close the blinds they got drones and mines we so close to the lie I could almost die
I got no goals left but to save my mind
They got more holes dug In the earth, oh my
The beat get abused like I rock a wife beater
Drinker, fired by the company
Friday, late on the car note tryna do taxes
This my house it's high or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway
High or the highway

[Hook]

[El-P:]
I'm a thrill killer, I will test you
Just like daddy fuckin' left you
It's all your fault mommy's lonely
You're a burden, she needs rescue

[Killer Mike:]
Hey little buddy, where's your mommy?
Call me stepdad or Uncle Johnny
Here's a dollar don't follow behind me
I gotta go bang out mom and auntie

[El-P:]
I hunt lions, tigers, rare vaginas
Hang where the cops seem scared to find us
Pop stars peep the bars and rewind us
Fuck your life but first run the diamonds
From the jungle (the jungle) the brothers (the brothers)
Can't relate to your first world struggles
You want safety, hugs and cuddles
IED's will leave bloody puddles

[Killer Mike:]
Woke up in Nigeria
Kicked out America
Case of malaria
Shit got scarier
Got left with a gun and a pitbull terrier
And a note from my dad said I hope God carry ya
Fought one or two wars while I made It to the shores
Y'know back to the home of a rock in Georgia
To return as a king, Michael the benevolent
Gold draped ridin' on the neck of an elephant

[Hook]

// Love Again (Akinyele Back) //

[Killer Mike:]
Reminiscinin
On our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy
Ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette
Fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husbaland
Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'
Do you ask him pretty please
Do you crawl on hands and knees
Like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl
The world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else
I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this
Pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin'
I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again
Feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance
2 Live Crew the narrative
There it is

[Hook:]
I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I get with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

[El-P:]
Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shirt off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now your with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
Still got my

[Hook]

[Gangsta Boo:]
That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swole
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape
That nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
He say love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke-ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' do'
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

[Gangsta Boo:]
He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)

// Crown //

[Killer Mike:]
Down with the shame
Down with the shame
Used to walk traps in the rain with cocaine
Used to write raps in the traps as I sat in the rain and I prayed that God give me a lane
Give me a lane
Give me the fame
Give me the fame and I promise to change
Won't be the same
Won't be the same type of man that puts cocaine in this lady's hand
Heard she was pregnant, I'm guilty I reckon cause I hear that good shit can hurt baby's brain
Heard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talkin'
Since then, ain't nothin been the same
Seen her some years later out in decatur told her that I'm sorry for causin' her pain
Causin' me pain?
Causin' me pain?
She asked again and she grabbed my right hand
Asked am I crazy, said look here, baby, I release you from all of your sins and your shame
Cause I've been redeemed
I found in Christ
Whatever it take I hope you find it, Mike
The look on her face shown that glory replaced all the shame and the hate and that she wears a crown
My late grandma Bettie had prayed with her heavy and told her to tell me lay my burdens down

[Hook:]
Can't pick up no crown, holding
What's holding you down
Can't pick up no crown, holding
What's holding you down
Can't pick up no crown, can't pick up no crown

[El-P:]
(Down with the shame
Down with the shame)
Carried the flag in some other men's name
Loaded my weapon and swore to them vengeance and stepped with aggression right into the fray
Into the haze
Into the murk
Told me to prove to them what I was worth
We'll teach you to move without mercy and give you the tools to go after the causers of hurt
You'll become death
You will take breath
This is for everything you've ever loved
Use all the pain that you've felt in your life as the currency go out and trade it for blood
You are not you
You are now us
We are the only ones that you can trust
You'll become fear
They'll become dust
Before this moment you didn't mean much
You are the smoldering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us
Give us your empathy we'll give you lust
Let yourself go my son time to grow up
Give up your childish obsession with questioning
Anything we don't tell you is irrelevant
Everything you've ever been is replaced by the metal and fire of the weapon you clutch

A little toast for the no ones
With a nod to the masters
To the ones with the riches
From the ones who the rags fit
A little smoke for the gone boys
A little nod to the spirits
We're still here runnin' round screaming
They're still here pointing and laughin'
Don't walk away when I talk
I'm tellin' you
Turn around mister
I got a permanent bop
Who the hell do I think I am not
And I'm twice as hot
As about half of hell
I get lighthouse lit up
Get down diduck
The boy got a barracuda bite
You can tell

[Killer Mike:]
Got hope for the living
Got prayers for the dead
In the sky got whiskey and rye for the voices in my head
Got kush for the pain
Cause the world is dangerous
Driven great men insane
Anchor themselves with angel dust
Somewhere between love and lust
A nut get bust
And a baby get made
It seems that trouble trouble us and follow us
Like all our days
In every holy book it says we suffer that's what it is
So riddle me this from the womb to the tomb why do
We fight to live

You say you wanna be my leader
I think you wanna be my God
You say you on the side of the righteous
I say I'm gonna hang with the wrong
There's truth where the filth is
There's lies in the law
You want a whore with a white dress
I want a wife in a thong
You love fear and division
I ain't fuck with your symbolism
I don't give a fuck about power
I'll pluck an eye out a pyramid
Cut a ear from a mouse hat
Go Van Gough on a house rat
Find another mind to devour
Motherfucker I'm really not hearin' it

[Killer Mike:]
A pope is a fraud
A church is a lie
A queen is the same damn thing
You should pray to your fake god that she die
God really exists I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody tell you different, just selling you religion, tryin' to keep your ass in line
I kill my masters
I mentor none
That means when I die that's it
My style is gone I'm a one of one
One half of the great RTJ
Defeated the odds went to war with the gods
Earned all our scars and came back straight

// Blockbuster Night, Pt. 2 //

[Killer Mike:]
The elephant's in the room, I'm talking two ton(as)
Bitter truth to ya' face, like this is two gun(as)
One half of the crew, you know them jewel runners
Move us out of our lane, shit who's gonna?
Shit stain on they brain, that's right- poo'd on 'em
And pissed on 'em! Dirt kicked on 'em!
Shot his cat, pop that pussy, threw that bitch!
Stood behind his mama, put my dick on her!
Killer did a Killa Cam- couldn't kill a kid so I spit on her! (Puuuuh!) Like this on her!

[El-P:]
I somersault in the room and then pop to the van damme split on em
Rappers all get the dick like they got clits on em
Big and sweaty testicular cancer induced tits on em
The love to hug and cry and explain what they are the victim of
Braid each others hair and tell stories bout how they've been in love
Hey kids I'm a computer, I'm a trooper feeling super, shoot the future like a looper
You tryna step like gooses ima go home with your luger
The tie-ers of the nooses get a broom up in their pooper

[Killer Mike:]
This is for the dope do-er, ho pursuer
If you procure then you cut her and stick her like a skewer
See this is for paupers and the prisoner, authors of the literature
Opposers to the holders of the swastika insignia

[Despot:]
Cue the music I'm bout to do something stupid
I got a new shiny tool kit to fix your face and I'll use it
Flippin birds I ain't talkin no middle fingers
Come line up to kiss the ring of your favorite rap singer
Des pot roast comin out the oven hot
Stuntin on you bumbaclots fronting like you runnin blocks
Bet your mother love to watch you come up out ya fuckin socks
Spin the barrel take a shot loves you or it loves you not
Pop..schlepping weapons out the seven
Betting on who gettin to heaven first with the henchmen
Try to test me I'll send some shots at your keppy
You best address me correctly but mama still calls me letchky

[Wiki:]
When someone ask me to spit it, I'm nasty
Like a cabbie with cricket, I know it like the back of my hand
I actually did it If you even think 'bout dapping my hand
Homie better be dapper than Dan, You wit it
Actually fam, what you wanna gonna laugh at me fam?
Right cause I'm tacky and tan
It's actually him pass me the gin
Pass me whatever you got, pass me your bitch
Pass me the clip hit it hold it now it's bout time to pass me the 5th Sipit
Soledmysoulforitpass it back to the bitch
Hopefully she get half as just swizzed as wik
After the fact that he had to just sip, just dip
