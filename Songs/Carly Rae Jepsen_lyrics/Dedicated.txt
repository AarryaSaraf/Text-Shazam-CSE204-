Album: Dedicated

// Julien //

Woke up this morning
It feels like everyday
I got the blues babe
Not going away
Another bad dream
Where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time

We had our moment
We had our summertime
Asked me to leave with you
But I could never decide
I've been so torn up
I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home, coming home?
'Cause I've been living for that day

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe

I tried another
To keep me satisfied
But all your colors are
Still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers, ah
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home, coming home?
'Cause I've been living for that day

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe

(...through the last breath that I breathe
Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe)

Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering Julien
Through the last breath that I breathe
(Julien)

(Ah yeah, all night yeah, Julien, Julien
Julien, Juli-, Julien)

// No Drug Like Me //

Take me to the limit, hold me down there
You say you love me but you wouldn't dare-are
You're tryna make it easy, you know that I care
You say you love me but you wouldn't dare-are

Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Your head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me

I can see you spinning around in your head
(There's a little ghost of us)
A little history of us in there-ere
(Oh)
And now we've finally got to the safe other side
(Something's coming over us)
Why would we risk it for another try?
(Another try, come alive)

Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Your head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me

(You ain't tried no drug like me)
Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down

And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
(All for you)
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
(All for you)
When your mouth is running dry
Your head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
(All for you)
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
(All for you)
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me

// Now That I Found You //

Waking up next to you every morning
How did we get this far? It came without a warning
And in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
You and me get too real but all I feel is alright

My heart's a secret, mmm, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you

Don't give it up, don't say it hurts
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

Give me the words I want, baby, just say it
You know me way too well to keep it complicated
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)
But I can't deny the moment when I taste it

My heart's a secret, mmm, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, mmm, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you

Don't give it up (Don't give it up)
Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all (I want it all)
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

Thought it was impossible
It's just like a miracle
Say nothing's impossible now
Now that I found, now that I found you
Now that I found, now that I found you

Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
I want it all (I want it all)
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you (Oh)
Now that I found you
Now that I found you (Oh)
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

// Want You In My Room //

When all the lights out (Hey), where you're going?
I keep a window, for you, it's always open
I'm like a lighthouse, I'm a reminder of where you're going
I'm in your head now, from every second now
Is your love growing?

Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?

Oh, with you (Hey), a girl could get bolder
I just wanna get a little bit closer (Ha-ah-ah)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no (Hey), the night's not over
I just wanna get a little bit closer (A little bit closer)
And I'll press you to the pages of my heart (Hey)

(I want you in my room)
On the bed, on the floor
(I want you in my room)
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby, don't you want me, too?

Baby, don't you want me, too?
On the bed, on the floor
Slide on through my window
Baby, don't you want me, too?

// Everything He Needs //

He's strong, not one to settle down
You know he's that guy
Electric, those lips can wear me out
Wild thing he's all mine

It's crazy, but when he can't sleep, I understand
Like pressure points, my love can ease him in my hand
'Cause (He needs me)

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)
(He needs me)
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)

Soft rain (Soft rain), we roll the windows down
Sweat disco all night
It's clear (It's clear), we'd like to fool around
His hands reach for mine

I know it's tough, baby, keep both eyes on the road
Pull right, a burnt-out streetlight, only halfway home
(He needs me)

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)
(He needs me)
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)

Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)
Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)

You know, not just physically
Emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, sexually
All the ways

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)
(He needs me)
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
(He needs me)
(I got everything he needs)

Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)
Could never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
Enough of my
I could never give him enough
Enough of my love (He needs me)

// Happy Not Knowing //

I fight, I fight
All my feelings for you all night, all night
Don't stare, don't stare
I've got feelings for you I hide, I hide

But I'll only go so far
I don't have the energy
To risk a broken heart
When you're already killing me

But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

All our friends that I know
They've been trying to set us up together (Up together)
I lie, I lie
I say somebody else would suit you better (Suit you better)

But I'll only go so far
I don't have the energy
To risk a broken heart
When you're already killing me

But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

I turn your love away 'cause I want to sleep at night
It's just like my broken heart is my alibi
I'm afraid, afraid, afraid, afraid of knowing
What I'm knowing, what I'm knowing
I'm happy not knowing

But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing

Where this goes
How this goes (Happy not)
If this goes (I'm happy not)
Well, I'm happy not knowing
Where this goes
How this goes (Happy not)
If this goes (I'm happy not)
Well, I'm happy not knowing

// I'll Be Your Girl //

Now you're in love, I can see you sold out
Where was I, pic-picture, cut my eyes out
"He's so hypnotising," said every girl you ever met
When I lose, when I lose, I hold out

You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

Turn me on, I'm jealous of that night watch
I'm the voyeur searching through my laptop
It's so truth defying, everything you ever said
Right or wrong, right or wrong
I won't stop

You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

(Ah, ah, ah)
I'll be your girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
I'll be your girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
I'll be your girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

Standing at your door, calling out your name
Find me in the dark, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest
Banging on your door, calling out your name
Find me in your heart, find me here again
I got nothing left, make a little protest

You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl

(Ah, ah, ah)
All I mean is I'm going out of breath
(Ah, ah, ah)
For the way that I feel when you hold me like that
(Ah, ah, ah)
All I pray is I'm getting over it
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah) I'd trade places today if you'd love me like that
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

// Too Much //

Am I bad for you?
'Cause I live for the fire, and the rain, and the drama too, boy
And it feels like you never say what you want
And it feels like I can't get through, babe
Ooh, babe

'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (Feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh ah

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

Am I too close?
'Cause you fold into me like a heart with a beat
I know now, I know now
And did you know that I'm wild for your skin
And the dance that we're in?
So close now, so close now

'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (Feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire, ooh ah

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

A fire in rainy season
It's hard to get to know me
Are you down, d-down
I'm down, d-down
I trust the, trust the feeling
It's hard to get to know you
But I'm down-do-down
I'm down-do-down

When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much

Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?

// The Sound //

(I give up, I give up
I give up, I give up)

I've been testing out the waters
I don't think I can swim, love
With the way you rock me 'round
And I feel it, more than just desire
I don't think I can breathe
With the way you let me down

God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it

I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the

Fool's gold landed on my shoulder
In the weight of your hand
But you know the answer's no (Know the answer's no)
And you know I'm a liar
Oh, the night's my weakness
I believe every word
'Cause your lips are waterfalls

God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me-)

I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)

I'm for you now, I feel my fortune tell me I'm the only one
The only one
I'm for you now (Is it desire?), it's sweet until it's over
I'm the only one (Is it desire?), the only one

God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
(Isn't this the vision that you wanted?)
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
(Love is more than telling me-)

I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(I need it)
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
(I give up, I give up)
I don't need the words, I want the sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
(I give up, I give up)
I don't need the words, I want the

// Automatically In Love //

I never thought about you
You never thought about us
Yeah, it came out of the blue
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need for your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real roller-coaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every morning with you
I wake up just dreaming

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Never guess what came after
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I fell

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real roller-coaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

In love, in love
Mm, la-da-da-da-da, da-da

Love's so fast, I can't go slow
Hold me back
Baby boy, oh, hold me close
Love's so real, I can't go slow
Can't imagine, right away, I feel it so

Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real roller-coaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We were automatically in love (In love)

Mm, mm
Hmm, hmm
Automatically

// Feels Right //

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something

One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Electric Guest):]
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
Now I'd do, boy
Anything to step with you

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
True fact
Baby, I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right
(Maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say

One more night with you always turns to two
I can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Electric Guest):]
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
And I'd do, boy
Anything to step with you

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life for no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Electric Guest):]
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
('Cause it feels like I've never loved)
Now I'd do, boy
Anything to step with you

// Right Words Wrong Time //

We put everything away
California wasn't made for you
Hate the traffic in LA
I drove through it all to get to you

Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong

I don't wanna see your face
I'm afraid I couldn't wait for you
I'm afraid that I would break
Only want me when I'm leaving you

Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me

My baby, my baby
You always got the right words at the wrong time
This time, it's heartbreaking
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time
For me, for me
You always got the right words at the wrong time

Baby boy, you've always got the right words
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late, I gotta say now)
Baby boy, you've always got the right words
(That you should go, yeah, you should go home)
But you always say them at the wrong time
(It's getting late)

My baby (It's getting late)
My baby (And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(It's getting late)
This time, it's heartbreaking (It's getting late now)
(And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
(And you should go, you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
('Cause) You always got the right words at the wrong time

// Real Love //

The world is going crazy
And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now
We're getting good at lying
No one's saying what's keeping us all awake at night
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now

Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, and you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

All the chaos falling 'round
I watch it like a movie that has come to life
Something kind of numb about the way I keep on drowning it out
Danger, I feel danger
And I cannot find the breath to scream the words out right
Every thought is paralyzing, need to find a way to you now

Standing here with you tonight, how do we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
And I'm so used to the lie, you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love
Real, real, real love

I go everyday without it
All I want is real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
I'm not even scared about it
All I want is real, real love
But I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love

// For Sure //

Six in the morning, can I hold you?

I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure

I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Ahh!
I was thinking we were over
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
I was thinking we were over
Ahh!
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(Ayy, ayy, ah-ah!)
I was thinking we were over

// Party For One //

If you didn't know that you were right for me
Then there's nothing I can say
Tried to call you out to spend some time to see
But somebody's in your way
Tried to let it go and say I'm over you
I'm not over you
But I'm trying

Party for one
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
I'll be the one
If you don't care about me
Making love to myself
Back on my beat

You don't want my love
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
Party for one
If you don't care about me
Making love to myself
Back on my beat
Ah, ah, ah

Once upon a time, I thought you wanted me
Was there no one else to kiss?
(No one else to kiss)
Was it all a dream I let myself believe?
I'm not over this
(I'm not over this)
But I'm trying

Party for one (Hey)
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
I'll be the one
If you don't care about me
(You don't care that I'm)
Making love to myself
Back on my beat

You don't want my love
If you don't care about me
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
(Back on my beat)
Party for one
If you don't care about me
(You don't care about me)
Making love to myself
(Hey)
Back on my beat

Ah, ah, ah (Back on my beat)
Ah, ah, ah

(Back on my beat)
Back on my beat
Back on my beat
Party for one
'Cause you don't care about me
Back on my beat
Back on my beat
Party for one
Back on my beat

You don't want my love
If you don't care about me
(You don't care about me)
I'll just dance for myself
Back on my beat
(Back on my beat)
Party for one
If you don't care about me
(You don't care that I'm)
Making love to myself
Back on my beat
Ah

Back on my beat
Back on my beat (Ah)
Party for one (Ah)
(Back on my beat)
Back on my beat
Back on my beat (Ah)
Party for one
Ah
