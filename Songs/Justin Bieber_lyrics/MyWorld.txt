// Favorite Girl //

I always knew you were the best
The coolest girl I know
So prettier than all the rest, the star of my show
So many times I wished you'd be the one for me
But never knew you'd get like this, girl
What'd you do to me?

You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one

My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite girl

You're used to going out your way to impress these Mr. Wrongs
But you can be yourself with me
I'll take you as you are
I know they said believe in love
It's a dream that can't be real
So girl, let's write a fairytale and show 'em how we feel

You're who I'm thinking of
And girl, you ain't my runner-up
And no matter what, you're always number one

My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
I want you
It's you, it's you
My favorite, my favorite
My favorite, my favorite girl
My favorite, girl

You take my breath away with everything you say
I just want to be with you, my baby, my baby
Oh-oh, promise I'll play no games
Treat you no other way than you deserve
'Cause you're the girl of my dreams

My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady
The one that makes me crazy
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you

My prize possession, one and only
Adore you, girl, I want you (I want you, oh)
The one I can't live without
That's you, that's you
You're my special little lady (my special little lady)
The one that makes me crazy (the one that makes me crazy)
Of all the girls I've ever known, it's you, it's you
(You're my favorite girl)
My favorite, my favorite
(Favorite girl) My favorite, my favorite girl
(Favorite girl) My favorite, girl
(Favorite girl)
My favorite, my favorite
(Favorite girl) My favorite, my favorite girl
(Favorite girl) My favorite girl
Favorite girl

// Down To Earth //

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

// Bigger //

Mafia
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger, big

Gotta believe in me (Gotta believe in me)
Believe me like a fairy tale
Your tooth under your pillowcase
No, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a seesaw let you down (Oh)
You know why?
'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, whoa

Remember when my heart was young?
It was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would've got rid of me (Hey)
Now the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because we ain't pushovers, no more, baby

We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger, whoa

Remember those stone-washed jeans (I remember that)
Don't knock your earrings (Like yesterday)
They shined on me (We were little then)
In class daydreaming of you (My baby)
(Just remember) You, wow wow
Since then all I can remember is the love's only gotten bigger
It's gone out of control

I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger (Bigger)
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small (so small) from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger (Our love's bigger)
I'm bigger (I'm bigger) and you're bigger (you're bigger), hey hey, hey
I was a player when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heart breaker when I was little
But I'm bigger, (I'm bigger) I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here
'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger
I'm bigger (I ain't small no more) and you're bigger, whoa

// First Dance //

[Usher:]
It's your chance take her hand to the floor
Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you're ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man

[Justin Bieber:]
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

[Usher:]
It's your chance take her hand to the floor, to the floor
Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man

[Justin Bieber:]
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime

// Love Me //

My friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
'Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
'Cause you're my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that you miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

My heart is blind but I don't care
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared
And every time I hold ya near
I never want to let ya go, oh

Love me, love me, say that you love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
Love me, love me, say that ya love me
Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me

// Common Denominator //

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, whoa

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, whoa, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again

There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

Il y a des mots qu'aujourd'hui on se dit mais qui nous font du tort
Et qui ne valent rien quand on les retient et Ã§a rien que pour y croire encore
Tu gardes les mots qui restent intacts et les larmes qui coulent sur ton corps
Mais si je reste avec toi, there'll be the one less lonely girl

Oh oh, aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you, I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you
No no, c'est avec toi que je veux Ãªtre plus que tout
And when you're mine in the world, there's gonna to be one less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, je me tiens devant toi
I'm coming for you, tu peux marcher dans mes pas
That's what I'm gonna do if you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Mais Ã§a n'est qu'un souvenir dans ta vie, il y a trop d'espace entre vous
MÃªme les heures passÃ©es Ã  toujours penser, ne servent Ã  rien aprÃ¨s tout
Et tellement de mots perdus sur des pages, et des larmes qui coulent sur ton corps (Encore)
Mais si je reste avec toi, there'll be the one less lonely girl

Oh oh, aucun autre visage ne m'a rendu fou
Now all I see is you, I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you
No no, c'est avec toi que je veux Ãªtre plus que tout
And when you're mine in this world, there's gonna to be one less lonely girl

That's what I'm gonna do if you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Il faut seulement que tu t'en sortes, il faut que tu passes la porte pour que je te dÃ©livre
Tu n'as seulement qu'Ã  le dire plus fort, free to fall, un peu plus fort, fall in love
Je prie pour qu'aujourd'hui tu commences ta vie
Avec moi je promets, you'll be one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl

I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
I'm coming for you, one less lonely girl
