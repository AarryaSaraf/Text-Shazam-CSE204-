Yeah (Okay)
Once again (All around the world-world-world)
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda

[Ludacris:]
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that

[Justin Bieber:]
All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world

All around the world
(All around the world, the world, people wanna be loved)
All around the world
(All around the world, the world, they're no different than us)
All around the world-world-world

// Catching Feelings //

Sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me
I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be?
Could this be happening to me, yeah?
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by?
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what am I supposed to do?

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

In my head, we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

Should I tell her how I really feel?
Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
'Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?

Could it be a possibility?
I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me
Maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm catching feelings
Catching feelings, girl

Catching feelings, catching feelings

// Die In Your Arms //

Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy
(Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)
But it sure is worth a try
(Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright)

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson, then baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do just to stay right next to you

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly, the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So baby, baby, please don't stop, girl

Basically, I'm staying here

// Be Alright //

Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night

Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you

And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything

'Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright
