// Fall //

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself

Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby

// As Long As You Love Me (Acoustic Version) //

As long as you love me, yeah, oh, yeah

We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning

But hey now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me, oh

I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl

Don't stress and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
But just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me, uh

I don't know if this makes sense, but, you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, I'll rendezvous it
I'll fly you to it, I'll beat you there, girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we on top of the world, that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
Now we steppin' out like oh God, cameras point and shoot
Ask me, "What's my best side?" I stand back and point at you, you, you
The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues, baby, true, true, true, but I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, that's all I want, all I need, baby
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me, you love, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me yeah, yeah

// Yellow Raincoat //

Cause I'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It's what it's for yeah, it's what it's for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me?
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me?

// I Would //

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

I would build the love of river wide so that it never runs dry, yeah
Any time you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right, I just can't read your mind, no

And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want, it's all about what you need
I know that he hurt you, but that wasn't me
And I know and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That I'm where you need to be, oh

If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

// Nothing Like Us //

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together

I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
