[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo it's the Steel City stick up kid and I'm totin' that heavy metal

I got the hood soldiers like chiefs and arabs
The game gets shook, wack rappers is terrified
Killin' all of my kids, this is lyrical genocide
I write a rap, spit a rap, and it ain't no sweat
Can't quit, I'm in too deep like, Omar Epps
They treat me like I killed Bishop cause I got mo' Juice
Than OJ in a bronco, lay it down pronto
I keep a bad bitch cause my cock is mean
I'm about to get ya girl looser than a slot machine

Talkin' 'bout you gon' kill a nigga
Man I wish I would catch one of you niggas with' a pistol tryna kill my cousin nigga

[Freddie Gibbs:]
I ain't scared of gettin' murked

Before it's all over, I empty the fuckin' tec out
Them hollow point hydro shots will blow yo' chest out
Or hit you in the throat and blow the back of yo' neck out
When there's beef I ain't the one to sit in the crib
I'm outchea splittin' them wigs, call me General Gibbs
Raise yo' hand and salute fo' I aim and shoot

So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?

This is dedicated to the cookies of the industry
I got enough friends, I'm lookin' for enemies
Cause I'm a brand new problem you gotta deal with'
I represent for them niggas spittin' that real shit
These muthafuckas stack a little bit of change and claim that they the hardest
And y'all lames go out and buy this garbage
I gotta keep it real, the rap game is wack now
Even these niggas from immature tryna rap now
I'mma give niggas some food for thought
Go trash that bullshit you bought
Before yo' ass get caught in the wrong hood
Bumpin' the wrong shit
Niggas'll laugh at you, leave you gettin' ya dome split
I'm about to drive these niggas insane
And I know they wanna diss me back, so while they pickin' they brain
I'll be chillin' in the regal homes
Witcha girl in the backseat givin' me dome, gettin' her eagle on

Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?

Yo I'mma tell a true story about my nigga Pimp
He bumped into this nigga Chingy sittin' in his whip
He told him he was from the G and Chingy sped off
I guess he thought he was gon' blow his fuckin' head off
That nigga soft and the music that he make is for certified cookies
The rhymes he be spittin' is soft as wet pussy
You went plat' I'm congratulating that
But you ain't the king of the Midwest, your shit is whack
Man I rap for them niggas that hustle out of the crack spot
Niggas don't be ridin' around bumpin' that jackpot
Man trust me, my hood ain't feelin' him
His voice sound like he been inhalin' helium
This is how I get down
You may beat me at spittin' raps, we can spit rounds nigga
Lay him down with the fo' pound
And have my people run a muck on ya whole town
Youse a clown

Yo y'all ain't ready for the way I'm 'bout to take rap
Am I supposed to be happy now that Mase back?
I seen a ad in a book: Mase coming soon
But really though, what's the difference between him and Loon?
Man I don't know, man it seem like P. Diddy done lost his mind
He picked up Ball & G cause he lost his Shyne, get it?
I guess he needed some gangstas on his roster
Them band muthafuckas wasn't nothin' but imposters
A lotta y'all rappers suck to me
And you wouldn't have a deal if it was up to me
But it ain't so, do what ya do
Same way Pac shut niggas down, I can do it to you
I'm real muthafucka, if I talk it, I lived it
I ain't takin' notihin' back, if I said it, I meant it
I don't really give a damn about you bein' offended
Fuck with' me and your career will get ended
Nigga what

Ayo I'm from the gutta
And I've been livin' gutta
So I'mma keep it gutta
Until I'm gone brotha
So where you at nigga?

// Freestyle #1 //

You remember that, motherfucker
Cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about, partner

Yeah, aight
Let's do some old school shit right quick man
Yeah, aight, yeah
Ugh, it's Freddie Gibbs
Yeah, I get on these-
I do my job on these tracks man
Yo, okay, yo, aight

Now every beat I ever got on I helped that bitch
And every rhyme that I spit, niggas felt that shit
I ain't ever came wack, I don't spit lame raps
The mic, I blazed that
Nothing gon' change that
From this rhymes that I dictate, niggas know I spit great
Since the release date, of my first mixtape
I been full metal jackin' these muthafuckas
Spittin' flows and outrappin' these muthafuckas
Freddie's a muthafucka, face it man
I'm the deal like that group Babyface was in
My style like a jagged edge penetratin' ya skin
So fuck walkin' outta heaven, you'll be walkin' in
Been the illest since my mama pushed me outta her womb
Now I'm 'bout to drop a album the game is doomed
I'mma sit back and watch the smoke fill the room
The clock just struck twelve and I'm higher than noon
Haha, yeah
Roc, pass the dro
Mane, I'm lookin' for some more grass to blow

// My Drunk Uncle //

[Big Time Watts:]
I said hey, I come in the house, I come in the house
My nephew steal all my legs, he steal, all better, Freddie Gibbs
He steal all the shit in my house
[?] on the microphone
He took everythang from me
You know what I'm sayin'?
I say hey, he took everythang from me
Big Time Watts in the house

[?] I'm livin' life
And it's the truth on the microphone
He took everythang from me
He took everythang

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Ugh, yeah
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs

// GIBBS //

DJ turn me up in the headphones a little bit
Aight, lettin' niggas know who it is, nigga
No Tamin' run it to 'em
This how we do it

I'm gettin' tired of these naysayers, playa haters, and imitators
I'm blessed by the creator, I'm a fucking innovator
Niggas wanna see me heated, they nothin' but instigators
I just keep my temper down, as cool as refridgerators
Hear me know or hear me later
But sooner or later
You gon' have to deal with' me
Homie keep it real with' me
Do you want to battle rap?
Or do you want me to clap you?
With the bullets or the lyrics, I can handicap you
Leave you permanently leanin' like the tower of Pisa
You a cookie, your heart sweeter than Mother Theresa
You should get down on yo' knees and have a talk with' Jesus
And pray to God you don't bump heads with' Caesar
The black one, ready for action
Don't get me confused with other rappers, I am not the wack one
I don't rap for the platinum
I'm just tryna get my family outta the hood like Joseph Jackson
Now I got a little fame, it's hard to shake dames
I fuck these bitches and never remember their name
I'm the incredible, heterosexual, lyric professional
I flow perpetual, turnin' these rappers into vegetables

And if you thinkin' you better then think again
Cause I'm sicker with these similes, nouns, verbs, and synonyms
If you ain't feelin' Gibbs, then you ain't feelin' rap
You ain't ever felt real hip hop, you feelin' dat?

It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy
Ugh, yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga yeah
Bring it back
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy (nigga)
Yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga (ugh, yeah let's do it)

Verse 2, time to show these muthafuckas what I'm made of
And give the industry somethin' that they afraid of
I got credibility, all my dudes is paid up
All you aspiring rap artists, getcha weight up
Y'all niggas spittin' elementary rhymes
Sellin' dope and wastin' yo' money on studio time
When I take a look at my city it brings me to laughter
Cause every other nigga that I meet is a rapper
Tryna get my money for his music
Say he got skill, but the nigga can't prove it
Seems like lyricism is long gone
Niggas scared for feature me on their shit cause I kill them on they own song
These other rappers don't write like me
So there'll never be an MC quite like me
And he can say that he's the hottest rapper out of the G
But you can be your bottom dollar he ain't hotter than me
Now I got a little rank, yo' career about to sank
Keep hatin', I'mma be laughin' all the way to the bank haha
I'm 'bout to make it I'm stripping the game naked
And you say you want the title? well homie step up and take it

Woah, you still thinkin' you better? well think again
Cause I'm sicker with these similes, nouns, verbs, and synonyms
If you ain't feelin' Gibbs, then you ain't feelin' rap
You ain't ever felt real hip hop, you feelin' dat? nigga

It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy
Ugh, yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga yeah
Bring it back
It's Freddie G to the izz-I, B to the bizzy
S, oh yes the best rapper from the Gizzy (nigga)
Yo what's my name homie?
Freddie Gangsta Gibbs nigga (ugh, let's do it)

Yeah, y'all know who it is
Freddie Gibbs nigga
Full Metal Jackit Volume 2 niggas
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's that nigga John Doe aka DJ
For y'all niggas that don't muthafuckin' know this No Tamin' nigga

Yeah, to all you rappers that are out there, straight up
Ugh, let's do it, aight

Yo if you say you won't lose I'mma prove you already lost
Don't try to play hard you niggas already soft
My flows is A1, spittin' nothin' but the best shit
All of my rhymes go hard like an erect dick
A lotta people say Freddie Gibbs commercial
Don' get it twisted, Freddie Gibbs'll hurt you
And if I; m popped I'll murk you
Like my liquor brown or white and my weed green or purple
I stay controversial, bring the heat in the booth
One take, I don't need rehearsal
I'mma spit my verse and I'm leavin'
I work hard to be the illest rapper out of the region
From the G to the H and D, to the harbor
Ain't a nigga that can fade me but my barber
So I don't really gotta tell you who I'm better than
This rap rookie be shockin' all of the veterans
If you talkin' shit you get silenced
Keep it to a minimum, don't start the violence
I'll hit ya whole team if you ever fuck with' me
Ya boyz n the hood, they get killed like Ricky
You motherfuckin' loser
When it's time to ride y'all niggas punk out like Cuba Gooding Jr
So I know you afraid to get blazed
Niggas on my team got tecs and AKs
What you gon' do when shit hits the fan?
If the bullets miss you they gon' hit ya man
Like I told you before, if you scared go to church
I'mma be out on the block gettin' my merch
You thinkin' I ain't 'bout the money? Negro please
I'm on top of my chips like nacho cheese
So from now 'til I'm gon' don't ask me for shit
To get me on a song, gon' cost niggas a grip
I ain't talkin' 'bout niggas I'm cool with'
I'm talkin' 'bout them other niggas I don't fool with'
You prolly think I'm arrogant and actin' foul
But we wasn't cool then so we not cool now
I should start my own rap convention
Cause niggas like what I'm talkin' 'bout like tension
Roll with' Freddie, you'll fuck a lotta hotties
Put me on ya album you'll sell a lotta copies nigga

Aye, aye, aye, check it out
Freddie I know you got some more shit to say

// Freestyle #3 //

[Finger Roll:]

This is Freddie Gibbs
Y'all motherfuckers better recognize

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo, I'm the best rapper from my city man it ain't no question
This is more than just a hobby, this is my profession
Y'all still talkin' shit, I thought you learned y'all lesson
Understand you can never stop my progression
Man I'm rappin' with' no regrets
Freestyle muthafucka, no pen, no paper, no sweat
No break, no hook, no bitches, no singin'
This is no joke, no mercy, No Tamin'
Seesaw, Vicious, Reese, and Roll
Plus ya boy Freddie Gibbs, man we outta control
My niggas is real soldiers
Y'all muthafuckas need to roll with' us cause you 'bout to get rolled over
I'm sayin' it in the nicest way
You like to play, you can lose your life today
Hey, and I ain't sayin' that I'm harder than y'all
I'm just sayin' that I'm a whole lot smarter than y'all
You can tell by my interviews
Y'all niggas is dumb as Blade Brown and geeks like Duncan Pinderhughes
Just another fuckin' class act
Another nigga that I blast at
Bitch, where the cash at?
It ain't no secret I'm after the bread man
I'm tryna get wealthy before I'm a dead man
Ugh, show me the money cause I rip these beats
If I'm eatin', every nigga in my clique gon' eat
If I'm shinin', every nigga in my clique gon' shine
Cause I know that every nigga in my clique gon' grind
And I know that every nigga in yo' clique is a lame
You motherfuckin' bird brains can't handle the game
What is you niggas insane? You don't want it with' dis
Keep my name out yo' mouth, you don't wanna get dissed
When I diss you, I scratch ya name off my list
Then I tell ya lil bitch to get off my dick
Now I'm rappin' all these hoes be givin' me coochie-coupons
Take me to the crib, then I fuck 'em on they futon
Bitch please, I don't love you girl
You just another hoe tryna be a part of my world
I can rap about yo' woman cause I actually hit it
I don't rap about no shit if I ain't actually did it
I can bring it to you live right in front of ya face
I be murderin' everybody, it don't matter their race
I be slicin' up asians, blacks, and white people
Latin niggas say "we can't fuck with Fred DeRico"
"He sorta like Deebo, snatchin' ya jewelry"
But I don't take a beatin' at the end of this movie, huh
Motherfucka

Got your people singin' it's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
When I pull that semi out and took your fuckin' breathe away
When it come to the heaters, you know that I don't ever play
I bust an AK, you can put ya fuckin' chess away
F-R-E-double-D to the-I-E
Mess around with' me you'll be eatin' through a IV
You think you notorious? You ain't ready to die G
Push me to the edge, I dare you niggas to try me
Niggas should be shook up, I diss niggas quick
Next time you look up, they'll be playin' that shit at hook ups
Homie, in Indiana I'm the governor
But niggas in the hood want you outta the picture like George W
My flow make you hold yo' chest
You thinkin' I'mma fall off? Man don't hold yo' breath
You muthafuckas better (breathe)
I'm connected with' Puerto Ricans and Mexicans
And niggas that push more keys than Duke Ellington
But I ain't gotta touch no work
I got game, I could pimp a hoe to get my merch
I get ya girl then I treat her like a filthy slut
She let me fuck now I can't get her off my nuts
She won't let a nigga (breathe)
A lotta niggas wanna smoke this dude
And make me front page news on the post tribune
But I will never ever bite my tongue
I been the illest since the Lord blew breath in my lungs
You other niggas can't (breathe)

Yeah
Bitch nigga, y'all can't breathe
This No Tamin' Entertainment in this bitch
Yeah
Freddie Gibbs, all y'all niggas talkin' that gibberish about shut ya muthafuckin' mouth homeboy
Don't make me call you out
It's the one right here baby
Niggas that I used to go to school with', be cool with'
Nah I don't fool-

// Dead Or Alive //

It's No Tamin
Aye, I want you to sip your drink if you got one
And go up to a nigga you don't like, and hit his punk ass!
And say, "No Tamin, bitch!"
'Cause we 'bout to go
What's up, let's go, Freddie Gibbs!

These motherfuckers gon' respect my rhymes
They think that I'm a pretty boy, they like to rap about them girls all the time
They be hatin' on my shit, 'cause they shit don't sell
I'm way ahead of most niggas, they don't spit this well
If the real shit is dead, then I'm bringin' it back
Even if I gotta piss some niggas off when I rap
My nigga Dove said I'm steppin' on a lot of niggas' toes
But I let 'em know that I respect a lot of niggas' flows
But a lot of niggas don't deserve the love that I gave to 'em
Especially when they don't give it back, I bring the pain to 'em
Man, I don't give a fuck about a nigga ego
I'm tryna stack my paper like De Niro in Casino
Like Nicky Tarantino, my tolerance is zero
Cross one of my people, it's, "Adios, amigo"
Uh, they wanna take me out this game, nigga, no way
I go against the grain and beat my case like O. J

Yeah, dead or alive, baby
Dead or alive, I be the hottest nigga in the streets
Straight up, man, the haters want me gone
Real niggas wanna hear me, you know what I'm sayin'?

These motherfuckers don't cooperate until you throw some dollars at 'em
Man, I'm tired of talkin' to these niggas, Vicious, holler at 'em
The most inconsiderate, most belligerent
These flows is ignorant; yours, insignificant
You niggas get annihilated when you violate the rap code, the essence
These flows is epic
Yo boy is reckless, my legacy is bigger than the motherfuckin' hemisphere
You niggas stuck like Gilligan
And I'll kill again; just because the barrel dusty
Don't think I won't leave you stressed with yo apparel, buddy
I'm a terror, buddy; rap's [?]
Lyrically, you malnourished, niggas really bore me
You tell stories of how sick you are
Bitch, you get no cigar
'Cause lyrically, I insinerate you bitches
Penetrate you bitches watch your hoes like disintegrate, you bitches
So next time, you better step and guess your mission
'Fore [?] Freddie Gibbs and Vicious, bitches!

Yeah this real shit, man, No Tamin
Freddie, [?]
Yo, they want me dead or alive, man
I'm just gettin' started in this game
I ain't begin to play with you faggots yet, man
It's comin', this the '04, '05
Freddie Gibbs, Vicious, masters of the Midwest
Finger Roll, No Tamin, we doin' this
Fuck you niggas, take it how you wanna take it

What up, nigga, this is Finger Roll, you know what I'm sayin'?
The nigga that you love to hate, motherfucker
The one that you see on the back of them CD covers, motherfucker
The one that you open up
The one that lookin' at yo- yo favorite fuckin' artist while
He's being recorded, nigga
I'm the fuckin' one!
Let's do that shit, nigga
The one that's doing the beats on the streets, nigga
Call me Mr. G.I. if you wanna call it
Mr. Indiana, that's how it's going down, nigga
No Tamin, what it is, let's go!

Yo when you got paroled, man?
Yo, man, I just got paroled the other day, man
That shit is cool, man, I hope you taking care of yourself, word up
Come on, man, it's Blizz, of course I'm taking care of myself, man
It's nice to see you, man
Yeah, pardon me for a second, I'm 'bout to rob this place
Alright, everybody, put your fucking hands in the air and face the fucking wall!
Don't look at me, goddamit!
Ayo, Q, you want piece of this?
Nah, man, I'm out here
All right, everybody, strip!

// Freestyle #4 //

Yeah
Ugh, yeah
Oh, it's time to set the record straight homie
Freddie Gibbs, best rapper from the G
Yeah, aight, matter fact best rapper in the state man
Get ya weight up
DJ Roc, time to show 'em where I'm from baby

Yo, I'm from the 219 where bitch ass niggas get faded fast
But I'm like a Ford truck, I'm built to last
Built to blast, leavin' ya block scared of me
I'm playin' doctor, givin' niggas Glock therapy
Head of the class, I'm educated to get dough
Niggas is slow like bruh man from the fifth floor
Guard ya grill, you don't really want the war for real
I make niggas break fast like a mornin' meal
What the deal? If you ready for Freddie let's get it crackalatin'
Shots to ya spine leave you dyin', now ya back is achin'
And now you paralyzed from the waist down
From the neck down, we got K's so put ya tech down
Hey, Freddie's the young black Caesar
If ya credit right then discover me, I'm like Jesus
Freestylin', you can't walk the way I talk
You can't talk the way I walk, niggas, ugh, get sparked

Ugh, Freddie Gibbs
Off the dome ladies and gentlemen
Nigga, my album this is my hustle comin' soon, yeah
DJ Roc, yes

// 2 Gangsta //

All my gangstas hit the flo'
For some gangsta music

They don't really wanna test my gangsta
They don't really wanna test my gangsta
Nah, I don't think they wanna test my gangsta (oh)
I don't think they wanna test our gangsta (oh)
I don't think they wanna test my gangsta (oh)
Nah, they don't (oh)

They say this boy too gangsta for the radio
But I'm such a hot commodity, I bet your favorite station still play me though
Because I spit well, I need to stop, drop, and roll
I'm a man on fire like Denzel
All hail, this young cat, rap, I run that
Hustle hard, I done that, makin' my funds stacks
Stay away from dumb cats, they get you stung black
You gon' wonder where yo' lungs at when that [*scratch*] clap
If it's wack, I don't bump that
I like that gangsta music, and I'm tired of all this bubblegum rap
Cause ain't nothin' fake about how I'm livin', homie I'm real with' it
You don't like the way that I'm spittin'? Then come and deal with' it
Chill with' it, you better keep yo' cool
Please don't be nobody's fool cause I keep my tool
I ain't quite like them other guys
If you ain't feelin' what I'm sayin' then you gotta be dumb, deaf, or paralyzed

They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

Verse 2, let's keep it goin', keep it poppin', keep it movin'
Keep it crackalackin', my gangstas keep groovin'
Keep it thorough, with or without my crew
And you don't do dat, dat's the difference between me and you
See me, I keep it gutta, keep it hood, keep it gangsta
You keep it lame, keep it fake, keep it wanksta
And you be rappin' 'bout things you never did
And makin' songs about a life you never lived
Your lyrics straight garbage when you spittin' 'em out
You should live in a trash can like Oscar the Grouch
Take it straight back to Sesame Street
Freddie be rippin' the beat, so on the mic you could never compete
Ah you lookin' kinda mad, what's the matter? It's a shame
I can see straight through you, I guess yo' daddy was a glassmaker
So sit there and try to figure it out, real Gs know what I'm talkin' about
Yup, keep it gangsta

They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

Homie, I went from ashy to nasty to classy
And these honeys on my jock used to look past me
Now they breakin' they neck to sexually harass me
Then they man find out and wanna come blast me
But I ain't worried 'bout it (I ain't worried 'bout it)
Cause I got way bigger fish to fry
I want my slice of the pie befo' it's time to die
It ain't hard for me to catch yo' eye
People say I'm so gangsta and wonder why I dress so fly
You ain't know? I'm in the polo, fresh air forces
Tall, dark, and handsome, man, I'm so gorgeous
Rocks in my Jacob watch is so flawless
Rappin' or grindin', I'm gettin' mine regardless
I'm the illest, you can claim to be the hardest
Cause I'mma be eatin' while y'all dudes is still starvin'
Beggin' for yo' turn like a busta
Yo' careers over, gon' and let it burn like Usher

They don't like the way I talk, I'm too gangsta
My style and the way that I walk, it's too gangsta
So they don't want me up in da club, I'm too gangsta
This for one for my thugs, show me some love
Aye, aye, aye, oh, I'm too gangsta
I'm too gangsta, I'm too gangsta
Too gangsta, too gangsta

Yeah, yeah here we go (gangstas strike back)

// Never Can Say Goodbye //

Ugh, yeah, yeah, ugh
I guess I never could say goodbye
This is my love song
Respect it

Yo, I started off as a young dude with' dreams of playin' football
Then I went to college where I learned how to cook raw
My pockets was feelin' empty, I was feelin' worried
I gotta hustle these dime out of my dormitory
I bagged up in my grandma crib
Served on the same block where my grandma live
Same place I used to play as a kid
Same hood where the girls around the corner let me get in them ribs
Same block where my uncles used to keep up drama
Same spot where my daddy fell in love with my mama
I fell in love with the game
Cause you can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out my veins
The ghetto's in my blood, you cut me I bleed this
I'mma eat, sleep, and breathe this, believe this
I'mma fight for the crib 'til my knuckles is purple
Steel city, I would never desert you
On the record yeah

I never could, never have, and I never will
Ugh, ugh this for the block
Ugh this for the block
Steel city
Never could, never have, and I never will

I was a hustler man, infatuated with' gettin' the dough
At nineteen I discovered I was sick with the flow
But I was listenin' to rap in elementary school
After bumpin' Scarface, I would listen to Cube
Then I switched it over to Eric B. and Rakim
Back then, I thought there wun't nobody harder than them
Everybody from Cool J to Kool G Rap
Used to make my head nod and my fingers snap
Hip hop took control and captivated my brain
Now I need it, I gotta have it cause it's keepin' me sane
I don't rap for the fame, or the dames, or the change
I just do it simply and plain for the love of the game
They say music soothes the savage beast, I'm livin' proof
So I'm comfortable as ever when I'm up in the booth
Although the business full of snakes and people that can hurt you
Hip hop I would never desert you
I'm addicted mane, ugh

I never could, never have, and I never will
I said I never could, never have, and I never will
Ugh, yeah for my people
This for my people

Yo, and I would like to thank my mother and my father for raisin' me right
You not to blame for the bad things I did in my life
I know that havin' two good parents is truly a gift
You the reason why I even exist, why I can rap like this
To my grannies and the rest of my fam
Just believe in me and I'mma do the best that I can
Willie Watts, Uncle Wayne, Mike Lang, and my nigga Quade
You might be gone but your memory is here to stay
B Lang, I know it hurt to lose your only brother
But while I'm here you got a brother from another mother
That's on my mama homie, that goes for all of my dogs
Man just give me a call when you got drama homie
Cause this cold world can break ya heart
When it does you can lean on me like Joe Clark
Life is hard and when it's gettin' controversial
Understand that I will never desert you
I got love for you

Ugh
I never could, never have, and I never will
Ugh, I can't
For all my people mane ugh
I never could, never have, and I never will

This for the block, for hip hop
For my people, ugh, yeah
Never ever
I guess I never could say goodbye
Freddie Gibbs
