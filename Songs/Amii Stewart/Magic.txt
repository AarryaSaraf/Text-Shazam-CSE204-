// Don't Be So Shy //

Ok, let's go for it, give me the key, baby
Ok

Tell me why you're so shy, baby
Don't you know I want to get close to you
Baby, come to me
'Cause I got what you need

Oh, why you're so shy, tell me
Why you're so shy, oh, oh, oh

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh

Are you feelin' all alone boy
Thinkin' that no one could understand
If you'd only reach out boy
Maybe then someone would take your hand

'Cause I'd like to get to know you
But you've got to make your move
If you want it, then come and get it
Can't you see that I'm attracted
Baby don't keep holdin' back
Make your move, and make it soon
See what I'm sayin'

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh, oh
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh
Are you lonely on your own boy
I can understand the way you feel
If you'd only reach out boy
And let me prove to you this feeling's real

'Cause I'd like to get to know you
But you've got to make your move
If you want it, then come and get it
Can't you see that I'm attracted
Baby don't keep holdin' back
Make your move, and make it soon
See what I'm sayin'

Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh, oh
Don't be so shy
'Cause you're my kinda guy
I'm here to let you know, oh oh

Better check me out boy
'Cause I wanna know
Do you want to touch me (really want me)
Then let me know

So shy, so shy

I may appear to be shy
But I'm just a bit reserved
Waitin' for you to give the world
How you'll hold me and never scold me
Never, never scold me

'Cause I'd like to get to know ya
Baby make your move

Now I don't wanna lie
Yeah, I'm just a little shy

See what I'm sayin'
Don't be so shy...

// Don't Stop //

Heal this lonely heart
Living in the dark
With a special tender touch
Knowing to share would be much more than
Living day to day
Trying to find a way
To keep it together, whatever
You gave all yourself
So many times before
Left broken hearted
When they parted, yeah, yeah
I've been down that road
When you can't see up from down
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop pushin', pushin'

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop

In the morning light
You hold your pillow tight
Knowing to face another day
Is gonna take everything you've got to give
All so bitter
It's not the way you planned
You got to keep it together
No matter whatever
All those smiling faces
Who stabbed you in the back
You should be trying, instead of crying, hey, hey
Now is the time to hold your head up high
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop pushin', pushin'

Don't stop pushin'
Don't stop
Everybody pushin'
Don't stop...

You gave all yourself
So many times before
Left broken hearted
When they parted, hey, hey
I've been down that road
When you can't see up from down
It's time for you
To turn your life around

Don't stop
Everybody pushin'
Don't stop...
