// All You Need Is Love //

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No-one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Lo-ove, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

Nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

// Love Songs //

I can never write a love song
I can never write a blue song
When I'm in love I am a lover
And I have always had the blues

I am afraid that no one sees me
What will they say when I am gone
It occurs to me I think I miss you
I think I've missed you all along

Out of the corner of my eye (out of the corner of my eye)
Not sure if I should think these things of you
Is it the wrong place at the wrong time
I think it's just my turn to lose

Thoughts of you could give me smile lines
I laugh myself to sleep because I knew (I knew)
We were talking âbout a fine line
It depends on who you're talking to

If it's any consolation
The blues have always had me too
And if I ever write a love song
I think I'll write it about you

// Way To You //

Way back when, when the days were young
We had our fun
Never cared much about being cool
Or growing old to play the old fool
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles and singing the blues
If I'm born into a pair of ramblin' shoes
I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll take my wings with a heart that's true
And find the way to you
Part of your life you spend paying your dues
Walking the miles in your old man shoes
When I finally find the way to shake loose
I'll tell you what I'll do
Hang my worry on a golden noose
And find the way to you
When we're all old and withering sages
Talkin' 'bout what might have been
Like a missing line or torn out pages
We're gonna miss you then
Walking the miles, singing the blues
Learning to love what god gives to you
If he gave me rockets on the bottom of my shoes
I tell you what I'd do
I'd burn my sole where the sun was new
And find the way
The way to you

// Us Again //

Close your eyes and count to three
I'm gonna make you proud of me
not today, but that's alright
we have got a long long time

I've got big plans and you do too
and we've got ways to make them true
when I get old and if I do
I'm gonna get there next to you

And you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind
they'll find us again

With a hand to hold the rail
count the years that we've got left
we've got the world by the tail
oh we just don't know it yet

But you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind

And you can count on me
and you can lean on me
and we can throw our dreams to the wind
they'll find us again
they'll find us again
they'll find us again

// Heaven //

Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh - once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Ya - nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more
Baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you
