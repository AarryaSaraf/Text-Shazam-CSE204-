// Hard Way Home //

Oooh
I sometimes lose my faith in luck
I don't know what I want to be when I grow up
I just count the rain
Wearing the floor through the boards again
I wish I could find a soul to steal
I could be the engine, you could be the wheel
When we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone

[CHORUS:]
Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

I never did learn how to follow the rules
I never was good at sleeping while the moon was full
I just lie and burn
Wreck my mind while the planet turns
I sometimes wish I could start again
I'd try and do the right things every now and then
I'd step in line
That's what I would do if I could turn back time

[CHORUS:]
Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

ooooooooooooh

I tell you how I want to live
Forget about the take
Forget about the give
I want to leave this town
Fake my death and never be found

[CHORUS:]
Oooh, follow my tracks
See all the times I should have turned back
Oooh, I wept alone
I know what it means to be on my own
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

I sometimes lose my faith in luck
I don't know what I want to be when I grow up
I just count the rain
Wearing the floor through the boards again
I wish I could find a soul to steal
I could be the engine, you could be the wheel
When we're driving home, I never have to worry about being alone

[CHORUS:]
Oooh, the things I have known
Looks like I'm taking the hard way home
Oooh, the seeds I've sown
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home
Taking the hard way home

// Raise Hell //

I've been down with a broken heart
Since the day I learned to speak.
The devil gave me a crooked start
When he gave me crooked feet.
But Gabriel done came to me
And kissed me in my sleep,
And I'll be singing like an angel
Until I'm six feet deep.

I found myself an omen and I tattoed on a sign
I set my mind to wandering and I walk a broken line.
You have a mind to keep me quiet
And although you can try,
Better men have hit their knees
And bigger men have died.

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell

You came upon a lightning strike
And eyes of bright clear blue
I took a tie from around my neck
And gave my heart to you.
I sent my love accross the sea
And though I didn't cry
That voice will haunt my every dream
Until the day I die.

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one tells
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell

I dug a hole inside my heart
To put you in your grave.
At this point it was you and me,
And mama didn't raise no slave.
You took my face in both your hands
And looked me in the eye
And I went down with such a force
That in your grave I lie.

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna raise, raise hell
There's a story no one's telling
You gotta raise, raise hell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell
Go on and ring that bell

// Save Part Of Yourself //

The sun came up and five years gone
Life goes on, yeah, life goes on
I wonder how you're gettin' by
The sun goes down and I feel blue
Now I toss 'cause my mind's on you
And I kind of miss your broken smile

Save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

I remember you and me
Lost and young and dumb and free
And unaware of years to come
Just a whisper in the dark
On the pavement in the park
You taught me how to love someone

So save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

When we walk into the sun
Or burn below for what we've done
Will you still call out for me?
Turn to light or fade to black
You don't look back, no, you don't look back
At what you might not wanna see

But save part of yourself for me
Won't you save part of yourself for me?

The sun goes down and five years gone
Life goes on, yes, life goes on
I hope you caught up with your dreams
I hope you saved part of yourself for me

Won't you save part of yourself for me?
Save part of yourself for me

// That Wasn't Me //

Hang on, just hang on for a minute
I've got something to say
I'm not asking you to move on or forget it
But these are better days
To be wrong all along and admit it, is not amazing grace
But to be loved like a song you remember
Even when you've changed

Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me

When you're lost you will toss every lucky coin you'll ever trust
And you'll hide from your God like he ever turns his back on us
And you will fall all the way to the bottom and land on your own knife
And you'll learn who you are even if it doesn't take your life

Tell me, did I go on a tangent?
Did I lie through my teeth?
Did I cause you to stumble on your feet?
Did I bring shame on my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
Whatever you've seen, that wasn't me
That wasn't me, oh that wasn't me

But I want you to know that you'll never be alone
I wanna believe, do I make myself a blessing to everyone I meet
When you fall I will get you on your feet
Do I spend time with my family?
Did it show when I was weak?
When that's what you've seen, that will be me
That will be me, that will be me
That will be me

// Keep Your Heart Young //

My grandpa gave me a wheat penny and I kept it in my pocket
Had big plans in my backyard to build me a space rocket
Talked to my brother on a fake CB that I made from a tic-tac box
Packed my snowballs nice and tight and in the middle I put rocks

Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growin' old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

Dad took the wheels off of my bike and he pushed me down a hill
But speed got the best of me and I took my first spill
That was back when alcohol was only used on cuts
Stung like hell so I jerked my leg and mama said it would give me guts

Don't trade in your tic-tac box for a ball on the end of the chain
And don't go spending grandpa's pennies buying into the game
You gotta keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

So take a picture of the one you love and put it in a locket
Go dig up your time capsule and the blueprints for your rocket
Keep in touch on a fake CB and that same old tic-tac box
Pack your snowballs a little less tight but in the middle: still put rocks

And keep your heart young
Don't go growing old before your time has come
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

You gotta keep your heart young
Sometimes you don't die quick
Just like you wished you'd done
The love is a loaded gun
You've gotta keep your heart young
You can't take back what you have done
You gotta keep your heart young

// 100 //

When I'm blowin out the candles
And when people start to sing
I will always cross my fingers tight
I remember everything

But I always make my wishes
For the same thing everytime
If I live to be one hundred
If I ever get it right

My mind is racing with thoughts
And the songs that never end
And I prayed to God last night
Just before I went to bed

Even now I can't remember
A single word He said
If I live to be one hundred
If I get it through my head

I always think about you
And I have to close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

When you close your eyes at night
And you rise above your life
Do you notice there, an empty space
Where I wasn't by your side

Because I always dream about you
Every time I close my eyes
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

I always make my wishes
For same thing every time
If I live to be one hundred
Will I ever cross your mind

// A Promise To Keep //

I still talk to you in my sleep
I don't say much cause the hurt runs too deep
I gave you the moon and the stars to keep
but you gave them back to me

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep

I still lay on my side of the bed
I dance alone when the last bottle's spent
memories like a river runnin through my head
I'll have me an ocean before I'm dead

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep

I still whisper sweet words to you
and when I'm busy, or have nothing to do
I pray to god, that my words ring true
and that your words might reach me too

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep
I can't keep it...

My hearts in pieces so please understand
I've tried to jump, but I've nowhere to land
so give me your heart and I'll give you my hand
and I'll try as goddamn hard as I can

The hill I'm walkin up is gettin good and steep
but I'm still looking for a promise even I can't keep

// I'll Still Be There //

There never was a better love
To see the light of day
If only just to lift you up
And rise above the grey

It breaks my heart, but now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you Iâll still be there

My growing pain, my darkest days
I owe them all to you
For every break I've got you to thank
For always pulling me through

If it breaks your heart, at least you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you Iâll still be there

But if the world should let you down
And the sky should fall and never make a sound
And if it all disappear
I promise you I will be there

It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart
It breaks my heart, it breaks my heart

But now you know
That the broken binds are an open door
And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there

But if the world should let you down
If the sky should fall and never make a sound
Oh if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there

And if it all disappears
You have my word I will be there

And if it all disappears
I promise you I will be there

// What Did I Ever Come Here For? //

Iâve been gone for so long
And how I missed you
My heart was aching for home
And then one night as I lay down
Somewhere far from you
I dreamt that I heard you call my name
But my mind was playing games

I knew right then that Iâd return
To where I was before
And I was so tired of being away
That I just couldnât stay anymore
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?

I thought if I showed up in the night
In my best disguise
There at your doorway in your porch light
That you would look into my eyes
And you would realize who I am
Put your arms around me
You gonna love me so much more
Than you ever did before
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?

It wasnât too long before
I showed up at your door
Iâd been gone a thousand miles
I didnât know how much more I could stand
If I could stand at all
You said I looked like Iâd been through World War II
And my soul was worn right through
I thought you would read my mind
I thought youâd ask me to stay
You'd never turn me away like before
But you closed your door anyway
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?
Oh no no no no no
What did I ever come here for?

// Heart's Content //

Maybe you thought
I hung the moon
Maybe you thought 
We were johnny and june
Maybe we thought 
It was just us two
Maybe we spoke too soon 

We never lie
And we don't tell tales
We bite our tongues
And our fingernails
We fall in love
And we don't fall out
Maybe we speak too soon

Here's you and me 
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's been
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content

Oho oho oho oh yeah

Maybe we hurt
Who we love the most
Maybe it's all we can stand
Maybe we walk through the world as ghosts
Break my own heart before you can

Here's you and me 
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's been
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content

Ohoho yeah

Maybe we know how the story ends
Maybe it's not even about us
We both retreat to opposing sands
And the love lives on without us

One thing I know for sure is
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Here's you and me 
And in between
We draw a line
But we can't see
Where it's been
We scratch our heads
And race against
The heart's content

Oho oho oho
You and me
Oho oho oho
You and me
Oho oho oho
You and me 
Oho oho oho oh yeah

// Rise Again //

When I find the sweet hereafter
Put a blanket on my soul
Cast a shadow on my heart
Slide the chain across my door

Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again

I was longing for the wind
When the trees begin to sway
But I never grow my wings
No, I never fly away

For the anchor of my love
To which my heart is bound
Is the iron for the cage
That keeps me on the ground

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again

Now I'm dreaming to myself
With a tear behind my eye
For a shelter is my mind
In the quiet of the night

Ever turning all the seasons
Ever fading all the days
And if there ever was a reason
I just haven't found a way

To fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Fall like rain
Only to rise again

// In The Morrow //

I found myself today 
I took my cross up and walked away 
With amazing grace and open eyes 
Even though I'm born to lose my way 
Tomorrow comes on a hurricane 
When the weight of the world is on your mind 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 

No one sees it coming 
And no one walks when they should've been running 
Nothing hurts like knowing you tried 
And we can see how years can slip away 
In the cold dark nights and the long hard days 
But nothing aches quite like goodbye 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way 

In the morrow I'll be gone 
I gave it everything I had for so long 
Save your sorrow for your song 
Don't we always find a way to carry on 
Don't we always find a way to carry on

// Just Kids //

Were we just kids, just starting out
Didn't we know then love was about
Were we just fooling, playing around
Were we ever gonna get out of this town

Move to Seattle, stay up all night
That was when bedtime was our biggest fight

All in a moment, all in a sound
All in a day's work, we're tumbling down
Down by the old school, trash in the street
Searching the eyes of the strangers we meet
Asking will it get better?
Will we be alone?
Turning the wheels of our bicycles home

Over the rainbow, out in the snow
Learning to walk with the sand in our toes
Long to be tall, kissed when you fall
Hopping that someone will come when you call

You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
You call, you call, you call
