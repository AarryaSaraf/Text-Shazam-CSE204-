Album: WereGrowingUp

// Silver Cloud //

I walked on by the old school yard
As high as I envision
The years behind us and your decisions
Whatever it takes whatever you need
And I will be there for you
Last you heard is I adore you, well
And days go by
But that was yesterday
You want to still be friends
It doesn't work that way

I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud

If time wasn't lost
And the friends you forgot
That tried to be there for you
All you wanted was to be alone
And I can't win
It's over either way
Hey I know how this ends and I don't want to play

I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in and the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud

I watched our friendship sink
I held out my hand
You tore another chink
And I didn't understand
Thru all the white lies
Thru all the black lies
Hard to survive
As I held you up
Still your pride you rejected my crutch
I was floating on your silver cloud
When the storm came in
And the bottom fell out
Still I try I wonder why I can't figure it out
Floating on your silver cloud

// Tired //

Up tired with your blue eyes crying and youâre
Upset like youâre tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think youâll figure out
And even if youâve 

Lost your mind when youâre down and out
I donât know what youâre on about, but,
Youâll end up on your own again, hey.

Underlying, self-denying,
Hate when youâve been left behind.
The world is closing in on you.

Youâve been told a thousand times
To watch your back, you never know quite when
Or where.

Up tired with your blue eyes crying and youâre
Upset like youâre tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think youâll figure out
And even if youâve 

Lost your mind when youâre down and out
I donât know what youâre on about, but,
Youâll end up on your own again, hey.

Lost and low, I know, youâre okay.
I do believe Iâm saving you.

Maybe I donât want to be.
I do believe that it will be okay, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Underlying, self-denying,
Maybe youâve been left behind.
The world is closing in on you.

Youâve been told a thousand times
To watch your back, you never know quite where
Or when.

Up tired with your blue eyes crying and youâre
Upset like youâre tired of trying and
You gave it away; you think youâd figure out
And even if youâve 

Lost your mind when youâre down and out
I donât know what youâre on about, but,
Youâll end up on your own again, hey.
Yeah

Oh, everything will be okay.

// Somewhere Along The Way //

It must have been that day I stopped believing
It must have been that time I broke your door
Well I must have been that way before you met me
It must have been a thousand years or more

When you said no more dime store apologies from you
No more back yard rock stars howling at the moon
It's like the harder you try the bigger the debt you pay
I must have lost it...somewhere along the way

I never meant to cause you so much friction
I never saw how jaded I'd become
I never meant to harbor some addiction
I really wanna turn my head and run

When you said no more dime store apologies from you
No more back yard rock stars howling at the moon
It's like the harder you try the bigger the debt you pay
I must have lost it...somewhere along the way

// Last One To Know //

All along my face 
Something's not right 
Headin' down the lines 
I once believe in things unseen 

Till I was running out of 
Time is a virtue not many 
Of us have the luxury to enjoy 

Unless you think you're 
Free but nothing's guaranteed 
But death and taxes and 
(That should let me down)
I'm so far down today 
I'm so far down 
I'm so far down 

Here on my shoulder in stone 
I can never throw (it) away 
And I'm so angry yet so sad 
I remember when 
(The life ..)
You're so rad you're so rad 
I never amount to nothing but 
But ashes of faith 

(I'm not well)
I'm not brave enough to face the things 
That I know are wrong with my life 
So I blame you 

And you're the first one to go 
The first one to show 
The last one to know 
The last one to know
