// Breath Of Life //

I was looking for a breath of life
For little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

But I needed one more touch
Another taste of heavenly rush
And I believe, I believe it's so

[Not in the music video:]
And I needed one more touch
Another taste of divine rush
And I believe, I believe it's so

Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?
Whose side am I on? Whose side am I?

And the fever began to spread
From my heart down to my legs
But the room is so quiet

And although I wasn't losing my mind
It was a chorus so sublime
But the room is too quiet
(the fever)

I was looking for a breath of life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"
(fever)

[Not in the music video:]
To get a dream of life again
A little vision of the start and the end
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

[Choir:]
And the fever dream of life
And the chorus so sublime
And the room was too quiet

It's a harder way and it's come to claim her
And I always say, we should be together
I can't sleep alone, 'cause there's something in here
And if you are gone, I will not belong here
(belong, belong, belong)

And I started to hear it again
But this time it wasn't the end
And the room is so quiet

And my heart is a hollow plain
For the devil to dance again
But the room is too quiet

I was looking for a breath of life
A little touch of heavenly light
But all the choirs in my head sang, "No!"

// Call Me Cruella //

Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
She's born to be bad, so run for the hills
Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me the thrill

Who wants to be nice?
Who wants to be tame?
All of your good guys, they all seem the same

Original, criminal, dressed to kill
Just call me Cruella de Vil

Call me crazy, call me insane
But you're stuck in the past
And I'm ahead of the game

A life lived in penance
It just seems a waste
And the devil has much better taste

And I tried to be sweet
I tried to be kind
But I feel much better now that I'm
Out of my mind...

Well, there's always a line to the gates of hell
But I go right to the front 'cause I dress this well
Rip it up, leave it all in tatters
Beauty is the only thing that matters

The fabric of your little world is torn
Embrace the darkness
And be reborn

Cruella de Vil, Cruella de Vil
The fear on your face, it gives me the thrill

// Cornflake Girl //

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Givin' us the old heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go it's sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's goin on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love

This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
A-ha, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Where'd you put the keys, girl?

And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
Yeah

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
All this time, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?

// Delilah (Galantis Remix / Edit) //

Now the sun is up and I'm going blind
Another drink just to pass the time
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
Maybe not tonight

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

I can never let go
Never knew I was a dancer
I can never let go

'Cause I'm gonna be free and I'm gonna be fine
But maybe not tonight

And the bells are ringing out
And I'm calling for my mother
As I pull the pillars down

It's a different kind of danger
And my feet are spinning around
Never knew I was a dancer
'Till Delilah showed me how

I can never let go
I can never let go
Never knew I was a dancer
I can never let go

// Donkey Kosh //

With a donkey on my shoulder, 
And a jackal on my back,
I'll carry these, my children,
Keep them safe from attack

The donkey makes it hard to dance, the jackal sings too loud
The donkey cries when it's alone, and the jackal is too proud

Little donkey is getting restless,
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful,
Keeps biting at my nose

I would have a lover,
A husband, and a child
But the donkey is too jealous,
And the jackal is too wild

It's too wild

You ask me why I keep them, 
Why I love them so,
Why they get away with murder, 
As they grow and grow and grow, oh

I keep them cos I made them,
They come from in my loins
With each mistake I make
Creative, and torn apart

And when it's time to feed them,
Before they go to bed,
I give them my confessions,
Baked within their bread

Little donkey is getting restless,
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful,
Keeps biting at my nose

Little donkey is getting restless,
Getting heavier as it grows
And the jackal, spoiled and spiteful,
Keeps biting at my nose

// Halloween //

Well let me tell you a story, now
About a judge, a thief, and a wife and a clown
'Cause on this fine, fine day
One of them goes down

The judge said to the thief, "Boy, it's a fine day for justice,"
And the thief said to the judge, 
"Old man, it's a fine, fine day for love!"

The wife said to the clown,
"My dear, you gotta take the judge down!"
And the clown, the clown
He just smiled

As the clown stood, covered in the judge's blood, he cried, 
"Well I will be a fool no more
I will be a fool no more!"
As he turned and cartwheeled out the door

Now let me tell you something, 
The thief, the thief, and the wife
Well they left that day, left the...
Left the clown covered in the judge's blood alone

The clown frowned as he fell to the ground
It's a fine, fine day for love

It's a fine, fine, fine, fine day for love
A fine, fine day for fools
And I will be a fool no more
Oh, because of you

// Halo //

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
They didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Standing in the light of your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo
Halo
Halo
Halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Shining through my darkest nights
You're the only thing that I want
And I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I ain't ever gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Standing in the light of your halo
Pray it won't fade away

Halo
Halo
Halo
Halo

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Standing in the light of your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo, halo

// Haunted House //

My heart is like a haunted house
There's things in there that scratch about
They make their music in the night
And in the day they give me such a fright

My heart is like a haunted house
There's things in there that scream and shout
They make their music in the night
Wish I could find a way to let them out, oh

Do you remember winding your arm around my shoulder
As we wandered 'round the hill?
Now I'm in that fog forever
And full collaboration with the weather 'cause

I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not free at...

My heart is like a haunted house
There's things in there that scratch about
They make their music in the night
And in the day they give me such a fright

// I Love You All The Time //

I love you all the time
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, ah

I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time

I'm fueled up and high, I'm out with the guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

Ce soir câest le soir
Et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir
Tu viens, oh la la
I love you all the time

Tu ne rÃ©ponds pas
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Just say au revoir
Again me voilÃ 
I love you all the time

And I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I can tell you're going to take your love away

I can tell by that look in your eye
You're looking and all you see's another guy
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay
I would beg if I thought it would make you stay

Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi
Ah dites-moi pourquoi

// Jenny Of Oldstones (Game Of Thrones) //

High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones who had loved her the most

The ones who'd been gone for so very long
She couldn't remember their names
They spun her around on the damp old stones
Spun away all her sorrow and pain

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

They danced through the day
And into the night through the snow that swept through the hall
From winter to summer then winter again
Til the walls did crumble and fall

And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
And she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
Never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave

High in the halls of the kings who are gone
Jenny would dance with her ghosts
The ones she had lost and the ones she had found
And the ones
Who had loved her the most

// Just A Girl //

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

Oh, I've had it up to here

The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

'Cause I'm just a girl living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Well, I'm just a girl, oh, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison

Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here

// Light Of Love //

And I came to, walking on the train tracks
How did I get here? And how do I get back?
I've been up all night, let's stay awake
Push it further, you know I'll never break
At some point in the party I thought my heart was failing
You said, "Hey, you're ok. You seem to be still standing"
Flashes appeared at the corner of my eyes
I saw the stars and I didn't ask why
Heard the voices and caught my breath
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death

Well the feeling was always too much for me, it always came too strong
I wanted to get it right so badly that I always got it wrong
So you keep pushing on
You hope it won't be long
Till you could find the child you were
And find a way to get along

Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love

And oh my little sister, when the drugs were wearing off
I climbed into your bed and said, "I think I did too much"
In some ways that was simpler, being too fucked up to see
I didn't have to wake up to the world that was around me
And now we are awake and it seems too much to take
I want to close my eyes because I fear my heart will break
I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away

Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love
Don't go blindly into the dark
In every one of us shines the light of love

Na na na na na na na ah
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na ah
Na na na na na na

I want to look away
I want to look away
I want to look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away
I must not look away

// Moderation //

Want me to love you in moderation
Do I look moderate to you?
Sip it slowly and pay attention
I just have to see it through
You got me looking for validation
Passion's new
Want me to love you in moderation
Well, who do you think you're talking to?

Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation (Ooh)

I've never made it with moderation
No, I've never understood
All the feeling was all or nothing
And I took everything I could
Can't hold it back, I can't take the tension
Oh, I'm trying to be good
Want me to love you in moderation
Well, don't you know, I wish I could

Then bow your head in the house of God
And little girl, who do you think you are?
You think you need it, you think you want love
You wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
Moderation
Moderation
Moderation

Girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
Can't hold it in (Can't hold it in)
And girl, you better learn (I just can't win)
And I just can't win (Can't hold it in)
'Cause I don't see the worth (I just can't win)
I don't see the worth
And I'm still tryna figure out if it
Always, always, always has to hurt
(Ah...)

You want love

// My Best Dress //

When your life is over I won't be sad or bluer
I'll put on my fancy hat, lie down next to you
I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress

You look so angry when you sleep, your face a troubled frown
So I will smooth your furrowed brow as I lay in the ground
I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
I'll hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress

And as the mourners pass me, I will smile and wave
Thank them for their sympathy and tell them I'll be brave
But once the wake is over, and I'm drunk and feeling fine
I'll go out there and find me another boy to pass the time

As we're dancing cheek to cheek and the lights are laid low
I'll request this song for you, laying in the ground below
Once the song is over, it's time to go to bed
I'll leave him on the dance floor and return to you instead

I'll kiss you once for life; I'll kiss you twice for death
I'll hold you close for comfort, wearing my best dress

// Over The Love //

Ever since I was a child
I've turned it over in my mind
I sang by that piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried

And I don't wanna see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come, come

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of you

On this champagne, drunken hope
Against the current, all alone
Everybody, see, I love him

'Cause it's the feeling that you get
When the afternoon is set
On a bridge into the city

I don't wanna see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry

'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it, I'll get around it
'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I'll sing from that piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you

Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of you

Cry and cry and cry and
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
Over the love of you
Cry and cry and cry and cry

(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)

(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)
(I can see the green light)
(I can see it in your eyes)

I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes

I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes

// Postcards From Italy //

The times we had
Oh when the wind would blow with rain and snow
Were not all bad
We put our feet just where they had, had to go
Never to go

The shattered soul
Following close but nearly twice as slow
In my good times
There were always golden rocks to throw
At those who admit defeat too late
Those were our times, those were our times

And I will love to see that day
That day was mine
When she will marry me outside by the willow trees
And play the songs we made
They made me so
And I would love to see that day
Her day was mine

// Take Care //

Know youâve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, hereâs what Iâll do
Iâll take care of you
Cause Iâve loved and Iâve lost

Iâve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didnât change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please donât be so ashamed
Iâve had mine, youâve had yours, we both know
We know, they donât get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you canât sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didnât break
Iâll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just donât know
Trying to run from that, say youâre done with that
On your face girl, it just donât show
When youâre ready, just say youâre ready
When all the baggage just ainât as heavy
And the parties over, just donât forget me
Weâll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You wonât ever have to worry,
You wonât ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

Cause if you let me, hereâs what Iâll do
Iâll take care of you
Cause Iâve loved and Iâve lost

Itâs my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Canât deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you donât say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youâre following your heart
Cause your mind donât control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, donât be so ashamed
Iâve had mine, youâve had yours, we both know
We know

Know youâve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, hereâs what Iâll do
Iâll take care of you
Cause Iâve loved and Iâve lost

I've loved and I've lost [3x]

// Tantalus //

It's a black lake that I'm standing in
It's a shallow pool and I cannot drink or swim
And the fruit trees are draping up above
I can see them but I cannot ever touch

In my heart in my chest like a bomb in a bag
And it's always on the edge of going off
But then you give me just enough

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't even know what you've done
You don't even know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
Oh it was never mine
To keep me tantalized

Do you mean to withhold what I hunger for
Did you just forget and don't think of me at all
And in the garden of the world
I could have my fill
I could rage and ransack, but something holds me still

In my heart in my chest like a bomb in a bag
And it's always on the edge of going off
But then you give me just enough

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
Oh it was never mine
You keep me tantalized

What you want from me
Maybe you don't even know
How you keep me tantalized
Every day, every night
Are you oblivious to my oblivion
You don't know what you've done
You don't know what you've done
You keep me dangling like that fruit upon a vine
It was never mine
You keep me tantalized

// Throwing Bricks //

I built a man made out of bricks
And lived inside his chest
I beat my head against the wall
To make a heartbeat in his breast
I smashed my fists against his ribs
To suck the air inside
And swing by swing and blow by blow
I brought that man to life

I built a man and cut his skin
And lived inside his heart
I pumped it with my fingertips
And loved it from the start
And with every beat I gave it
A heartbeat of my own
And filed his veins with the blood I had
'Till his blood, 'till his blood
'Till his blood was my own

I would build you up
But we're not made of the same stuff
And even though I knocked you down
You're so much stronger than me

Well I would build you right up
But we're not made of the same stuff
And even though I knocked you down
You're so much stronger than me

// Tiny Dancer //

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad

Piano man he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on she sings the songs
The words she knows the tune she hums

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band
Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand

But oh how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

// Where Are Ü Now //

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most

When you broke down, I didn't leave ya
I stayed by your side
So where are you now when I need ya?
I need you the most?

I gave you attention when nobody else was playin'
I gave the shirt off my back what you sayin'
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh lord

Where are you now when I need ya?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the most
(When we broke down, I didn't leave ya)
I stayed by your side
So where are you now when I need ya?
I need you the most

I gave you my heart when said yours was broken.
I gave you the keys when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See I gave you faith turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned into moping
Tell me 

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now?
(Where are you now that I need ya?)
Couldn't find you anywhere
(When you broke down I didn't leave ya)
I was by your side
(When you broke down I didn't leave ya)
Where are you now?

(I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need the most)
I was by your side
Where are you now?
I was by your side
Where are you now?
(I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, I need the most)

Where are you now that I need ya?

// Wish That You Were Here //

I've tried to leave it all behind me
But I woke up and there they were beside me
And I don't believe it but I guess it's true
Some feelings, they can travel too
Oh there it is again, sitting on my chest
Makes it hard to catch my breath
I scramble for the light of change

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

And if I stay home, I don't know
There'll be so much that I'll have to let go
You're disappearing all the time
But I still see you in the light
For you, the shadows fight
And it's beautiful but there's that tug in the sight
I must stop time traveling, you're always on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

We all need something watching over us
Be it the falcons, the clouds or the cross
And then the sea swept in and left us all speechless
Speechless

And I never minded being on my own
Then something broke in me and I wanted to go home
To be where you are
But even closer to you, you seem so very far
And now I'm reaching out with every note I sing
And I hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
Wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
Tells you that I miss you and I wish that you were here

Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
Wish that you were here
I wish that you...

// Ye Old Hope / Tear Out My Tongue //

Old hope
Got stuck in your throat
Wound its way around your neck
And caused you to choke
Old hope
Made of rope
That held you tight when the chair legs broke

When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed
When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed

Save my blushes for the grave
No shy glance, no coy restraint
And I won't hang my head
And I won't repent
Won't face the wall and count to ten
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

Well they tore you down
And they tore out your tongue
And they made you kneel
For all the things that you'd done
But you wouldn't cry
And you wouldn't beg
You just grinned
And tore out your teeth instead

When they found you hanging in the wood
You said at least now I don't have to be kind or good
I'll be cruel and I'll be obscene
Tear out my tongue
Cause I've been redeemed

I don't have to sit down and behave
Cause my darling I've been saved
