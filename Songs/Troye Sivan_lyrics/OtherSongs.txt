// 1999 //

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, All That
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days, it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee, hee)
Never under pressure, oh
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"

Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night
Ah, yeah

I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Ah, yeah

Back to 1999
I know those days are over, but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my e-e-eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back

I just wanna go back (Yeah), back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go

Back to where we came from (Came from)
Playin' air guitar on the roof (Ah)
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
I just wanna go back, back to 1999 (Go back)
Go back, yeah, yeah
I just wanna go back, yeah, back to 1999
Take me back to '99 (Yeah)

// Angel Baby //

I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics
Something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret
And baby I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever (Ooh, forever)
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby (You're my angel, baby)
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

// Better Now //

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benz oh
You're not even speaking to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were looking forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I just keep on looking back on better days

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

I promise
I swear to you I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (of my life, of my life...)

You probably think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Ooh-ooh...

// Blue Moon //

In my free, in my wild.
In my dark, oh we started.
Started to doubt, doubt this fire.
Lighting up our lives, and it kept me up at night.
Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Which one of us, went and fucked up?
You and me... I guess it was me.
Don't know a good thing when
it's right in front of me cause I'm so numb.
What have I become?
Oh, cause crash and burn is all I know.
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose my blue...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be, 
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose,
My blue moon

// could cry just thinkin about you (Full Version) //

We wrote a life all by ourselves
Wish I could put it back on the shelf
But there's a dazzling wave that keeps me at bay with you, my love
I ride this one all by myself

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
Yeah, I guess I'm 'bout to find out

We took a trip and made the best
We laughed and played, then laid to rest
But life's a blackening way of drifting us further than we are, oh yeah
And now we're knee-deep in this mess

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out

// Easy (Remix) //

Woo!

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, leave me

I'm not a saint so just give me the blame
I know what I want and it gets in my way
I know I'm not easy, darlin'
(I'm kinda a freak, my darlin')
When you see me out
I hope the taste in your mouth
Is still as sweet as I wish it could be
Believe me, darlin'
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

We knew what was under the surface
And lived like it wouldn't hurt us
But it hurt us

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

He made it easy
Please don't leave me
He made it easy
Please don't leave me

// For Them //

Yesterday I heard the news
That 4 million Russian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they trust
Now their cold and lonely lives are hopeless

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Yesterday I read the news
That 20 million Asian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they love
They've been beaten down so hard they can't get up

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair?

Children of the world
People say they care, well they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Life is beautiful for some
Life is beautiful for us
Life isn't beautiful for them
Maybe life can be beautiful again for them

// Hands To Myself / Sorry Medley //

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, Iâm trying, I'm trying, Iâm trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, Iâm trying, I'm trying, Iâm trying

Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause Iâm missing more than just your body. Hey!
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

Sorry, yeah!
So sorry

My doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause Iâm missing more than just your body. Hey!
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 

Sorry, yeah!
So sorry
I'm sorry

Yeah I know, I know, that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Can't keep my hands to myself

// Happy Little Pill (Casper Zazz Remix) //

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not whole
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And
My happy little pill

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring color to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

// i'm so tired... //

[Lauv:]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I-I, oh I... yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think they make anything that strong so I hold on
I-I, oh I... yeah

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Troye Sivan:]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on
I-I, oh I...
Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I-I, oh I... yeah

[Lauv & Troye Sivan:]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home

So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love songs

Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home

Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs (I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

// Love Me Wrong //

Oh, you love me
You put me to bed
Yeah, you love me
Dress me to the nines
Yeah, you love me
You tell me I'm special, so special
I know you love me
'Cause you want the best

But you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong

Oh, you love me
You lose sleep over me
I know you love me
'Cause I'm there in your wallet
And your locket
I heard you talk about me in the kitchen
And you didn't know I was listening
But I was there
Sitting on the stairs
Talk about me in the kitchen
And you didn't know I was listening
But I was there
And that isn't fair

Wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
Yeah you love me wrong
You love me wrong

I'll never be
How you remember me
So I'd rather be
In your memory
No, I'll never be
How you remember me
So I'd rather be
In your memory

// Revelation //

You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know

It's a revelation
There's no hell in what I found
No kingdom shell
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

'Til the end
It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Ever I roam

// Sea Of Love //

Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

Do you remember when we met?
That's the time I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

Do you remember when we met?
That's the time I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you how much
I love you ooh oh a ooh

I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you...

// Somebody To Love //

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard
Every day of my life
I work til' I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Til' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (somebody)
Find me somebody to love (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

// Strawberries & Cigarettes //

Remember when we first met?
You said "light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mom and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you
You
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

Headlights, on me (And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

// The 2012 Song //

One Direction took over the world,
All the boys and Harry's curly curls.
And Obama's back, I guess he's a hit,
Thank you, US, cause Mitt Romney's a shit.
Gangnam Style took over the tubes,
The London olympics were pretty huge.
Drake told people You Only Live Once,
Hashtag YOLO son.
Carly Jepsen said call me maybe,
And Justin said, that's not myâ¦

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

Kony please stop acting like a prick,
The producer of that played with hisâ¦
Cole Sprouse joined tumblr, we said hello,
But now he's just somebody that we used to know.
Somebody, somebody.
That dude Felix, jumped from the sky,
Everyone thought, âhe's gonna die.â
Swag, swag, swag on you.
Personally, I started vlogging too!

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

The world ended, we all got owned,
Oh wait shit sorry, that was postponed.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

// The 2013 Song //

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Miley went on twerked on stage
Made the whole world fill with rage
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde

Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out Mr. Tom Daley!
The world's realising it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys

What? I like boys. Have you seen their butts? Exactly!

Robin Thicke went to number 1
Even though his song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes!

Everybody said that she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray
But here we are asking What The Fox Say?

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

The US Government needed a break
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes

The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss
Rest in peace, Nelson Mandela
To you, Madiba, we're indebted forever

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Now do the Harlem Shake

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

// The Fault In Our Stars //

The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm OK

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

You lost
A part of your existence
In the war against yourself

Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

[3x]
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

With you

// There For You //

I woke up pissed off today,
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
But let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you?
I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you

Running, running just to keep my hands on you
Running, running just to keep my hands on you
So, I'm running, running just to keep my hands on you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

// Trouble //

Accidental lover, what you do with all my common sense?
You came in undercover when I didn't even want a friend

I'm tired of living like I'm dying
But now I can find the silver lining like before
Yeah, like before
You got a funny sense of timing
Showed up on the night that I stopped trying for something more
For something more

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

Tandem lover, what I tell you is in confidence
Laying here together makes me wanna take a second chance

My room is spinning when I'm sober
So somebody wake me in October
Oh my God
You got a funny sense of knowing
I don't know where all this is going
But don't stop

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I just move along all by myself?

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I, I, I

But I'm like, "Oh shit, God, I think we're in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And oh baby, you're kinda driving me crazy
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

// Wait //

Could've broken me like glass in an emergency
It's a giving in, where do I begin?
Pastel skies, I don't know why
I hate Florida sometimes
Is it take and take?
Or is it my mistake?

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

In the sand you dig your heels, on who I am and what is real
Only you and me, and all we're going to be

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

// We're My OTP //

Valentine's Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan fic in the middle of the night
'Cause this will bring us closer, right?

"You've never met them," the peasant cried
Shut the fuck up bitch! Do you wanna die?!
And I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a GIF

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction?
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels right where it hurts!

I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella... almost.

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh

OTP,
We're my OTP,
(We're my OTP baby!)
Baby you and me
(OTP, OTP)
We'd be so sexy, oh

[Spoken:]
No, literally, the only thing that's stopping us from getting married is the fact that we haven't "met yet".

// WILD (Remix) //

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

Weâre alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild 

You're driving me wild, wild, wild

// You //

(Ooh, girl, all I see is you)
Is you, is you, I do

How could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad 'cause you never told me why
Still I can't seem to say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (Yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do
But ooh, yeah
No I haven't moved on but trust me I've tried (Yeah)
If I give you a call don't hang up the line (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do

I do

I'm good at overthinking, but I haven't even got this far
All I know is that my mind is in the back seat of your Corvette car
You got me at my baddest and you got me 'round your fingertip
Should be fed up with your bullshit, but everything about you, no, I can't resist

How could you ever leave me without a chance to try?
How can I be sorry if I don't know the crime?
I should be mad that you never told me why
Still I can't seem to say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (Yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (Yeah)
When the jealousy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do
But ooh, yeah
No I haven't moved on but trust me I've tried (Yeah)
If I give you a call don't hang up the line (Yeah)
When the jealousy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do

Is you, oh, you
Is you, is you, I do

I see your face in every stranger, everywhere I go (Everywhere I go)
I hear your voice and conversations, every word you spoke (Every words you spoke)
Nearly blocked you on my phone about a thousand times
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye
(Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
Yeah, I know I should say goodbye

Ooh, yeah
When I try to fall back, I fall back to you (Yeah)
When I talk to my friends I talk about you (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do
But ooh, yeah
No I haven't moved on but trust me I've tried (Yeah)
If I give you a call don't hang up the line (Yeah)
When the Hennessy's strong, all I see is you
Is you, is you, I do

// You Know What I Need //

When we only cared about the fall
It was the way to know that we were getting out
Too early to stay worried about us all
Before we knew what we were both about

And now w'ere stuck and holding
Everything is frozen
We're fake and safe and sound
And when I can't keep picking up each time you call
If everything I say just isn't sound

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

I'm learning, baby, if we keep on burning
No, I can't leave you, the world will keep on turning
But I'm thinking lately what's so concerning
Soon as I leave you, I just keep on hurting

And once we're off the tracks
It falls apart too fast
And we've been scared for too long
Never really lasts
Once I get to thinking, it all keeps coming back, yeah

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

Alright, baby, let's not lie, you know you don't cry for me
Why not?
Cryin' out in the dead of night, baby don't you lie to me
My god
Alright, baby, let's not lie, you know you don't die for me
Be honest, just try to be honest
Because

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it (I don't want it)
You're all that I want (You're all that I want)
You're all that I need (You're all that I need)
And if it hurts me then, I don't want it

Before we run out of time, we gotta get it tonight
Before we leave it behind, we gotta get it alright
It's then after the party that we say our goodbyes
Got my hands on your body and it's feeling alright
But I don't want it
