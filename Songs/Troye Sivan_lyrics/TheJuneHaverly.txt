Album: TheJuneHaverly

// The June Haverly //

June Haverly,
You always get your way,
But June Haverly,
Not today, no not today

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
You always got your way,
But not today, no not today
No not today

June Haverly,
You're not to blame,
No not to blame
And June Haverly,
Don't be ashamed,
For all the pain

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?

// She's 22 //

Sheâs 22, and sheâs loving you
and youâll never know how it makes me blue,
does she make you happy?

Iâm holding on, to a thing thatâs wrong
cause we donât belong,
you like my songs and it makes me happy
does she make you happy?

You can throw away, every word I say

Iâm standing still, on this hidden hill,
and Iâm looking around for the right way down,
to your distant valley,
your flowers grow, in the frozen snow and Iâd like to know is it all a show,
are you really happy? [x2]

Cause you can throw away, every word I say
You just throw away

// Make You Love Me //

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there
Only the Lord knows why it's not there

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

I can't make you love me, yeah
I can't make you love me 
(I can't make you love me)

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
(You just wave goodbye)
