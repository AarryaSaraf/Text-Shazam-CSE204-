Album: Weakness

// Just Like Love //

Why are we here, no one knows
Killin' and lovin' and wearin' clothes
Talkin' and yellin' and tradin' blows
And walkin' around like fools

Who am I, I'm like you
Who are you, you are what you do
Do me wrong and you're wrong too
And that's the Golden Rule

Ain't it just like love
To double cross you again
Get right under your skin
Do you in

Money and war, it's insane
Acting like the devil with God's name
But us and them, we're both the same
And we're all left to suffer

So dust to dust and bread to bread
Sin and pain and loneliness
Life is real and so is death
And we're all born blood brothers

Ain't it just like love
To double cross you again
Get right under your skin
Do you in

// Paper Cowboy //

Well you're nothing but a paper cowboy
Made out of glue and old news
And all your bravado and your drug-dealing ways
That only gives us the blues

Well you're nothing but a paper cowboy
Made out of glue and old news
And all your bravado and your drug-dealing ways
Well that only gives us the blues

You're always out talking a good game
With your cronies, your clowns, and your dogs
All of the things that you say you'll do
Well a million-to-one says you won't

So lay down your guns
They were never loaded anyhow
With your high-dollar boots
And your trash-talking mouth
This town has no use for you now

When everyone gets on to your tricks
Where in the hell are you gonna go?
Can't say that you've got nothing to prove
Baby, when you've got nothing show

Because you're nothing but a paper cowboy
So fade away like a good cowboy should
With your pony, the reigns, hell on the plains
And you can tell them you was misunderstood

So lay down your guns
They were never loaded anyhow
With your high-dollar boots
And your trash-talking mouth
Oh this town has no use for you now
Said this town has no use for you now

// Good Luck (For Ben Eyestone) //

Once I had a few words left to say
I thought I'd save them for a rainy day
But the clouds are in my mind once again
So long, my friend

We fought on the same side of the line
But the fight and the years were never kind
And we'll never be that green or blue again
So long, my friend

Chasing dreams down the hall
Oh it's a strange life after all
Maybe you'll get one
Before it's done

The sky is filled with UFOs and stars
I hope that you can see 'em where you are
And if you think about me now and then
So long, my friend

Chasing dreams down the hall
Oh it's a strange life after all
Maybe you'll get one
Before it's done

Shoulda known we'd go our separate ways
But I hope the road is treating you okay
When you get back home, or until then
So long, my friend

And if you think about me now and then
So long, my friend
