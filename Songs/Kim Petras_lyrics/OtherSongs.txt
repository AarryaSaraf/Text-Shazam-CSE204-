// 105 //

105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
359, had seven shots
Uber driver just kicked us out
Sun is up but we won't stop
100 miles an hour, going nowhere

On the road now, pull my phone out
I just met these girls, these my hoes now
Not gonna slow now, on a roll now
Miley dancing with me, we on the floor now
We so high now, it 'bout 5 now
At this point I might be high enough to drive now
Having fun now, tipping wines out
It's getting lit, freaky side about to come out

Couldn't be lit if you remember it in the morning
When you're looking like this, know you're gonna get into something

105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
359, had seven shots
Uber driver just kicked us out
Sun is up but we won't stop
100 miles an hour, going nowhere

Tell me who's this in the bed right now?
Tell me how did I get here right now? Ah
Wait until my best friend find out
We wasn't talking but he used this, ah
I'm out here looking like the lotto, yeah
Feeling like a fucking model, yeah
I ain't worried 'bout tomorrow, yeah
Drinking straight out of the bottle

Couldn't be lit if you remember it in the morning
When you're looking like this, know you're gonna get into something

105 on a Rolex watch
2am, got the plug on lock
Don't wait up, we stayin' up
100 miles an hour, going nowhere
359, had seven shots
Uber driver just kicked us out
Sun is up but we won't stop
100 miles an hour, going nowhere

// Alone //

// Coconuts //

My coconuts, you can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
My coconuts, watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down, bounce up and down)

Cocoa, I tan in lotion
Sunsets over the ocean
Look up, hot air balloons
All good things come in twos
Work them out at the gym
Dive in and take a swim
Everybody loves the twins
Everybody loves the twins

So juicy and so ripe
You wouldn't believe
I give 'em different names
Mary Kate and Ashley
They ask me what's my size
Just give 'em a squeeze
Strawberry, mango, lime
Don't compare to these

My coconuts, you can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
My coconuts, watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down, bounce up and down)

Cocoalicious
Dripping down your face
So delicious
Bet you want a taste
My coconuts, you can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)

Ooh la la la la la
Whipped cream, cherry on top
Ice cream, sweet cocoa puff
Tight jeans, tropical pop
Ooh ma, ma-ma, give me a
PiÃ±a Colada-da-da
Look at these margarit-ta-tas
Look at these margarit-ta-tas

So juicy and so ripe
You wouldn't believe (believe)
I give 'em different names
Cartier and Tiffany
I know you want a bite
Get your face in these (in these)
I see 'em in your eyes
So meet the double D's

My coconuts, you can put 'em in your mouth
(Right now, right now, right now, right now)
My coconuts, watch 'em bounce up and down
(Bounce up and down, bounce up and down)

Everything with us is ok
I watched it all fade away
Fade away, I watched him fade away

Tell me how I got you

// Feel It //

This night, this beauty
The stars around me
Nothing more I could say
It's you and me
And no one else here
Nothing will stay the same

Because you were never here, never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you see I really want to stay with you
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something?
It's there, it's there, it's there

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush

Na-na na na na na...

I felt so lonely
Without you only
Now I'm back in your arms
Stay tonight
I'll do what you like
I will do you no harm

Because you're never here or never there
Baby we can go really anywhere
Can you tell I really want you to stay with me
Which I do
You cannot leave you cannot go
Stop, look in my eyes and take it slow
Can you feel there's something
It's there, it's there, it's there

Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
Don't leave me here, don't leave me here
Feel it, feel it
Can you feel it there, can you feel it there?
In the air

There's something in the air
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel it
One day is not enough
I'm asking you, can you feel it?
I can feel it, feel the rush
Feel the touch
Wait up 'til dawn and see those thoughts
I'm asking you
Wish you can stay the night
I'm wanting you to feel it
I can feel it, feel it, feel

Na-na na na na na....

// If Jesus Was A Rockstar //

If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him

Baby all I really need is something to believe
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
I need someone who can teach me to get on my knees
Hell yeah (Yeah)
But if he look like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really really want you to know that

If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
I might meet him in the bathroom
Hell yeah (Hell yeah)
We might pop one, a red or blue
Hell yeah
But if he look like Kurt Cobain (I might)
If he drank the pain away (I might)
And if you think I can't be saved (that's right)
I really really want you to know that

If Jesus was a rockstar
Living like a party everyday
And diving off the stage
If you give it to a popstar
That night I'd wanna be just like him
If Jesus was a rockstar
Throwing daddy's money all around
While he was getting down
So they kicked him out of the bar
That night I'd wanna be just like him

(A rockstar)
Just like him

// Money Got Her Hot //

I got my lipstick on
Ready to party
I look around
And the club is full of hotties
You see this guy there
They say that he's got money
I hear his Rolex tick and suddenly he got me, got me

You see me party party
Take me on a Safari
Mink, Gorilla, Chinchilla, Whatever
Get it for me
Stop staring old guys
I'm way too stylish
I'm wanting Balenciaga
Do not need Viagra, holla

Money got her hot
Money got her hot
Money, money got her what?
Money, money got her hot, oh!

Money got her hot
Money got her hot
Money, money got her what?
Money, money got her hot, oh!

I'll be your Marilyn
She is your Jackie
Don't need her anyways
If you can push up on me
You're such a Rockefeller
I hear kaching kaching
Don't need no Louis V
If I can get some Bling Bling

You'll be my Santa Clause
I'll be your chimney
You can come in and out
Just leave a present for me
You're looking at my goodies
I'm looking at your wallet
I see your money money
Can't you see I want it want it

Oh baby you can see no blood on my Louboutin soles
No honey you can see no blood on my Louboutin soles, no

I'll be your playmate
You'll be my Heffner
Give me some Dolce
We can do what-so-ever
Get me a new bikini
Driving in your Lamborghini
Paris would be jealous
If she could just see me see me

Money got her hot

Take me to Paris
Sur les Champs-ÃlysÃ©es
Get me some new heels
Or we both are passÃ©
If you're not as rich as Trump
You won't ever touch my hump
Look around so many girls
Wanting you to touch their junk
All the boys at the bar
Waitin' to give me a drink
Paralyzed by the money
Do not stop to blink blink
You say that I'm a hoe
But I might say I'm not
What the hell can I do
If the money got me so hot

Oh baby you can see no blood on my Louboutin soles
No honey you can see no blood on my Louboutin soles, no...

// One Piece Of Tape //

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Hey, brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Day, brand new day

There is no easy way
'cause every way is hard
There is no imitation of everybody's heart
There are no limits, and no boundaries
So why you want to tell me my love is a disease

One million voices
Come only once
And every little step
Comes the rolling stone

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day

Don't try to tell me secrets
So you can hear mine
It is my life, I'm gonna live it right
Time is chasing me and every one of us
And when the clock stops tickin'
Then I can hear your heart

Forget your darkest hour and all your pain
'Cause I can see the sun after the rain

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Hey, brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Day, brand new day

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay
It's one step closer to the start
Of a brand new day
Day, day, day, ya-aye
Of a brand new day

If one piece of tape could change the world
Then the world would be okay

// Reminds Me //

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

I'm stuck, fucked up, fuck love
I'm off, can't sleep, can't think
Because my heart is broke
You left me cold, you left the pain
You took my soul, damn

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger
Man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over
I could have you in another life

I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

Cut off my bitches, yeah, won't return no calls, yeah
If I woulda listened, we would still be on, yeah
One of my exes came to break me off, yeah
I mean to fuck, but I ain't nut at all, no
Whole time you were on my mind, baby
I swear you got me fuckin' love-crazy
Remember when I said nothing phased me
Well that was till I lost my baby, yeah

But I don't wanna cry
Got my finger on the trigger
Man, I'm thinking 'bout a homicide
I feel like I can die
Maybe if it was all over
I could have you in another life

(Reminds me of you)
I can't play that song 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't watch that show 'cause it reminds me of you
I can't even go there, it reminds me of you
I don't wanna do that, it reminds me of you
Cut off all my friends 'cause they remind me of you
I can't drink again 'cause I'm reminded of you
I don't wanna do shit that reminds me of you
Everything and everywhere reminds me of you

// Running Up That Hill //

It doesn't hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

You don't want to hurt me (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)
Tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (E-yo)
Say, if I only could, ooh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)

Oh, come on, baby (Ye-yeah)
Oh, come on, darling (E-yo)
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Yeah, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems
Yeah, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Yeah, if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, be running up that road
If I only could, be running up that road

(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)
(Shut up, scream, don't stop, leave)

I, I'm so tired of sitting in the backseat
I wanna drive, I wanna drive
I, I want control, I want it all, yeah
I decide to side, decide to side

I'm in the proposition, that means that I'm on top
So when I talk, you listen, no, don't you dig it up
I want you on all fours, I got a Gaultier leash
I got a red Ferrari, I'm all alone and naughty
I live up in the mountains, that's where they keep the freaks
I need a Michelangelo, I'm like a God in Greece

Don't come to my place
Unless you're ready
Turn around, babe, turn around, babe
Don't come up late
Unless you're ready to meet your faith, to meet your faith

(Shut up) Do as I say, do as I say
(Scream) Do it my way, do it my way
(Don't stop) Do as I say, do as I say

// Supersonic //

Ah ah eh
Ah ah eh
Ah ah eh

Spotlight on me
I'm gonna get where I wanna go tonight
(Tonight, tonight, yeah)
Taking your word
Excitement mixed with energy and light
(Uhh ow ow)
It's like a bubble that's about to pop
The energy, it's coming from inside
(Inside, baby)
It's like a secret that you can't explore
You're gonna keep on trying all your life
(Life)

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

It keeps you out
[?]
There's no doubt
Attention
It pushed you to the limit and beyond
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
It is stuck inside your mind
Your body
Everywhere else you do not know
(How can you know, know, know)
If you are trying to push it away
It's gonna stay
A life long

It is craving for attention
And it didn't come to play
If you haven't recognized
That baby it is not a game
If you hit the time now
Then you gonna make a hit
If you got that supersonic
Then it's never gonna quit

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic

Is electronic so hypnotic
Don't try to get rid of it
Come out is automatic
Keeping your whole brain in synch
Automatic, so pathetic
[?]
Keeping you all day ecstatic
Supersonic can't control

It is something too enormous to explain
Super, supersonic
And tonight electronic is insane
Super, supersonic
Who would I be with the lights that you can't see
Super, supersonic
Stuck inside your mind in melody
Super, supersonic....

// Time //

The time is passing fast and there is
No way to get it back because it's
High speed, it goes around and doesn't

Even do a sound and there is
No time, catch a breath and when it
When it's gone it's lost in space and there is
Nothing to make me stop
I wanna getting love

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

We thought we last forever but
Pushing set and never rest and there is
Anger for everything
And there is no chance to win
Into the way, all the place
Have we really lost a stance?
What's right and what is wrong?
Now all we've done is on

And change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head
Watch out and change your luck
It's falling, you were up
There was no turning back
It chases, watch your head

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

I was going when on
And running on and on
And it will never stop
I wish will never stop
There's no time to breathe
Go back and fall asleep
It's running on and on
Time
(Time)

Even if time
Tears us apart
We have a life, never knew we would
And there'll be a place
So we're lost in space
Where we will meet and there is no time to chase
All my bout
All of the things
We should have done but we didn't have the time
Have time, have time

Running, running on and on, it's running on and on
And it will never stop, it will never stop
The time, more time, more time, more time
Oh, oh
