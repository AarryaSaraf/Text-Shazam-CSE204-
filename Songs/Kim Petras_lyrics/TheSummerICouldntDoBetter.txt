// Hills //

[Kim Petras:]
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

I been out West in LA and shit
All my exes want attention, I ain't payin' it
I ain't spent a thing off my latest check
Funny thing we ain't even in a relationship
Hallucinogenic
Don't know how long I been trippin'
But I'm sippin' and I'm kickin' it with you
It's been a lot of fun
Puffin', puffin', passin'
We made love, we made it happen
We got passion
We did things you probably hadn't even thought of yet

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

[Baby E:]
I been out West in LA and shit
Smoking things, chasing dreams on some player shit
Thinking I might buy a chain with my latest flip
You just gotta run your feet, I'm running through the check
Player hating on me 'cause she told me she was single
But you see just how I'm rocking and you couldn't really blame him
We was puffin', puffin', passin', we was fuckin', we was laughin'
We had passion
We was doing things that you couldn't even imagine, yeah

Rollin' through the hills on drugs
Smoked out in the back of a big black truck
Poppin' pills in love
Spending days in a haze and it feels so good

[Kim Petras:]
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

You can hit me, you can hit me, yeah you know where I'm at
(Where I'm at, where I'm at, I gotcha)
And I wanna, and I wanna make sure you won't forget
(Won't forget, won't forget, I gotcha)
Till the morning, till the morning every time that we hang
(That we hang, that we hang, I gotcha)
Pass it over, pass it over, do it over again, do it over again
Do it over again!

If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)
Pass it in the backseat just for thrills
(I gotcha, yeah)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
Up, down, up, down
(Can we do it again?)
If you wanna pop one in the hills
(I gotcha)

// Hillside Boys //

Ooh

My silhouette is in the frame of your shades again
And your cigarette's facing its final breath
Just once or twice is too many times when you know the end

And you'll only stay until our tear lines match
Oh, it's over in your, in your Range Rover
And I don't, don't know why I want ya
But you look so pretty when you're breaking me, yeah

// Faded //

[Kim Petras:]
They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'

Why they always want my time
Yeah like we can rewind
And I ain't gonna lie
I'm faded out my mind
Faded every night
I can touch the sky
I be too faded to drive
Every night I wanna fly
Cause it's all about us
Spend some money live it up
They never saw when it was rough
Drop the top and roll the windows up

They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'

Stay faded every night
Faded everyday
That's the only way
That's the only way
In and out of different places
But I can't see their faces
They wanna love me cause I'm famous
Can't nobody blame us, no
And this is all about us
Spend some money, live it up
They never saw when it was rough
Drop the top and roll the windows up

They wanna squeeze you when you're warm
When it's cold they ain't around
They crowd around you when you up
Then disappear when you get stuck

I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded every nigh-high-ight
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded, I ain't ly-high-in'
I stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Stay faded every nigh-igh-igh-ight
Faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'
Stay faded, I ain't ly-y-y-y-y-in'

[lil aaron:]
Yeah, I stay faded only smoking A-graded
Everybody fake as fuck so I been self medicatin'
I'm the greatest that there was and still the most underrated
That shit ain't up for discussion or debatin'
Still I gotta get fucked up to have a good time
If there's something in my cup then it's a good night
I'm hittin' up the plug, tell 'em I'ma double up
I'ma need a couple blunts, make 'em double-stuffed

// Heart To Break //

Any time, that you like
Gonna give you my heart to break
Angel eyes, tell me lies
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control?
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break

I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
That's why I give you my heart to break

Butterflies, every time
Gonna give you my heart to break
Devilish, every kiss
Gonna give you my heart to break

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control?
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break

I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
That's why I give you my heart to break

Every time
Every time
Heart to break
Yeah

One look at you, I'm powerless
I feel my body saying yes
Where's my self control?
And when you touch me, I'm a fool
This game I know I'm gonna lose
Makes me want you more (more, more)

Even if it means that I'll never put myself back together
Gonna give you my heart to break
Even if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter
Gonna give you my heart to break

I tried to fight, but I can't help it
Don't care if this is my worst mistake
'Cause no one else could do it better
That's why I give you my heart to break

// Can't Do Better //

Do anything to keep you near
Count imperfections in the mirror
No I can't let you leave
So I kill my insecurities
Every time she goes through her hair
I feel the tension in the air
No I can't let you leave
So I kill my insecurities

Ohh, you can't do better
Ohh, you can't do better

Do anything that it could take
Convince myself I'm in first place
And maybe you'll pick me
In an alternate reality
Am I not built to be the one?
Tried to be sweet, tried to be fun
No, I can't let you leave
No, it's not a possibility

Ohh, you can't do better
Ohh, you can't do better
Don't you know, oh
Can't you see
That there's no one else but me
Ohh, you can't do better

Don't you know that you were meant for me
Don't you know that this is killing me
And it's not a possibility

Ohh, you can't do better (no baby, no baby, no)
Ohh, you can't do better (no you can't, can't, can't do better)
Don't you know, oh
Can't you see
That there's no one else but me
Ohh, you can't do better
You can't do better (woo, ah!)
You can't do better

Every night turn into morning, can't get you off my mind
Get you off my mind, yeah

I just wanna get with you and never really feel it
Say I won't, but I can't help it

Dressing in your house, yeah

And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that

[lil aaron:]
I remember when I left town, it was different
I don't really miss it that much, reminiscing
Money ain't the issue now I do what I wanna
I remember splitting my last check with you
Pick me up, you used to pick me up at the corner
Tried to cop a cigarette, holes in your Impala
I didn't mean to leave you all on the back burner

So while I'm away in LA getting paid
Just know I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that
'Cause you drove me home when I wasn't sober, yeah
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that, no

Remember when we stayed up three days straight and passed out
Remember when we traded my Louis in for two ounce
Missed you real bad when I went to California
I got so excited when I seen you in the hallway
I remember when you said we'd make it both together
I remember when you said you're coming in December
Out of luck, must be out of love cause you're not here
Hit me up, never hit me up I waited, oh, oh, yeah

And I wish you could spend the night, spend the night
And I know that it's been some time, been some time

You used to let me cry on your shoulder
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
I'll never, I'll never forget that

I'll never, I'll never forget that, no

Yeah I was feeling so cool
When we rolled up before school
And sometimes I want it back
Been so busy counting stacks
Remember how we left off
Looking back that really sucked
I know I said, "I would call"
I know I said, "I would call"

You used to let me cry on your shoulder, yeah
And I'll never, I'll never forget that
Said I'll never, I'll never forget that

// If U Think About Me... //

Woo-ah!

I could give you love for a minute
But don't let it get too close
âCause I know the end and beginning
That's the way it always goes

Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine, new heart of mine
Time is money, time is money
I ainât got the time to buy a new heart of mine

Oh, I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I don't need (You-ah!)
'Cause I think about if you think about me

I could give you love for a minute
If it's only physical
Saw it in the rear-view mirror
That is just an obstacle

Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine, new heart of mine
Time is money, time is money
I ain't got the time to buy a new heart of mine

Oh, I think about if you think about me (Woo-ah!)
Circle right down when you're not around me (Woo-ah!)
And I lie each time when I say I donât need (You-ah!)
âCause I think about if you think about me

Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Time is money
