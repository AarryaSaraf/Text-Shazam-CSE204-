Album: Hard

// Is It Love //

No one lives in the future, no one lives in the past
The men who own the city make more sense than we do
Their actions are clear, their lives are their own
But you, went behind glass

Don't let this boy go, don't let this boy go
So long to the city, we'll retell the story they wrote
My lips part to talk but I forgot what I was trying to remember
And that will remain unsaid

Is it love, love that's on your mind
Love, not just of a certain kind
Love, no no not just of a certain kind
Is it love, love that's on your mind

The men who own the city make more sense than we do
But you, went behind glass
Ain't what we do without consequence

I'm saying it, I'm saying it
My lips part to talk but I forgot what I was trying to remember
And that will remain unsaid

// I Fled //

All inhibitions gone & on display
All innocence has gone & flown away
A winner now when that time there was none
To reinterpret all that's redundant
To be true to all my illusions
As for contentment all that's behind me
A loser now when I thought that I had won
No pearls now, none to speak of
To think of the past seems so uncool
I reconsidered fell into my swimming pool
I fled

// Silver Lining //

Your look will always find me hypnotized
Behind every cloud there's a silver lining
There's a pain in my heart
Is it for real or on show
Let's try to just make a point
Let's try to get to the point
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
For every star that shines at night
Another hope won't burn as bright
Is there a question to answer?
When only darkness lies in sight
Think of my arms to hold you tight
Let's try to get to the point
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
You worry too much kid
About how to say it
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Who's got the time to hang on?
Nobody, anymore
Your look will always find me hypnotized

// Woman Town //

This was my first night in woman town
But I somehow feel (I knew), I'd been here before
It ain't no wonder that you caught on
How long it took
I want to get all my kicks and thrills
I've seen the pictures
Enchant the eyes of all who pass by
She said it's no surprize that you wear shades
Every want rebounds from such a perfect curve
I don't need you, I'm a woman not some naming game
Somehow I know I'd been there hundreds of nights before
Woman after woman walked tall
So long back
Before we learnt to talk to you as them
And she said
I don't need for you to talk about me
You have the picture don't you see
It's no surprise that you wear shades
Every want rebounds from such a perfect curve
I don't need you, I'm a woman not some naming game

// A Man With A Good Car //

Who is that?
Just what is your business
Fate is in your hands
And your decisions
A man with a good car needs no justification
Fate is in my hands and in the transmission
I know that you think that you know what I said
(Poor Tom, monkey on his back)
But do you realize that what I said's not what I meant
I don't have wise blood
I'm deep in mystery
I asked luck to dance
The lady she's the wallflower
Well, she played the good cop
Took identification
Said "Don't trust to chance
Or believe in what you can't touch"
A man with a good car needs no justification
Fate is in my hands and in the transmission

// It Don't Matter //

If I keep my eyes on it
I will have more than I might need
To have the fingers crossed for
The break that I'm not sure may be
It don't matter
It don't matter
It don't matter
Before they slip away
Just look at where I'm at today
Not bad, huh, what do you say?
If I take the chance that comes
Put life into the days
Before they slip away
Make sure that times no luxury
To check off all the days
Before they slip away
It don't matter...
(Let's surrender, it's not our fight)
Remember when I was a child
I looked for things all the while
But look at where I am today
Not bad, huh?
It don't matter...

// Arabic //

The information I was given as follows:
Take care not to fall in love
For confirmation I was given as follows:
Take care not to fall like dominoes
It's okay while we touch
It's okay while we touch
It's okay in a clutch
While we sleep what dreams may come
It's okay in a clutch
While we sleep what dreams may come
Now I'm not sure that I'm secure
And I'm not sure that I'm secure
Keep your eyes shut or you'll watch television
You won't have to advertise
The camera won't lie where your mind goes it follows
Take care not to fall in like dominoes
It's okay
And I'm not sure that I'm secure
And I'm not sure that I'm secure

// A Piece Of My Heart //

A piece of my heart cries out loudly
For the funeral of innocence
To tell the truth, this elaborate story
Of goodness not so plausible
Stay at home at night
The mark of Cain is upon you
There's a sign on your forehead
There's no way you can stay out
A piece of my heart eyes the wheel in motion
With suspicion of coincidence
It don't grab me now, to swallow the notion
Of accident that no one meant
Stay at home at night
The mark of Cain is upon you
While we look for solutions
It's not safe when you go out
Burning up the night up the night
The heat is on
Do you do what you can do?
It looks like to me that you are only playing a part
Do you do what you can do?
Talk slow, in a trance

// Independence //

Like you said when we crawled down from the trees
We're in transition
I don't want to remain on the edge
We must embrace the new conditions
I'm alright, I'm alright
Through it's a contradiction
It's enough but less than I imagined
I'll get used to this
A one roomed apartment
If I fall behind with the rent
I'll have to borrow from a close friend
I'm alright, I'm alright
Through it's a contradiction
It's enough but less than I imagined
You always promise more than you can deliver
Independence ain't dependence
When you said it gets so cold that we could freeze
I reconsidered
I did all I could to be saved
It looks like I made the wrong decision
