// One Woman //

I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

(And ooh yeah, now)
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day,
You know it's always been that way

(Ooh yeah, now)
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop (ooh, ya'll)
The girl is right on time now (come on)

Her loving arms are there to greet me,
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

(One woman's making my home)
One women's making my home
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong.

(One woman's making my home)
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong

(One woman's making my home)
Baby baby baby...

// Talk To Me //

Talk to me talk to me
Darling I love the things you say
Talk to me baby talk to me
In your own sweet gentle way

Let me hear baby tell me dear
Tell me you love me so
Talk to me baby talk to me

Please play the part that I know
While I am so glad you were to mine

Ooh I love you baby

// My Girl //

I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it get a little cold outside, now baby
I've got the month of May, yeah

Well, I guess that you would say
What in the world make me feel this way?
My girl, you wouldn't believe it but
It's my girl

I've got so much honey, baby
Even the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I guess that you would say
What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
Make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
I love, I love my girl, my girl

I don't need nobody's money shucks
Fortune or fame, you can have it all, baby
'Cause I got all the riches
In my possession, baby
One man could ever claim

Oh, I guess that you would say
What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
Make me feel this way?

My girl, I love my girl
Ooh, my girl

// I Stand Accused //

Girl
I stand accused
Of loving you just a little too much
And I hope (oh Lord)
Sure enough hope it's not a crime
Guilty of loving you
(Oh baby)

I hope that I
That I never never never have to testify
If I do, if I do, everyone's gonna cry, baby
That boy is guilty (lord lord) of loving you

Although you belong to another boy, baby
And I may not stand the ghost of a chance
But I'll tell the world (y'all)
I love her, I need her, baby
And I'm a victim of circumstance
And been proven guilty
Oh, yes, I am, yes I am
Did you know?
One touch (lord lord lord)
And I find myself
Right back, right back on the witness stand
Shouting out, shouting out, shouting out
All over the land
I'm guilty
I'm guilty
Baby!
Please, mama, please...

// Gotta Find A New World //

I wanna be able to love when I need it ya...

// Tomorrow's Dream //

I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'd be satisfied now to gain one single thing

Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
I want my baby, tonight baby, I can't wait no longer
Here now baby

I give my heart and feeling of distress
Trying to ignore her pain, all the happiness
Anything you want girl, I will give complete
I'd do anything, baby, to overcome defeat

And don't say tomorrow come, it don't belong to anyone
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, oh baby, hey, c'mon

I look back now, girl, on tomorrow's dreams
Distant things are happening, not as bad as they seem
Don't put off tomorrow for what today might bring
I'll be satisfied to gain one single thing

Don't look away now, girl, things are looking bright
Don't put off tomorrow, girl, for what's in store tonight, baby
C'mon now baby, hey, tonight baby, baby
I can't wait no longer, comin' over baby

Get back, get back to where you once belonged
