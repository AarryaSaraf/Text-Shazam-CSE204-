// Train Of Consequences //

I'm doing you a favor
As I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? My name is trouble
I'm coming in for the kill...
In for the kill...
And you know I will...

Set the ball A-Rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life O' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing on my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed west
Hocked my brains...
Headed west...

Set the ball A-Rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life O' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

Oh, set the ball A-Rollin
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life O' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

Set the ball A-Rollin
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life O' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

// Black Curtains //

Hey, look around you
Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up, I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang, it happened
Time's up, Armageddon
Fire, meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

Escape, you're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

"Something's under my skin
Something's very strange
Playing with my mind
Tempting me to do you in."

Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom in a spider's web
Suffocating, no one hears my calls
Never-ending, 'til the black curtain falls

Snakes surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down, I'm drowning
How long?, I hold my breath
Dogs are chasing
My legs are paralysed
Pray, don't find me
My life is fading fast

Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains fall
Black curtains, never-ending
Black curtains

// Crown Of Worms //

I am the author, dream up your pain
Drink as did bacchus, rebel just like cain
Lord of the city, I shall remain
All pandemonium, I shall reign
Sit in my fortress, up on my hill
Drinking the wine, 'til I've had my fill
Building up high, my castle walls
Oh, to veil my splendid fall

I present you, I present to you,
I present you this crown of worms

Surrounding myself with mysery
Drawn curtains heavy of my history
Exquisite I am, perfect unity
On my left hand is false majesty
I feign affection, efute the true story
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory
I care for no one, my gospel is death
For me the light's gone, only darkness is left

I present you, I present to you,
I present you this crown of worms

As black in deed, as cold as stone
A commandment of one, as proud as gold
As neglected in spirit, as time is old
As legion is numbers, as legend is told
I am alone, with the agony of truth
My power of will, my judgement and chain
My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt,
My final confusion hidden from me till I'm done

// Ashes In Your Mouth (Live) //

People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall
Melting down all metals, tturning plows and sheats to swords
Shun words of the Bible, we need implements of war
Chailknes and red puddles of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer, says the dead shall rise again
Where do we go from here?
And should we really care
The end is finally here
God have mercy
Now we've rewtitten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

If you're fighting to live
It's OK to die!
The answer to your question is...
Welcome to tomorrow!

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

// Peace Sells (Live) //

What do you mean,
"I don't believe in God"?
I talk to him everyday.
What do you mean,
"I don't support your system"?
I go to court when I have to.
What do you mean,
"I can't get to work on time"?
I got nothing better to do.
And, what do you mean,
"I don't pay my bills"?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there is the new way,
I'll be the first in line.
But, it better work this time.

What do you mean,
"I hurt your feelings"?
I didn't know you had any feelings.
What do you mean,
"I ain't kind"?
I'm just not your kind.
What do you mean,
"I couldn't be president of the U.S.A."?
Tell me something, it's still

"We the people,"right?

Can you put a prise on peace?
Peace,
Peace sells...
Peace sells...
Peace sells..., but who's buying?
Peace sells..., but who's buying?
Peace sells..., but who's buying?
Peace sells..., but who's buying?
No, peace sells...

// Anarchy In The U.K.(Live) //

Right now
I am an anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want, but I know how get it
I want to destroy, possibly?

'Cause I want to be anarchy, no dog's body

Anarchy for the U.S.A.
It's coming sometime, it may be
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree

'Cause I want to be anarchy, in the city

Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

'Cause I want to be anarchy, it's the only way to be

Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Is this the U.D.A.?
Is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.S.A., or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies
'Cause I want to be anarchy, 'cause I want to be
Anarchy, you know what I mean?

'Cause I want to be anarchist, again I'm pissed

Destroy!
