// Insomnia //

[Dave Mustaine]

I'm running in quicksand
something's haunting me
the guilty past I've buried
my mind won't let me sleep

I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up
a solemn oath I make
cross my heart please let me sleep - I keep waking up
how much more do I take

My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
but the loudest voice
is the one I heed

Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomnia, awake till morning light
Insomnia, stirring deep inside
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights
I can't sleep - insomnia

I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up
the madness I must tame
my candle is burning - I keep waking up
both ends again today

The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
the things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows
I can't sleep

Insomnia, footsteps on the walk
Insomnia, I hear someone knock
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream
Insomnia, can you hear me scream

// Prince Of Darkness //

[Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman]

My victims are rich of poor, young or old, strong or weak
I cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames

I bring poverty, sickness and death
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

Evil, more evil than violence
Violent, more violent than death
Deadly, more deadly than man
I am yeah, yeah, I'm evil I am

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake I dance with the flames

Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness, unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darkness

// Enter The Arena //

[Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager]

"Here we go... crush, crush, crush 'em..."

// Crush 'Em //

[Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager/Marty Friedman]

Enter the arena and hit the lights
Step up now you're in for a ride
this is war, ain't no fun and games
we get it up, you go down in flames

Party time, going down
you better not mess us around
the stakes are rich, take a hit or stay
the price is high, someone's gonna pay

Heads I win, tails you lose
out of my way I'm coming through
roll the dice don't think twice
and we crush, crush 'em

Looking for trouble, now you've found it
you're a drum and we're gonna pound it

Last one standing wins the fight
hear us scream and shout all night
down on the floor and eat the grit
this is gonna hurt a little bit

Heads I win, tails you lose
out of my way I'm coming through
roll the dice don't think twice
and we crush, crush 'em

Now we lay you down to rest
you'll never be more than second best
step inside you're in for a ride
and we crush, crush 'em

Don't need reason, don't want names
just a John Doe to put to shame
step aside let me explain
the name of the game is pain

Now we've found you
We're gonna pound you
We're gonna beat you
Gonna defeat you
We're gonna bust you
We're gonna crush you
We're gonna crush 'em

// Breadline //

[Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager/Marty Friedman]

Ain't got no job
Ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car
His life's a joke

Living on the skids
Thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

Forgot who he is
Forgot who he was
Used to call the shots
Now he can't connect the dots

A mover and shaker
Getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline

Watch him dance

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline
About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

No one, nothing, nowhere
Dancing on the breadline

He forgot and he ain't got nothing

// The Doctor Is Calling //

[Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager/Marty Friedman]

The doctor is calling

Something's gone wrong
Nowhere do I belong
I listen to the voices in the dark room

Something's going down
But I can't make a sound
Looking past the bars of my mind

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling

Always sharing trips
Remove me from your lips
Sight and mind still and never go away

One too many tantrums
Deviated symptoms
Better lock the phantom away

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalkline crawling
I hear the doctor calling me away

This place is my home
My mind still runs free
The doctor's prescription
Less for you and more for me

The coat of arms falling
I hear the doctor calling
The family crest is falling
I hear the doctor calling
I see the chalkline crawling
I hear the doctor calling me away
A merciful embalming
I hear the doctor calling me away

// I'll Be There //

[Dave Mustaine/Bud Prager/Marty Friedman]

I heard the voice of redemption
For me there is no exemption
I started praying

I heard the voice of satisfaction
Needing me for benefaction
I started pleading

I heard the bells begin to chime
Warning me oh lord
Don't let this be my time
Don't let this be my time

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher
When nothing fits and nothing seems right
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you

You saw me slide, you saw me fall
We kept our pride through it all
We started screaming

When skies are dark, no sun shines through
I know I see the light in you
We stopped dreaming and started believing

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher
When nothing fits and nothing seems right
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you
I'll be there

In my hour of need
You were there always
Now it's time for me to be there for you too
Always

I'll be there for you

// Wanderlust //

[Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman]

As sure as the sun rises in the east
Another gunman will come seeking my defeat
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still
Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

As I ride into the sunset to take another town
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day
Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun

The game I play has caused a lot of grief
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief

I'm an outcast riding into town alone
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land

I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land
I got wanderlust

// Ecstasy //

[Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman]

You live in a world of fantasy
You live in a web of deceit
You want it all including me
You like it all to be neat

I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Hide the truth to deceive them all
How my good intention lies

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring ecstasy

Secret meetings that we hide
Deeds of iniquity
The price of foolish pride
The cost of immorality

And we hide the truth to deceive them all
And the pain of what will never be

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring ecstasy

// Seven //

[Dave Mustaine/David Ellefson]

Full of greed you sell your soul
Full of pride a heavy load
You eat yourself gluttony
Resent yourself you envy me

Everything turns into wrath
You lust yourself to death

Deep fears that drive us
Hid beneath disguises
Judge the world within
Forgive my deadly sins

Procrastination always giving up
Something better comes to interrupt
Cast your verdict down to me
Spare me your bleeding sympathy

Only care how you appear
Clearly see you can't see clear

Deep fears that drive us
Hid beneath disguises
Judge the world within
Forgive my deadly sins

Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, lust, deadly seven
Seven deadly sins of mine

On every street
And corner lie
These seven deadly sins of mine

// Time: The Beginning //

[Dave Mustaine/Marty Friedman]

Father time, I'm running late
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

An enemy I can't defend
My final place a deadly end
Life's just a speck in space
Dreams of an eternal resting place

I can't get any younger
Time has brutal hunger

// Time: The End //

[Dave Mustaine]

I see Chronos
His eyes are on fire
He holds my life
And I see my time expire

Beat the clock
My head starts to spin
Tick, tock
I can't let time win
