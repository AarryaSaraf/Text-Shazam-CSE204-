// Last Rites / Loved To Deth //

Your body's empty now as I hold you
Now you're gone, I miss you, but I told you
I remember bad times more than good
There's no coming back even if we could

I loved you to death
I loved you to death

If I can't have you, then no one will
And since I won't, I'll have to kill
My only love, something I've never felt
Now you've gone to Heaven
And I'll burn in Hell!

I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I... loved you... to death
I... loved you... to death
Whoa!

And now I'm down below, what do I see?
You didn't go to Heaven, you're down in Hell with me
And now you're coming back, "Baby, take me please"
I really think I would if you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once, before you kept me on a string
I'd rather go without than take what you would bring

I loved you to death!
Whoa!

// Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good! //

I am a sniper, always hit the mark
Paid assassin working after dark
Looking through the night using infra-red
Target's on you, aimed at your head

Ten thousand up front
Ten thousand when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And you know I'll do it, too
And I'm coming back for you
Back for you

I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
Now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you

Don't you know that
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good

You'd better believe it

// The Skull Beneath The Skin //

Whoa!

Mean and infectious, the evil prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre, as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon trapped without a plea, oh

Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate
Pins stickin' through the skin, the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life, no one hears a sound
Help me!

Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears, he'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath

Now you're drawn and quartered, your bones will make the 'X'
Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix; religion has been lost

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

The skull beneath the skin

// The Boots //

You keep sayin' you got somethin' for me
Somethin' you call love, but I call sex
You've been kissin' when you ought-a-be screwin'
And now someone else can kiss your ass

These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You been lyin' and there ain't no believin'
And you keep sayin' what you want in the bed
You been stayin' when you ought-a-be-a leavin'
And what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

These boots are made for walkin', that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep dressin' ways you shouldn't be dressin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha!
I just found me a brand-new box spring mattress
What? You know, bitch, you got a lot to learn

These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do
And one of these days these boots are gonna stomp all over you
Yeah!

Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Are you ready, boots?
Start walkin'

And you think I'm kiddin', don'tcha?

// Rattlehead //

Well, here I come

Stand up and plant your feet
Listen; I'm letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let it loose, I don't fuckin' care

Rattlehead!

A dose of Metal you need
To bang your head 'til you bleed
It's time for snapping some necks
Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth

Rattlehead!

You; your head, is pounding with pain
You shake loose parts of your brain
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Frying; annihilating you, ha-ha-ha-ha

There's someone back in the shadows
You feel, though you can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy
Don't wear no leather to fit in
Don't wear no spikes to be cool
Don't want no woman beside him
Just make it fast, loud, and rude

Rattlehead!

I'm a Rattlehead!
Rattle your goddamn head

// Chosen Ones //

You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones

Human bones blanket the dirt
Of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here
But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones

Black shadows fill the sky
As the creature's eyes grow near
Raise the shield
Of the holy pilgrim high into the air
Heaven's powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh, the beast is coming
To put you to the test
Look out

Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape and steal and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign; for now, I stay
I stay to kill!

You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For death surely awaits you
With sharp and pointy teeth
An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones

// Looking Down The Cross //

Now before they take me and my blessed life
Now you'll know why Deth was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils; they'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away; there's no place to hide
Whoa-oh...

Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built; high priests of sin
Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in
Beckoning you in

Down the walkways, through the blood-stained town
Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
Led to stay, to die beside the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be

And now to you, this will come a putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath, malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of Choronzon
More disease than the wind of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused, no need for confession
Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundred-folds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child, no one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner

And this was all you got, so don these broken wings
The sands of time run out, bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name?
Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream? You're weeping all alone!

Looking down the cross, speak no evil
I'm looking down the cross, speak no evil
Looking down the cross, speak no evil
I'm looking down the cross, speak no evil
Whoa-oh-oh...

// Mechanix //

Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!

We were shifting gears hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels too slow

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!

I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love

Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, y'know, lucky for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life; fuck yeah!
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat
Oh, yeah-yeah!
