// That's My Kind Of Night //

I got that real good feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35s
Pretty girl by my side

You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night!

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country ride hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain

You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
Yeah, that's my kind of night!

My kind or your kind is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
That's my kind of night!
Yeah, that's my kind of night!
Come on...

// Beer In The Headlights //

Honey suckle in the air, breeze blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
Your my favorite song, won't you let me sing-a-long

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby, boots stiring up the dirt
Cottonfield concert, you got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl your looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights

With your beer in the headlights,

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere, nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Ohhh ohh ohhh
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and your
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips,
Girl your looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights

With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights

// Crash My Party //

It donât matter what plans I got, I can break âem.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I donât mind telling all the guys I canât meet âem.
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night

Girl, I donât care. Oh I just gotta see what youâre wearing.
Your hair, is it pulled up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.

[Chorus:]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me.
You donât have to worry âbout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby thatâs alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The doorâs unlocked. Iâll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

Ainât a spot downtown thatâs rockinâ the way that you rock me.
Ainât a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And Iâm gone so long, hang on. Iâll meet you in a minute or two.

[Chorus]

If itâs 2 in the morning
And youâre feeling lonely
And wondering what Iâm doing...

[Chorus:]
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me
You donât have to worry âbout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night;
Wreck my plans, baby thatâs alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I'll pour you a drink.
The doorâs unlocked. Iâll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.

(Call me, call me, call me)

Baby you can crash my party anytime.

// Roller Coaster //

She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss
With Bacardi on her lips
And I was done

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd
Under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back

And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her

When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster

Like that old beach roller coaster

// We Run This Town //

Seventeen, we owned those streets 
Parking lot, that was our spot 
Thatâs where weâd always meet 
And weâd roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
Weâd light the midnight up 

[Chorus:]
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go âround 
Nothinâ but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town 

All the girls next door
Theyâd meet us out there
They couldnât wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before theyâd leave 
Guess they thought we were cool because 

We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go âround 
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill 
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town 

From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didnât know nothin'
But we knew everything 

[Repeat Chorus]

High five and look around
Damn right, we run this town 
Man, I love this town
Come on

// Drink A Beer //

When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone

I took a walk to clear my head
And this is where the walking led
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess

Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long, my friend
Until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to...

...sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer
Yeah

// I See You //

Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you 
They're hookinâ me up, yeah
Buyinâ me drinks with a thousand girls 
There's just one thing

[Chorus:]
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone 
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpinâ up there with the band
Takinâ me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you

Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find a girl and take her home
But there's just one thing wrong

[Repeat Chorus]

Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye

[Repeat Chorus]

Baby, I see you
Baby, I see you

// Goodbye Girl //

Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
When I say I love you, you just say "I know"
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world
All fixed up, my goodbye girl

You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
There you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl

It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl

The sun is gonna make it's way around again
but the rain is always waiting just around the bend
And there you go, wrecking my whole world
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl
All fixed up, my goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

// Play It Again //

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Thinkin', "No way she ain't got one."
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar

She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song.
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is."
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again

// Blood Brothers //

We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in an old pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta Dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us

Blood brothers closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code it's an unwrote law
When you mess with one you gotta take us all.

Blood brother's closer than your next to kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Time can fly on by
Everything can change
Until the day we die
We'll always remain
We'll remain
Yeah yeah yeah

Blood brothers closer than you next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other

Yeah brothers like that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers

Yeah yeah
Oh oh
Blood brothers

// Out Like That //

You got me all caught up
The way you look tonight
We could head downtown
Or I can turn around, up here, on the right
Ah, just look at this sky 
The rain ainât far from fallinâ down 
And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops 
Parked out in the middle of nowhere

Thereâs a place I can get up against your lips 
Thatâs where I gotta be with you lookin' like this 
Letâs get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ainât gotta hold back
If weâre gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

And Iâll grab your door
You can take my hand
Hop up on my shoulders and Iâll walk us over
Where we can dance 
And Iâll leave the headlights on 
So, I can see your face 
Spin you âround in the mud 
Yeah, soak it all up, baby 
Whatâcha say, whatâcha say

I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops 
Girl, Iâm talkin' country kinda crazy, yeah

Out where I can get up against your lips 
Thatâs where I gotta be with you lookin' like this 
Letâs get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ainât gotta hold back
If weâre gonna go out, baby
Let's go out like that

Yeah, I wanna feel your heart go tic-toc
While the rain from your hair drip-drops 
Gettinâ country kinda crazy in the middle of nowhere

Out where I can get up against your lips 
Thatâs where I gotta be with you lookin' like this 
Letâs get lost somewhere
Anywhere we ainât gotta hold back
If weâre gonna go out, baby
Let's go out, baby

If weâre gonna go out, baby
Letâs go out like that

Yeah girl, that's where it's at
Letâs go out like that

// Shut It Down //

She likes to watch him out the window
Goinâ âround in circles under the sun
Somethinâ âbout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookinâ forward to after heâs done

He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standinâ in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judginâ by her smile, itâs about time to

Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sunâs still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
Shut it down

He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkinâ maybe he oughta just call it a day

Shut it down
Lotta work left to do, the sunâs still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Shut it down

Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittinâ still

Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Close the door, lock it out, lock it out
Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down
Shut it down

// Dirt Road Diary //

Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet.
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up.
Weâd drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial.
One little country station was all there was.

Checking gates, fixing fence rows â thatâs how my story goes.

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary.
Itâs right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridinâ round, windows down on a summer night.
I was there, and that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.

I remember when I turned sixteen I got a license and some gasoline.
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didnât fly down.
If wasnât the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river.
Every inch of that county was sacred ground.

I wish I knew where that old truck was.
If it could talk it could tell on us.

If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary.
Itâs right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridinâ round, windows down on a summer night.
I was there, and that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.

It ain't a book underneath my bed;
Just a dusty memory lane burned in my head.

Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridinâ round, windows down feeling right
I was there, that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.

Just ride around my little town and youâll see how I wrote my dirt road diary.

// What Is It With You //

Girl, there ain't no way you don't know how pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows the trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back I sent your way
I shoulda just took a shot of warm whiskey and called it a day

[Chorus]
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you

I spent half the day all hungover the morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up, baby, it'd be another week of this
I keep prayin' that you mighta left something
Something when you get undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess

[Chorus]
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you

Oh, I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all the heaven and hell that you put me through
What is it with you
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you

What is it with you
Oh, what is it with you

// Sunburnt Lips //

Back again in the back of this pasture
Sweatin' bad in the cab of this tractor
I oughta be worried about the rain
The last hundred rows could've been a little straighter
Guess I'll be hittin' them again later
I could turn this red dirt all day, yeah

Dreamin' 'bout sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Behind the dust is a big ol' blue sky
Kinda reminds me of those blue eyes smilin' back at me
I slide up a gear and go a little faster
Just a little breeze and I'm right back there
And I can almost feel

Her sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

Oh, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips

Sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And one sweet, sweet memory of layin' on the beach
With her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

// Better Than My Heart //

I'm feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkey-tonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pilled my hat down low, wouldn't want you to know I was in this shape

[Chorus]
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now that's really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold, memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine

[Chorus x2]
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah, they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Better than my heart

// Your Mama Should've Named You Whiskey //

Just a little taste won't hurt at all
But once I get a sip, I know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone, all gone
90 proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

Girl, you got a smile like a devil on my shoulder
Tempting me sayin', honey come over right now, right now
I know I shouldn't wanna, but I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be wakin' up hurtin' in the morning
Shoulda come with a warning

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah, and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, I'm hangin; on
I'm a fool in love, I'm long past gone
Yeah, so, come on

Your mama should've named you whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Oh, and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby, your mama should've named you whiskey

I'm addicted girl, such a fool
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool
