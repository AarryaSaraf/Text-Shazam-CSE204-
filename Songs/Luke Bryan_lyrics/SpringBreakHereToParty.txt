Album: SpringBreakHereToParty

// Wild Weekend //

We've been gettin' beat up by this ol' life,
seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night and sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday.
I got a bunch of buddies I ain't seen in a while,
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile, with some home brew, Malibu and Miller Lite.
Girl put on that short little party dress and make me a little bit
jealous. Itâs gunna be a wild weekend, been on the phone with all my friends.
Thereâs a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg donât float and the ice donât melt, weâll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet weâll fall in love again and again and again.
Itâs gunna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, cell phone's singin' that
All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight,
bad to the bone rington, come on, come on, come on, baby let's get gone.
It's bumper to bumper in the outbound, and we're already gettin' down.
Itâs gunna be a wild weekend, been on the phone with all my friends.
Thereâs a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg donât float and the ice donât melt, weâll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet weâll fall in love again and again and again.
Itâs gunna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
Aww put on the short little party dress, make me a little bit jealous, get me thinkin' goodness.
Itâs gunna be a wild weekend, been on the phone with all my friends.
Thereâs a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg donât float and the ice donât melt, weâll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet weâll fall in love again and again and again.
Itâs gunna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
It's gunna be a wild, wild, wild weekend. Yeah.
We been needing this for a long, long time.
Ooo my baby sure is lookin' fine.
What's up man? How ya'll been? Throw me a ski rope.

// Cold Beer Drinker //

Hey! Whiskey burns me up, wine turns my teeth all red.
Tequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head.
But let me tell ya I'm a real big fan, of ice fishin' for them aluminum cans.

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger.
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll.
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger,
king of the grill and a short putt sinker,
I'm just a cold beer drinker.

Monday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hard workin' man.
Responsible, kinda dull, head-down, stick to the plan.
But all my buddies know me better than that, get us all together and we start throwin' 'em back.

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger.
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll.
I'm a killer karaoke country singer, top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger,
king of the grill and a short putt sinker,
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker.

As far as I'm concerned, it's the All-American way.
Twist the top off, just to cap off the day, hey hey, hey hey, hey hey.

I'm just a cold beer drinker, check out the callus on pop-top finger.
Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack rarin' to go.
Don't you know I'm a killer karaoke country singer,
top-water rattle-trap spinner bait slinger, king of the grill and a short putt sinker,
I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker, I'm just a cold beer drinker. Yeah.

// In Love With The Girl //

It feels like I woke up one mornin'
and it all changed without warnin'
I don't know how our paths crossed
but all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers

[Chorus]
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
was it the sweet song she was singin'
or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

I talk about bein' caught off guard
Talk about an old boy fallin' hard
Think about a few weeks flyin' by
and talk about losin' track of time
Now I'm countin' every second until I see her

[Chorus]
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
was it the sweet song she was singin'
or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

I was cool with hangin around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Sayin things I ain't never said
and bein with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

// If You Ain't Here To Party //

We got beer, and a tub,
And some good lookin' girls
Dressed to the nights,
Lookin' for a good time

Jacked up trucks
Stacked in thick
White rocks stuck
In the mud grips

And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D.
And don't you dare step out on the floor

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playin' a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Lookin' so fine shakin' that thang
In the zydeco cage and purple rain

Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along..
Man, you're here all alone

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party

If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Goin' home alone is
If you ain't here to party

Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party

Throw your keys on the bar
You ain't drivin' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's gonna be

'Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah whoa
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night

// Love In A College Town //

Girl Iâll be over there
With my buddies drinkinâ beer 
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song 
In a little while
When youâre ready shoot me that smile 
That way Iâll know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on 

We wonât ever look as good as we do now
So letâs take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothinâ like love in a college town

All the rumors fly
Did you hear who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
Thereâs old whatâs-his-name
He just canât seem to graduate
Hittinâ on the new crop, buyinâ em lemon drops
Man thatâs just wrong! 

We wonât ever look as good as we do now
So letâs take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town

Iâm gonna fail this test
Thinking âbout your dress
Layinâ on my floor
Runninâ out the door 
A-A-B-A-C, that sounds good to me!

We wonât ever look as good as we do now
So letâs give it one more shot
Baby howâs that sound? 
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town

Gottaâ love love in a college town

// Suntan City //

(It's 'bout that time a year again!)
It was bumper to bumper when I hit Bay County
So I stopped and let the top down;

Speakers were a bumpin',
little hip-hop somethin'
I was stirrin' up a coke and crown;

Didn't even check in the room,
We went straight for the beach,
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt;

Now I'm scoutin' my spot,
Where we were gunna rock,
With the biggest buzz I ever felt

[Chorus]
Now I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
and they keep rollin' in,
like the waves on the sand

Yea, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
with a cold one in my hand
(Whoooo!)

Hey there cutie with a Kentucky coozie,
have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends,
ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?

[Chorus]
Yea I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

They keep strollin' by,
and they keep rollin' in,
like the waves on the sand

Yea, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
with a cold one in my hand

[Bridge]
I gotta buddy who blew all his money,
and he had to stay his broke-ass home,
He's been goin' crazy, blowin' up my phone
Wantin' to know whats goin' on

[Chorus]
I tell him I'm sittin pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls

And they keep strollin' by,
and they keep rollin' in,
like the waves on the sand

Yea, I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
with a cold one in my hand
(Yeah!)

Sittin' pretty, right here in Suntan City

// Spring Break-Up //

It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was trying to talk to some other girl
And she was bird-dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled over to the side
Brushed her hair back and looked her straight in the eye

It was a spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

No I don't need your number
Don't want to be your Facebook friend
I hate to break it to ya
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy, well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye

Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that ol' beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this...

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we got a little drunk
And had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up

Spring break-up,
Baby don't cry,
You ain't from here and neither am I
We got a little drunk
And we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye
Bye bye bye bye

// Little Bit Later On //

Drop it boys

Whatcha doing later on?
He said aw man

I said I'll swing by and get ya
And you'll be there and I bet ya
We can find a little something to do a little later on

I say hey man
What's Jr and them doing later on?
He said aw man
He's gotta check on his momma and them later on

So it looks like you and me
So let's ride around and see
If we can find a little bit of trouble a little later on

Come on!

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
Gonna find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're gonna get on outta here a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Throw it out there, see where it lands
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

I said hey girl
Whatcha doing later on?
She said
I'm getting off work later on

I said call a couple of your friends
'Cause me and my buddy Ben
We're gonna be back by to get you a little later on

Haha yeah

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
Gonna find a good spot
Crank up a few songs
We're gonna get on outta here a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Grab a pretty girl, take her by the hand
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on

Meet up with you little bit, little bit, little bit later on
Come on now a little bit, little bit, little bit later on
We're gonna break it all down to the break of dawn
A little bit, little bit, little bit later on

When the stars come out
And the sun's long gone
We're gonna drink up a lotta beer a little later on
We're gonna do it up right
All night long
Gonna worry 'bout tomorrow a little later on

You know out in the country don't make no plans
Find a little bar with a guitar band
Rockin' out all night and roll back home
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

Lay a little bit of rubber down on some asphalt
50 yard line, better not get a butt call
A little bit later on
Find a little spot right down on the creek bank
Really don't care what your momma and daddy might think
A little bit later on
A little bit later on

// Just A Sip //

What gives you courage to walk up to a ten in a bar
What turns the nervous into a rockstar
What gets you through the week then
And right on through the weekend
And puts you back together again

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

What makes a good ol' boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now

Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

You can chug it down all you want
But you ain't gonna last long
Trust me you can get there with

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mmhmm so good, mmhmm so right
Starting this night off so right with...
Just a sip

Takin' one of them big ol' sips

// Buzzkill //

You're like a screen flashin', insufficient funds,
Cops knockin' when the party's just begun. 
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat. 
You're a cell phone splashin' in my coffee cup, 
A fumble on the one when my team was going up,
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know,

[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringin' me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.
Baby, you're a buzzkill.

I used to do everything I could do to do nice things,
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change. 
Everybody knows you ended us.
So why you showing up here on my side of the tracks?
Slipping in this bar just to check out where I'm at,
I was a six pack in, now I'm as sober as a judge, cause

[Chorus]
You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringin' me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.

As if it didn't hurt enough, Now I gotta see you flirt.
Nailed to the stool, watching you work,
Don't you give a damn about how I feel,You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're such a buzzkill.

[Chorus]
Yeah, You're a buzzkill, every time you come around.
Those beers might as well have been poured out.
Why are you still showin' up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me,
and mess up what this night was gonna be?
You walk right by, crashing my high like I know you will, 
you little buzzkill.
You little buzzkill.

// Shore Thing //

There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room ain't ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy,
To tote down to the beach all by myself

I'd be willing to bet,
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help

But it's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight

I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take us out at a bar
Throw a beer on the band
Toss down head into a parking lot road

And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Huggin' all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
Cause all I know

It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand

We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight

// Sorority Girl //

[Verse 1]
You got your sundress on for game day
Just to drink beer on an old tailgate
You were born and raised to be a southern belle
But in a place like this you like to raise a little hell
You got your year-round tan
Youâre on the five year plan
You shake your little pom poms up in the stands

[Chorus]
My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooo donât know what Iâm gonna do around those
Zetaâs
Thetaâs
Chi Oâs
and little Phi Muâs
Hey Yea Hey Yea
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl

[Verse 2]
You got that high school boyfriend you still think about
You know how to make him jealous when he comes into town
You drive your little love bug when youâre skipping class
And your sisters get you home when youâre drunk off your ass
You know how to be a lady
Yea youâre still your daddyâs baby
You drive the band and the boys and the bartenders crazy

[Chorus]
My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooo donât know what Iâm gonna do around those
Zetaâs
Thetaâs
Chi Oâs
and little Phi Muâs
Hey Yea Hey Yea
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl

Ooo here you come again
Walking my way
And there I go again with
nothing to say
My my my little ADPi
Kappa Delta
Tri Delts you look so fine
Ooo donât know what Iâm gonna do around those
Zetaâs
Thetaâs
Chi Oâs
and little Phi Muâs
Hey Yea Hey Yea
My my sorority girl
My my sorority girl
Yea you rock this county boyâs world
My my sorority girl

// Shake The Sand //

From that first second
I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know I've been going crazy over you
Here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

This can't be no buzz from the salt in the air
I ain't never had no drink do me like this, I swear
Feels like I'm spinning around, watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on, feeling right
Before I hit the lights

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

So I'll just keep holdin' on,
Lovin' you all night long

Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to lovin' on me...
Let's shake the sand off the sheets
Let's shake the sand off the sheets

// Take My Drunk Ass Home //

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But 1 turned to 10 and 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I cant find my keys for all this parkin' lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
'Cause my ex-girlfriend ain't lookin' half bad

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

"Help me up, aw put me back down put me back down"

I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I, I look like hell, I feel like shit
I think its time I call it quits

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home

Yea its time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, cant find my cell phone
Yea my lips all busted and my buzz is gone
Its time to take my drunk ass home

If y'all agree, then sing along
Its time to take, my drunk ass home

"Oh somebody call me a cab, please"
