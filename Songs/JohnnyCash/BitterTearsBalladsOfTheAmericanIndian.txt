// As Long As The Grass Shall Grow //

As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow 
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow 
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation 
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation 
After the US revolution cornplanter was a chief 
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief 
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed 
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined 
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand 
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now 
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how 
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam 
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam 
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin 
It will drown the Indians graveyards cornplanter can you swim 
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground 
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south 
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth 
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site 
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right 
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way 
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay 
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea 
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy 
As long as the moon shall rise... 
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring 
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling 
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time 
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine 
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill 
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill 
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow 
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow 
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you thirsty) 
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass shall grow

// Apache Tears //

Hoof prints and foot prints, deep ruts the wagons made
The victor and the loser came by here
No head stones, but these bones bring the mascalero death moans
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands lying here
Petrified, but justified are these apache tears

Dead grass, dry roots, hunger crying in the night
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here
And who saw the young squaw, they judged by their whiskey law
Tortured till she died of pain and fear
Where the soldiers lay her back, are the black apache tears

The young men, the old men, the guilty and the innocent
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears
The red men, the white men, no fight ever took this land
So don't raise the dust when you pass here
They're sleeping and in my keeping are these apache tears

// Custer //

Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin' 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin' 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again 
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore 
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin' 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre 
But the General he don't ride well anymore 
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent 
And the General he don't ride well anymore 
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore
