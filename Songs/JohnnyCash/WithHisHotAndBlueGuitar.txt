// Rock Island Line //

Now this here's a story about the Rock Island Line
Well the Rock Island Line she runs down into New Orleans
There's a big tollgate down there and you know
If you got certain things on board when you go through the tollgate
Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
Well a train driver he pulled up to the tollgate
And a man hollered and asked him what all he had on board and said

I got livestock
I got livestock
I got cows
I got pigs
I got sheep
I got mules
I got all live stock

Well he said you're alright boy you don't have to pay no toll
You can just go right on through so he went on through the tollgate
And as he went through he started pickin' up a little bit of speed
Pickin' up a little bit of steam
He got on through he turned and looked back at the man he said

Well I fooled you
I fooled you
I got pigiron
I got pigiron
I got old pigiron

[Chorus]
Down the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
Rock Island Line it's the road to ride
Rock Island Line it's a mighty good road
Well if you ride it you got to ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station for the Rock Island Line

Looked cloudy in the west and it looked like rain
Round the curve came a passenger train
North bound train on a southbound track
He's alright a leavin' but he won't be back

[Chorus]

Oh I may be right and I may be wrong
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Well the engineer said before he died
There were two more drinks that he'd like to try
The conductor said what could they be
A hot cup of coffee and a cold glass of tea

[Chorus]

// (I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle //

He was riding Number 9
Heading south from Caroline
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

Got in trouble, had to roam
Left his gal and left his home
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

Just a kid, acting smart
He went and broke his darling's heart
I guess he was too young to know

They took him off the Georgia Main
Locked him to a ball and chain
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

All alone he bears the shame
He's a number, not a name
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

All he does is sit and cry
When the evening train goes by
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

He'll be locked there in this cell
'Til his body's just a shell
And his hair turns whiter than snow

He'll never see that gal he pines
He's in Georgia doing time
He heard that long lonesome whistle blow

// If The Good Lord's Willing //

If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
I'll be there just as sure as you're born

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll comb my hair down brush my teeth
Shine up slick up dress up neat
Get everything looking just right

'Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
I'll be there you can bet your bottom dollar
If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise

If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
I'll be there a knockin' at your door
With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best, I'll be there lookin' my best

If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs feed the cows and chop all the logs
Get all of my working done cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
I'll be there with a ring for your hand

If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise

// Remember Me (I'm The One Who Loves You) //

When you're all alone and blue
No one to tell your troubles to
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

When this world turns you down
Not a true friend can be found
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

And through all kinds of weather
You'll find, I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

We're together right or wrong
Where you go I'll tag along
Remember me, I'm the one who loves you

// Doin' My Time //

On this old rock pile with a ball and chain
They call me by a number, not a name Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

When that old judge looked down and smiled
Said I put you up that river for a while Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

You can hear my hammer, you can hear my saw
Gonna swing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
With an achin' heart and a worried mind

Well now it won't be long just a few more days
I'll settle down and quit my rowdy ways Lord, Lord
With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
She's waited for me while I've done my time
