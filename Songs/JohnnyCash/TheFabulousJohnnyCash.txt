// Run Softly, Blue River //

(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep 
Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine 
Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time 
Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife 
And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life 
And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too 
Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
Oh I thrill to her kisses... 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
(Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep)

// Frankie's Man Johnny //

Well now, Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
They were true as a blue, blue sky
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wanderin' eye
But he was her man nearly all of the time

Well, Johnny he packed up to leave her, but he promised he'd be back
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
He said, "I'm your man, I wouldn't do you wrong"
Well, Frankie curled up on the sofa, thinkin' about her man
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
He was Frankie's man, he wadn't doin' her wrong

Then, in the front door walked a redhead, Johnny saw her right away
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
He was Frankie's man, but she was far away
He sang every song to the redhead, she smiled back at him

Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him, she slapped him a time or two
She said, "I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
If you're her man you better treat her right"

Well, the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong

// That's All Over //

Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you
But that's all over my crying days are through
When you left my heart was cold and every day was blue
But that's all over I've found somebody new
Someone that can make me happy make me wanna smile
Someone I'm gonna have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you
That's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm

Someone that can make me happy...
Yes that's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm

// Troubadour //

(Troubadour troubadour troubadour)
The troubadour the troubadour sings from his heart
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
The song was for someone he loved so true
Who loved him then left him for someone new
The troubaour the troubadour smile as he sings but his heart is breaking in two

They beg for more the troubadour sings once again
The song that's the hit of the show
Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar alone in the bright spotlight's glow
There is a hush in the darkened hall a few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
And oh her heart aches most of all
Troubadour troubadour her heart aches most of all

// One More Ride //

I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm takin' one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin'
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin'
One more ride
One more ride

I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin'
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing
One more ride
One more ride

As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin'
If I don't come back on a oneway track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin'
One more ride
One more ride

// I'd Rather Die Young //

I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
To see someone's picture where my picture hung 
Believe me my darling I'd rather die young 
I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care 
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair 
Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me 
I'd rather die young.. 

I'd rather die young...

// Pickin' Time //

I got cotton in the bottom land
It's up and growin' and I got a good stand
My good wife and them kids of mine
Gonna get new shoes, come Pickin' Time
Get new shoes come Pickin' Time.

Ev'ry night when I go to bed
I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
They live on beans eight days and nine
But I get 'em fat come Pickin' Time
Get 'em fat come come Pickin' Time.

The corn is yellow and the beans are high
The sun is hot in the summer sky
The work is hard til layin' by
Layin' by til Pickin' Time
Layin' by til Pickin' Time.

It's hard to see by the coal-oil light
And I turn it off purty early at night
'Cause a jug of coal-oil costs a dime
But I stay up late come Pickin' Time
Stay up late come Pickin' Time.

My old wagon barely gets me to town
I patched the wheels and I watered 'em down
Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
To haul my cotton come Pickin' Time
Haul my cotton come Pickin' Time.

Last Sunday mornin' when they passed the hat
It was still nearly empty back where I sat
But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time
The Lord'll wait til Pickin' Time.

// Shepherd Of My Heart //

You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly 
It's a heart that needs your everloving care 
You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity lead it not into the valley of despair 
While it's in your keeping guard it with your love 
Shelter it from harm along life's way 
You're the shepherd of my heart and darling honestly 
It's a heart that will not ever go astray 
You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know 
You have but to speak and my heart will obey 
It's at your command my dear because it loves you so 
So my darling shepherd guide it where you may 
If it be green pastures or a rocky road it will follow you and not ask why 
You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows 
And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky

// Suppertime //

Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening shadows came
Then winding down an old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
Through the distant clouds I see my mother
Her face is shining bright, with tender love
She's gone up in heaven, with her maker
And I can still hear her voice, from up above
(and she said)
Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last

// Oh, What A Dream //

I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers 
Oh, what a dream 
The houses all were silver towers 
Oh, what a dream 
Beside the road an angel sat, 
I said hello and tipped my hat 
And stopped when I saw her smile 
And set me down a while 
I set me down a while 
You dreamer you

I tried the angel for a kiss 
Oh, what a dream 
But she turned away and my lips missed 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I'll have you know 
I met you just a while ago 
You're welcome for to sit 
But calm yourself a bit, sir 
Calm yourself a bit 
You dreamer you

I fell in love like one, two, three 
Oh, what a dream 
I asked the angel to marry me 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I can't marry you, 
But I'm a dream that can come true 
There are dreams of much my worth 
That live upon the earth, sir 
Live upon the earth 
You dreamer you"

Then I awoke and found my love 
Oh, what a dream 
As heavenly as the one above 
Oh, what a dream 
We'll marry in a sea of flowers, 
Home will be a silver tower 
There'll be heaven in my life 
With an angel for a wife 
With an angel for a wife 
You dreamer you 
You dreamer you

// Mama's Baby //

She said that she just couldn't leave her mother
I met a girl in our town I tour all my resistance down
I thought what a dream this gonna be
I live with her a month or two and like any boy in love will do
Ask her if she would marry me

But she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Then I said well then probably the only thing that's left for me it's a going come back in a year
And so, the year past away, and then I try to win her hand again
She even pact her close, but wouldn't go

Cause she was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother

Well I hang around till finally I asked her to marry me
Her mother says that it would be alright
We bought ourselfs a little home
And I finally got her all alone but she stays with her mother every night

Cause she's a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
Though she love me like she never love the other
She was a Mama's Baby, Mama's Baby
And she said that she just couldn't leave her mother
Well she said that she just couldn't leave - her mother

// Fool's Hall Of Fame //

Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day 
I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away 
That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame 
Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart 
It cries and cries all night long 
Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me 
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong 
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery 
You know I'll keep on a beggin till you come back to me 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame 
Ah baby since we've been apart I can't console my heart 
It cries and cries all night long 
Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me 
Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong 
Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery 
You know I'll keep on beggin till you come back to me 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame 
Don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame...

// Cold Shoulder //

There's a fire burning bright at our house tonight
Slow music playing and soft candlelight
On her lips I keep tasting the warm red wine
I'm there in her arms but it's all in my mind

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder

This old highway us like a woman
Sometimes she can be your best friend
But she's the real jealous kind
She's the lady that leads me to the life I dream of
She's the mistress that keeps me from the ones that I love

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover
I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder
God, I wish I could hold her instead of hugging this old cold shoulder

// Walking The Blues //

Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea fleein' to the sea
Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand
He said the next white man that sees my face is gonna be a dead white man
Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw
Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears
Well now they tell me...
Old Apache squaw
