// The Legend Of John Henry's Hammer //

John Henry's Papy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you, listen boy,
Said learn to ball a jack, learn to lay  a track, learn to pick and shovel too, and take my hammer, it'll do anything you tell it to

John Hery's mammie had about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line

Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do? 
And he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too
(can you swing a hammer boy?)
I can I'll do anything you hire me to

Now ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer

He said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do

With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel,
(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)
I was born for driven steel

Well John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring, 

But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you

John Henry said I feed four little brothers, and  my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam

John Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill

John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you

2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend, 

Captain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills

Well John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it

Take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, aint no machine can, that's been proved to you

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man

// Busted //

My bills are all due and the babies need shoes,
But I'm Busted
Cotton's gone down to a quarter a pound
And I'm Busted

I got a cow that's gone dry 
And a hen that won't lay
A big stack of bills
Getting bigger each day
The county's gonna haul my belongings away,
But I'm Busted

So I called on my brother to ask for a loan
'Cause I was Busted
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone,
But I'm Busted

My brother said, "there's not a thing I can do,
My wife and my kids 
Are all down with the flu
And I was just thinkin' about callin' on you,
'Cause I'M Busted."

Lord, I ain't no thief, but a man can go wrong,
When he's Busted
The food that we canned last summer is gone,
But I'm Busted

Now the fields are all bare
And the cotton won't grow
Me and my family's gotta pack up and go
But I'll make a living, just where, I don't know
'Cause I'm Busted

// Casey Jones //

Come all you rounders if you wanna hear
The story about a brave engineer
Casey Jones was the roller's name
On a 6-8-wheeler course he rode to fame
Caller called Casey 'bout half past four
He kissed his wife at the station door
He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
Said "this is the trip to the Promised Land"

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Through South Memphis Yards on a fly
Rain been a fallin' and the water was high
Everybody knew by the engine's moan
That the man at the throttle was Casey Jones

Well Jones said "Fireman now don't you fret"
Sim Webb said "I ain't a givin' up yet"
We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Dead on the rail was a passenger train
Blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
Casey said "Hey, look out ahead,
Sim, jump, Sim, jump, or we'll all be dead!"

With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake
North Mississippi was wide awake
IC railroad officials said
"He's a good engineer to be a laying dead"

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

Headaches and heartaches and all kind of pain
Are all a part of the railroad train
Sweat and toil, the good and the grand
Are part of the life of a railroad man

Casey Jones, climbed in the cabin
Casey Jones, orders in his hand
Casey Jones, leanin' out the window
Takin' a trip to the Promised Land

// Nine Pound Hammer //

Well, this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy
For my size, honey for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
And I ain't comin' back, Lord I ain't comin' back

Oh, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll

Well, it's a long way to Harlem, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal, out of number nine coal

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I go when my wheels won't roll
Oh, roll on buddy, pull a load o'coal
How can I go when my wheels won't roll

// Chain Gang //

I was just a kid roamin' around
Travelin' through, a little ol' town
A man walked up and said come with me
You're broke and son that's vagrancy

A carefree lad that love to roam
But Lord I wish I'd stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
'Cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang

I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang

The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess, I probably will some day
I'd rather be dead than to live this way

He's well fed and he's six foot tall
And he's a meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain

I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang

I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waitin' a long, long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame

Lord, deliver me from this hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There ain't no 'cause to laugh and joke

I dig that ditch, I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang

Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang
Work like a dog on a chain gang

// Waiting For A Train //

All around the water tank waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
Well I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
He said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door

Well he put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco headin' back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is willed with pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home just waitin' for a train

// Roughneck //

Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor

Well, I was born in a boomer shack
'Bout a half mile from town
Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew
And my mama never was around

I learn to cuss when I was two
And fight when I was three
And by the time I was five there was no kid alive
Could ever get the best of me

Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor

Well, I started workin' like a regular man
When I was just about knee high
Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands
But they never heard me cry

I remember walkin' down the road
And hearin' somebody say
He was born to live a rougneck's life
And he's never gonna change his ways

Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor

Born to be a roughneck
I'll never amount to nothin'
Pullin' case and layin' pipe
Is hard labor
