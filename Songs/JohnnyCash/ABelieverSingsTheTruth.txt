// I Was There When It Happened //

There are some people who say we cannot tell
Whether we are saved or whether all is well
They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within

Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know

Yes, I know when Jesus saved me, saved my soul
The very moment He forgave me, made me whole
He took away my heavy burdens
Lord, He gave me peace within, peace within

Satan can't make me doubt it, I won't doubt it
It's real and I'm gonna shout it, I'm gonna shout it
I was there when it happened
And so I guess I ought to know

// That's Enough //

Well now I heard that you been thinking bout me really I don't mind
I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time
Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad
Cause I can't miss a friend that I never had
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there) and troubled (he's there)
When I call him he will answer my prayers (answer my prayers)
When I'm burdened (he's there) with a load (he's there)
That's when Jesus is a comforter (to my soul)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
You know there's been a lotta times that I didn't have a dime
And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord
He heard my plea and came to see about me cause he's one thing I can afford
So if you push me down he'll pick me up
And he'll stick by me when the goin' gets tough
(I've got) I've got Jesus and that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator (Jesus is) yes he is
He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will (Jesus will)
Well you may scorn me turn your back on me
God's got his arms wrapped all around me
And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up
And that's enough (that's enough) that's enough
When I'm sick (he's there)....
