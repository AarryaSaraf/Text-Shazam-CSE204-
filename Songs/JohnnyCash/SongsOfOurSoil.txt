Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

A rose, a carnation, the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet
(Drink to me, drink to me)
But only the orchid was worthy of you, so I threw all the others away
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals

And after a day or two
The flower still blooms but the scent's not the orchids
It carries the savor of you

Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

So if you're gonna drink to me, drink with your eyes
And I'll never cry for wine
(Drink to me, drink to me)
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine
(Drink to me, drink to me)

'Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul
And honey from a sugar tree
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe
Honey come here and drink to me

Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me, drink to me
Drink to me

// Five Feet High And Rising //

My mama always taught me that good things come from adversity if we put our faith in the Lord.
We couldn't see much good in the flood waters when they 
were causing us to have to leave home, 
But when the water went down, we found that it had washed a load of rich black bottom dirt across our land. The following year we had the best cotton crop we'd ever had.

I remember hearing: 

How high's the water, mama?
Two feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa? 
Two feet high and risin'

We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
That's the only thing we got left that'll float
It's already over all the wheat and the oats, 
Two feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama? 
Three feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa? 
Three feet high and risin'

Well, the hives are gone, 
I've lost my bees
The chickens are sleepin'
In the willow trees
Cow's in water up past her knees, 
Three feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama? 
Four feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa? 
Four feet high and risin'

Hey, come look through the window pane,
The bus is comin', gonna take us to the train
Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain, 
4 feet high and risin'

How high's the water, mama? 
Five feet high and risin'
How high's the water, papa? 
Five feet high and risin'

Well, the rails are washed out north of town
We gotta head for higher ground
We can't come back till the water comes down, 
Five feet high and risin'

Well, it's five feet high and risin'

// The Man On The Hill //

Will we get cold and hungry
Will times be very bad?
When we're needin' bread and meat
Where we gonna get it, Dad?

We'll get it from the man
In the house on the hill
Yes we will from the man on the hill

Ploughin' time is over
Still the fields are bare
How we gonna make a livin'
With twenty acres to share?

I'll beg for more land
From the man on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill

I ain't got no Sunday shoes
That I can wear to town
Papa reckon the boss has got
A pair of hand-me-downs

I'll go and ask the man
In the house on the hill
Yes I will, I'll ask the man on the hill

Maybe he will help us
Maybe we'll get by
But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills
If we all should die

We'll leave it to the man
In the sky when we die
Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky

// Hank And Joe And Me //

In the desert where we searched for gold
The days're hot the nights're cold
Hank and Joe and me walked on
So bold and brave and free

For days and days we fought the heat
I got so thirsty and I got so weak
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go
I heard Hank say to Joe

He's dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Hear him cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water

Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water

I don't remember how long I lay
But when I awoke it was the break of day
Buzzards circled miles ahead
I knew Hank and Joe were dead

My eyes were dimmed but I could see
A bed of gold nuggets under me
Now I know that it won't be long
Till they decorate my bones

'Cause I'm dyin'
(Dyin' dyin')
For water
Can't help cryin'
(Cryin' cryin')
For water

Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said
Joe you know he's a dyin' man
Leave him there and let him die
I can't stand to hear him cry for water
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water

// Clementine //

(Oh my darlin' Clementine)

She knew that Cody was the man she wanted
But she had waited nearly all her life
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife

(Don't you worry)
Clementine

Cody saddled up and left his darlin'
Then rode to town to celebrate his plan
He told 'em this would be his last carousing'
"I'm gonna settle down boys if I can"

(With my darlin')
Clementine

Someone said, "It must have been past midnight
When Cody had to face a jealous man "
Another story goes that no one really knows
But it seems there was a dance hall girl called Nan

(Don't you tell)
Clementine

We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room
Then there was a silence in the place
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down
They found Cody lyin' on his face

(Softly callin')
Clementine

So buddies, make a monument to lay down at his head
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind
Mother, help your daughter put her weddin' dress away
'Cause Cody won't be ridin' back this time

(To his darlin')
Clementine

// Don't Step On Mother's Roses //

We all were called to come back
To the old home on the farm
Mother's passed away, what a mournful day
And as my daddy watched
His eyes were filled with pain and hurt
When someone stepped upon a rose
And crushed it in the dirt

"Don't step on Mother's roses," Daddy cried
"She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place"

"Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow"

Years have passed away
And how the old home place has changed
Daddy had to go, we all miss him so
Children pick the roses as they go along the way
But when their petals are abused, I hear my daddy say

"Don't step on Mother's roses," Daddy cried
"She planted them the day she was my bride
And every time I see a rose, I see her smilin' face
She made my darkest days look bright
'Round the old home place"

"Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow
The way they did since many years ago
They'll bloom for me each year
And I'll have Mother near
Don't step on Mother's roses, let 'em grow"

// Great Speckled Bird //

What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

// I Want To Go Home //

We sailed on the ship John B, my grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

The first mate, he got drunk, broke up the people's trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

Then the cook, he caught the fits, threw out all of my grits
Then he took and ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, this is the worst trip since I have been born

So hoist up the John B sail, see how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore, let me go home
Let me go home, why don't you let me go home?
Well, I feel so homesick I wanna go home

// The Caretaker //

I live in the cemetery
'Old Caretaker' they call me
In the wintertime I rake the leaves
And in the summer I cut the weeds

When a funeral comes
The people cry and pray
They bury their dead
Then they all go away

And here I work
And I somehow hide
From a world that rushes
By outside

But each night
When I rest my head
I'm contented
As the peaceful death

But who's gonna cry
When old John dies?
Who's gonna cry
When old John dies?

Once I was a young man
Dashing with the girls
Now no one wants an old man
When I lost my handsome curls

But I wanna say
When my time comes
Lay me facin'
The rising sun

Put me in a corner
Where I buried my pup
Tell the preacher to pray
Then cover me up

Don't lay flowers
Where my head should be
Maybe God would
Let some grow for me

And all the little children
That I love like my own
Will they be sorry
That Old John's gone?

Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies?
Who's gonna cry
When Old John dies?

// Old Apache Squaw //

Old Apache Squaw, how many long lean years you saw?
How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee?
Shiverin' in a cold teepee
Old Apache Squaw, how many hungry kids you saw?
How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea, fleein' to the sea?

Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man"

Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
Have you had misty eyes for years?
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?

Well, now they tell me that you saw Cochise
When he made his last stand
He said, "The next white man that sees my face
Is gonna be a dead white man"

Old Apache Squaw, how many broken hearts you saw?
You've had misty eyes for years
Could that mist be tears? Could that mist be tears?

// My Grandfather's Clock //

My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride
But it stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
tik,tlk,tik,tok
His life seconds numbering
tik,tok,tik,tok
It stopped, short never to go again
When the old man died

My grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound

And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
And its hands never hung by its side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
As we silently stood by his side
But it stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
His life seconds numbering
It stopped short, never to go again
When the old man died

// It Could Be You (Instead Of Him) //

If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this earth can't reach his gold
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and dim

Lend the hand, say a prayer
Give a smile that he might share
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him)

Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to make his burdens light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a friend
(Be a friend)

Shed a tear, share a sight
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)

Shed a tear, share a sigh
Share his fears don't pass him by
But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him
(It could be you instead of him)

// I Got Stripes //

On A Monday I Was Ar-rested (Uh Huh)
On A Tuesday They Locked Me In The Jail (Oh Boy)
On A Wednesday My Trial Was At-tested
On A Thursday They Said Guilty And The Judge's Gavel Fell

I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down

On A Monday My Momma Come To See Me
On A Tuesday They Caught Me With A File
On A Wednesday I'm Down In Solitary
On A Thursday I Start On Bread And Water For A While

I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me Down

I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
I Got Chains - Chains Around My Feet
I Got Stripes - Stripes Around My Shoulders
And Them Chains - Them Chains They're About To Drag Me

// You Dreamer You //

I dreamed I walked in a field of flowers 
Oh, what a dream 
The houses all were silver towers 
Oh, what a dream 
Beside the road an angel sat, 
I said hello and tipped my hat 
And stopped when I saw her smile 
And set me down a while 
I set me down a while 
You dreamer you

I tried the angel for a kiss 
Oh, what a dream 
But she turned away and my lips missed 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I'll have you know 
I met you just a while ago 
You're welcome for to sit 
But calm yourself a bit, sir 
Calm yourself a bit 
You dreamer you

I fell in love like one, two, three 
Oh, what a dream 
I asked the angel to marry me 
Oh, what a dream 
She said, "Sir, I can't marry you, 
But I'm a dream that can come true 
There are dreams of much my worth 
That live upon the earth, sir 
Live upon the earth 
You dreamer you"

Then I awoke and found my love 
Oh, what a dream 
As heavenly as the one above 
Oh, what a dream 
We'll marry in a sea of flowers, 
Home will be a silver tower 
There'll be heaven in my life 
With an angel for a wife 
With an angel for a wife 
You dreamer you 
You dreamer you
