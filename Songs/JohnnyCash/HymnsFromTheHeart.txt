// He'll Understand And Say Well Done //

Give, when you give Him the best of your service
Tellin' the world that the savior has come
Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
He'll understand and say, "Well done"

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, "Well done"
He'll understand and say, "Well done"

Misunderstood the savior of sinners
Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
Would understand and say, "Well done"

Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
He'll understand and say, "Well done"

// God Must Have My Fortune Laid Away //

God has my fortune laid away

Oh, the world is full of people with money just to burn
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day
God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away
(God has my fortune laid away laid away, laid away)

Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be
Some people live in riches while some live just like me
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay
But God has my fortune laid away
(Laid away)

I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame
Pockets that stay empty, dreams that go astray
God has my fortune laid away

// I Got Shoes //

When I get to Heaven gonna put on my robe
I'm gonna shout all over God's Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
Ain't goin' there Heaven Heaven
Gonna shout all over God's Heaven

I got a harp, you got a harp, all of God's children got a harp
Oh Glory when I get to Heaven gonna play on my harp
I'm gonna play all over God's Heaven Heaven

Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven

Going play all over, gonna walk all over God's Heaven

// When I've Learned Enough To Die //

(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)

I've met the Master on my knees
I was tested I was tried
I've seen the God of heaven
Paint the fields and country side

I've been the husband of one wife
Heard my newborn baby cry
But when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die

I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down

I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die

Old enough to die
(When I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die old enough to die)

I've always been a hard working man
No stopping place have I found
But when I'm tired I'm still inspired
At night when I lie down

I've learned to kinda like this earth
Some time I wonder why
Cause when I've learned enough to really live
I'll be old enough to die
Old enough to die

// Let The Lower Lights Be Burning //

Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost

Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save

// If We Never Meet Again //

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
'Til we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore

If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever
And where separation come no more
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Oh so often we are parted with sorrow
And action often quietens our pain
But we never shall sorrow in heaven
God be with you till we meet again

// When I Take My Vacation In Heaven //

There are those who are taking vacations
To the mountains the lakes and the sea
Where they rest from their cares and their troubles
What a wonderful time that must be

But it seems not my lot to be like them
I must toil through the heat and the cold
Seekin' out the lost sheep on a mountain
Bringing wanderers back to the fold

But when I take my vacation in Heaven
What a wonderful time that will be
Hearing concerts by the Heavenly chorus
And the face of my Saviour I'll see

Sitting down on the banks of the river
'Neath the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me

Sitting down on the banks of the river
Under the shade of the evergreen tree
There I'll rest from my burdens forever
Won't you take your vacation with me

// Taller Than Trees //

On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and pain
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees

One night it was a long time ago now
I knelt at my mother's knee
And she said, "Son lift up your eyes to Him in the skies
And you'll grow like the mighty oaks
But you son, created in the image of God
Can become taller even taller than the tallest of trees"

And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt

"On your knees you're taller than trees
You can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all of your pains"

When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go, growing stronger and taller than trees

// I Won't Have To Cross Jordan Alone //

When I come to the river at the ending of day 
When the last winds of sorrow have blown 
There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone 
In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone 

Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad 
When it seems that my friends have all flon 
There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad 
I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan... 

Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep 
Christ the Saviour will care for his own 
Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone 
I won't have to cross Jordan...

// When He Reached Down His Hand For Me //

(When he reached down his hand for me) 
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be 
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above 
When he reached down his hand for me 
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me 
I was lost and undone without my God or his son 
When he reached down his hand for me 

I was near to despair when he came to me there 
And he showed me that I could be free 
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete 
When he reached down his hand for me 
When he reached down...

// My God Is Real //

There are some things I may not know
There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

Some folks may doubt, some folks may scorn
Well, they can all go on, just leave me alone
But ask for me, I'll take God's part
My God is real for I can feel Him in my heart

My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

// These Hands //

These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family, these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord

These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone

Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life hasn't been a success
Some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness

Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands

Take a look at these hard working hands
