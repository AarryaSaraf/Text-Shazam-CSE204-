// I'll Remember You //

I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
I'll be lonely oh so lonely
Living only to remember you

I'll remember too
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
Your sweet laughter, mornings after
Ever after, I'll remember you

To your arms someday I'll return to stay
Till then I will remember too
Every bright start we made wishes upon
Love me always, promise always
Oooh, youll remember too

// Second Honeymoon //

I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon

I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon

// Honky Tonk Girl //

Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl
'Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl

Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl
'Cause she's just a honky tonk girl
