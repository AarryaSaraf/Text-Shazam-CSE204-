// Lost On The Desert //

A burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky 
Stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die 
I had to give up and they took me to jail but I hid all the money I got 
Way out on the desert where no one could get it and I left a mark at the spot 
Then I got away and I ran for the desert the devil had taken control 
I needed water but he said I'd make it near the money is a big waterhole 
A burnin' hot sun... 

Just up ahead is where I left my mark or it may be to the left or the right 
I've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow I've got to find it tonight 
Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry 
He moved my mark till I'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die 
A burnin' hot sun... 
(Lost on the desert to die) lost on the desert to die (lost on the desert to die)

// Accidentally On Purpose //

Accidentally I saw you this morning
You were lovely dressed in your wedding gown
And they say that you married a stranger to me
That had drifted to our old hometown

Accidentally you've met him one evening
And you say it was love at first sight
Accidentally on purpose you've married
Accidentally on purpose for spite

'Cause I saw out cheatin' and runnin' around
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown
Accidentally you were mistaken that night
Accidentally on purpose for spite

'Cause I saw out cheatin'

// In The Jailhouse Now //

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They got him in the jailhouse way down town

He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
Well she started in to spend my money
She started in to call me honey
We took in every honky tonk in town

We're in the jailhouse now
We're in the jailhouse now
They told us once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
We're in the jailhouse now

// Mr. Lonesome //

I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be 
Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round 
Don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody 
Oh Mr Lonesome got me down 
He makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty 
Happiness is one thing he can't stand 
Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me 
Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand 
And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be 
If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me 
And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down

// You Won't Have Far To Go //

I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards 
When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go 
Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand 
But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go 
You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you 
And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go 

You won't have far to go...

// In Them Old Cottonfields Back Home //

When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle 
In them old cottonfields back home 
When I was a little bitty baby... 
Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton 
In them old cottonfields back home 
It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana 
In them old cottonfields back home 

When I was a little bitty baby... 
When I was a little bitty baby... 
In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home

// I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know //

You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her
You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me
But you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be
You think she's yours to have and to hold
But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold
That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You stole her love from me...

// You Remembered Me //

You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times when I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
You remembered only to count the days till spring
You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
(I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me)

I believed that promises were made to break apart
But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
(There were times that I forgot but you remembered me)

You remembered only that wedding bells would ring...

// Let Me Down Easy //

Let me down easy if you must go why not deceive me it won't hurt me so 
Truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and I'll get by 
Let me down easy for old time's sake 
Is it too much to ask when my heart's gonna break 
I'm bound to lose you I'm bound to cry oh let me down easy and I'll get by 

Let me down easy..

// Sing It Pretty, Sue //

So you gave up all between us for a glamorous carear 
And with all your talent you should be the big star of the year 
Then you'll be public property so I release my claim to you 
Go on and give 'em all you've got sing it pretty Sue 
I can't take just part of you and give the world a half 
So Smile for all the papers and give 'em autographs 
Go on to all the cities so your public can see you 
But I'll watch on television so sing it pretty Sue 

I hope you'll soon be on the top of every hitparade 
I'll try to be excited bout the progress that you've made 
I'll collect your pictures like any fan would do 
And I'll buy all your records so sing it pretty Sue 
But I won't ever tell a soul that we have ever met 
I'll just be one of millions who'll give the praise you get 
And maybe every year or so I'll drop a card to you 
To tell you I'm still listening so sing it pretty Sue
